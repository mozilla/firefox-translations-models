What will he do? ČSSD in Prague knows Voldemort or confectionery
The new councillors of the capital of the ČSSD will have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the council.
The daily Aktuálně.cz has "tested" members of the new board of ČSSD, as they know the notorious slang, which originated at the town hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The encoded dictionary, which the Prague political elite introduced during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turns out that the new councillors do not understand well-known concepts.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer in Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, a councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "godly" glossary.
And although it is a political veteran, the councillor Karel Březina reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"It's the only expression of the ones you present to me, which I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't generally recognize slang."
From the dictionary, whose terms Aktuálně.cz published in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mainly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", "go to the patisserie", "bubble of the neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "talk" and "talk".
The trio of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is supposed to head the Prague education system in the future - he promised the interview at first, but later he did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate the way Democrats have fun."
"I'm now figuring out how we're going to understand each other within our programs," he said.
As it has already been said, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have any idea in the headline that we are talking about the influential businessman and friend of the ex-mayor Bém Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" Kaucký is not known to him, and the only date he correctly estimated in the exam is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," Kaukicky says, adding: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole as a tunnel of Blanka decrypts not only the matador Karel Březina, but also by the environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý.
The two Social-Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukas Plachý is familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the term "go to the patisserie".
"I mean, that means going to a Prague business," says Plachý, close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In the same way, he recalls that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the students of the test, there is no such established glossary of slang expressions.
"I consulted my colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We say to ourselves rather names, sometimes abbreviations and corruption of names are used," says Petr Hulínský, chairman of the Prague ČSSD, who is nicknamed Hulda.
"At school, I was called Birch, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina confesses to his own nickname.
The daily Aktuálně.cz tried and worked.
Councillor Weinert is for party members Děda or less friendly Dědek, a representative of Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections fraud in sponsorship of the party, has the nickname "Igráček" for some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in intra-party speaking admit.
Hulínský is said to not be happy to hear Hulda, but the daily Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague chairman.
The "Difficid law" is said to remind us that Petr Hulínský won his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
Government wants to limit the torture of "witches", publishes brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common signs.
They belong to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example, for health reasons, they are free and do not have children.
The one who "gets the witch" is sent into isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"A man will rarely make this fate."
“Early young healthy women are not sung by because they help work and give birth to children,” says the nun, who in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso takes care of more than a hundred women who have expelled their community from among them.
The local government has now decided to crack down on the unusual "social measure".
She has published an information brochure that should help curb witches hunt.
But the thing has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," Die Standard said.
Charges of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which is adjacent to Burkina Faso, seventy-two-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured kerosene and set her on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
On the woman, according to their version, the oil ignited, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said he flared after the group wanted to "pull the evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of educational attainment.
The daily Der Standard quoted a forty-two-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul eaters have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, the president himself participated in the Gambia last year.
"Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, unleashed a large-scale witch hunt that was alleged to have been involved in her death and try to kill the president himself with black magic."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea, who accompanied by police, soldiers and personal security of the president, forcibly took away randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Canilai," Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, trapped people had to drink a potion from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which additionally caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two incarcerated stay on the farm did not survive.
After international pressure, almost a thousand imprisoned were finally released.
Bakal's tenant: Heating in the stove, signed a higher rent
An older stocky man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG Byty "Uhlobaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, he carried a file, and in it new leases to three apartments: his daughter, his daughter and his son, who is serving his sentence.
It was the deregulation that lifted the rent for all three.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay CZK 4100 for an apartment of the 2+1 of the second category from next year.
"And there is no hot water and there must be petrama (hard fuel-fly) shredded," the man points with his finger in his son's new contract, for whose signature he has the power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he explains half angrily and half resignedly.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waves his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic await.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
Havířov waiting room RPG is one of four in the Ostrava region and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Right next door is a security guard from the security agency and a starting device.
"The lease 2011", shines a special button on its touch screen.
One tap and a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already beeping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're up.
After a while, an elderly married couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not concern the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new lease agreements in the Ostrava region are received by tenants of most of the 44 thousand RPG portfolio apartments in the mailboxes from about mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes them in letters to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new rents was opened on the client centre on November 18.
"It's been going through a week, so it's only in the run-in," the workers behind the counter after a moment's hesitation, when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a looted topic.
Before the elections, he was quite loudly seized by the vice-chairman of the parliament and the Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years after them, I've been asking for a new floor."
"Neither the board in the toilet was replaced by me," the man relieves himself at the beginning.
Most of the time being, according to the workers, pensioners come to see if they get a discount on the lease if they sign on time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half a discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
However, the Havířov "deregulatory" counter is definitely not overwhelmful with questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about forty to fifty people because of the lease for 2011," the worker said.
RPG proposes individual contract negotiation on the web and its boards where it is needed.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be designated by an independent court.
"This is not about threatening, but information about only possible and completely legitimate legal action," the RPG said.
“No one will be suing here,” one of the workers of RPG Byty thinks, and the man on the street in front of the client center partially agrees with her.
"I have 13 thousand pensions and I have five thousand left to eat, I don't have the place to judge myself," he says.
The worker will be insecure.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he says.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent is still not reaching the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the angry tenant's negligence of the housing stock is, according to the homeowners, the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPGs could invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the large-scale screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats several red highlighted information.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less affects 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," it appears on the screen.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent will rise by 38%.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," warns the RPG.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive the rents in a leap, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see chart) will be put back into apartments, mainly in heat savings - new windows and insulation.
Preferably, they are to be given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include the kindergarten, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design.
No one would expect it to hide a mini-kindergarten with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be attended by the children of Arch.Design employees.
The design-architectural company Arch.Design, whose studios emerged a number of important Brno buildings, have been counting on space for its corporate mini-kinders since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly in the age of a babyboom, and it was important to keep the women’s designers and architects from returning to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of part-time jobs, the nursery is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of the social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with childcare.
The mini-kindergarten was invented by Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of management they managed to obtain a subsidy of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The corporate mini-kinders (Companies) is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy of CZK 2, 8 million. CZK) could buy equipment and equipment and for two years provide qualified staff and operation.
After the financial subsidy is drawn up (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to run a mini-kind for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and Economy Rating significantly helped with the application for the subsidy.
Care is provided by qualified staff, children are cared for all day by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "mini-kindergarten", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will be replaced during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible according to the needs of parents, and the children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kind is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic cognition to preparation for school desks, the English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and stressful situations with delayed picking up children from kindergartens away from their parents' workplaces are eliminated.
Parents use working hours more productively.
It is not surprising that a naturally loyal relationship of an employee - an employer - is formed here.
Arch.Design thus ranks among Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in hiring new employees, are family-friendly and through this program strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of the bones fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the spine of the dinosaur, and the balconies are open to fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house has earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaic, a facade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of the Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudí.
The facade of the house is played by dream lines, tender colors and textures resembling nature and animals.
In the detailed observation, you can see the geometry, rhythm and precisely thoughtful order.
At night, the whole facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of colors is further enhanced.
The winding and twisting of shapes with the same degree appears in the interiors.
Wood in the waves copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepholes and skirting boards.
Batlló House, which stands in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea for an unusual and cheaper redevelopment.
The apartment building Casa Batlló was not proposed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
He was co-operated by architect Josep Maria Jajol.
It was on his designer board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of a mosaic on the facade.
A number of other artists worked on the facade.
Joint work on the designs of the house Casa Batlló started the successful cooperation of Jejola with Gaudí.
Jjol was involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house and Güell Park, which includes Gaudí's other works.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion earned the nickname "House of Bones".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening windows, began to call it "the yawning house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for his time with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree inclination.
In the creation of Gaudí absolutely disrespected the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, it obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later during the completion, the city council was terrified by the result and asked for a remedy.
Councillors were bothered, for example, by the fact that the building also interfered with the pillars and the public pavement.
Remediation never happened, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the call of the city district, Josep Batlló applied (and successfully obtained) permission to lease the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social lounge and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house intersects a staircase, which can climb up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all the right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting space.
The social part can be completely connected by opening a lounge door, and a larger company can communicate comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations at the same time.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also acquired an unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
Gaudí’s play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which are clad the inner courtyard and skylights, is also impressive.
The game of two colors gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbed by the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and opulent apartment open to the public.
The owners decided to do this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the centenary of the birth of the famous creator.
They remained in the tours because they found out that it was a very advantageous business and, in addition, the tours were extended by common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20 percent discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly befriend one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grate: women have different requirements than men
Not the ostentatious bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface, that is, the mattress and grate, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, a lot of things decide, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior into which the mattress and grate are purchased.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages, where they do not heat regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they are slower to "heat".
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
They must be reversed regularly.
If they do not have a lot of venting canals in the core, and still lie on a solid plate, they retain moisture: Mold could also appear under them.
The custom also decides when choosing.
Who has spent a longer period of time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, it will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who were returning from the NHL complained to me that they would not sleep here."
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Such are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misunderstand "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Therefore, many hockey players, as well as other customers, were looking for mattresses with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's fine, the appropriate mattress has Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "mad" works simply.
It optimizes your stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't be overturned at night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height, add the length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be for a double bed of 90 cm, a total of 180 cm.
For separate beds, for example, singleslists, at least 120 to 140 cm are recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Othern is the rule for the width of the bed simple: when lying on your back, your hands should be comfortable slightly bended at the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, guildmaster of the Purcruil and Decorators Guild, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleeping and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs its own grate and mattress, but here be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the grates to different heights, but you may not be able to do this with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with spring skeleton at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on a shaping and bribe layer.
"When you touch your hands or sit on the mattress, you must definitely not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
All-rounded beds, where mattresses and bases are like the merged Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses ventilate poorly, you can not wash their cover, which is already common.
And since we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years of the mattress, it will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) strainer.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, advice from the sellers: do not give up the removable mattress for 120 or 140 cm mattresses and washing removable coating, but add a mattress protector, which you can lightly remove and wash.
Although mattress covers are commonly made today with roughings around the entire perimeter, so after unzipping we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), yet manipulation on larger types (and in one person) when shooting could resemble a light-weight duel in the ring with a heavy one.
Do you have a solid board in bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum on the bed intended for one night visits.
However, you can still provide the plate (if it no longer has them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from Taschenfederkern) and a baking layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a substrate.
For non-positioning slat grates with 14 to 18 slats will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always pay off grates with a larger number of slats, 28 or more, where the slats are doubled in the lumbar area and their stiffness can be regulated.
The positioning lamella grates do not include mattresses with a spring-beam skeleton, because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjust the rigidity of the slats, the so-called shoulder cradle can also be indulged in.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper nicely "squapped".
For men who have "arms across their backs" definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers, who in the "men's" began to use the softening zone in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they indulge in a softer surface in places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate grates with so-called multitorz suspension.
The pressure spreads to multiple points and the tension is reduced.
However, beware, once you use the wrong pillow (large and "blooded") on the right mattress and grate, most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and to the toes only extend to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm are recommended, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original strams stuffed grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least admixtures.
The trend is also in bio mattresses.
The raw materials from the oil from which polyurethane foams are replaced by natural oils, such as jumping and soybean.
Soybeans are used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vasicek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to relax the fresh scent of the forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man is "cooled" by plant extract from birch to absorb the mattress cover heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary, the covers "heat".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so the weaker sex is warmer.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with impaired cellular structure, so it is more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
Combining various stiffnesses of cold foams and "lazy" foam, multi-zone mattresses are created, which knows exactly where the head, loins and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters have a lower VAT rate, are taken as medical aids.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and a grate is not easy.
Sometimes you can use, for example, the events of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with sewn memory foam Memory to cover for 11 990 crowns.
The second one can be done for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density started at the "cosmic" pace of the material Tempura.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, as astronauts were exposed to enormous overload during launches.
The temper in the heat softens, on the contrary, it strengthens in the cold.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimally its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the appearance of bedsores, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example, on special pillows under the feet, which lightens the legs and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want to track people, so they want to guard their children
Fear for your own child is bringing more and more people to the idea of GPS babysitting.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is so far about a size like a box from matches, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and began to look for the means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not a spying, but another means to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy will happen," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases, such devices can be misused, such as if they put in a bag for someone who doesn't know about it, but we haven't encountered such a case yet."
"Mostly, customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "box" serves and how it is used in an emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything like that, she will simply get rid of it.
"Even very young children are showing great creativity in how to intentionally lose some things when they don't want to be under control."
"Various expectations were previously raised by mobile phones, which, however, can be turned off as well as these tracking devices," Bočková said.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"As far as the abduction is under preparation, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child does not have any electronics on him that could reveal his position."
"Now it's the phone."
"When the tracking devices start expanding, they will look for them as well, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of an unnecessary pedophile attack.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the surveillance equipment is immediately destroyed after the attack occurs, its presence may help.
"The device can be set to regularly send position after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"The more expensive devices have built-in and tiltometers, so even if a person just slips and remains motionlessly lying down, the device will immediately send a warning with the location," Čech said.
According to him, a similar service can be done by smartphones with navigation, where you just need to upload special software.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
This is always the risk of losing them.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, this is now testing a device that looks like a regular digital watch.
"This will have the greatest advantage in that any aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"They don't know them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the surveillance equipment will be put into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology as used for car guarding.
It is a combination of positioning through a GPS system (which use common autonavigations) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position of the car.
The army has inflatable cords to wrap up the Czech Republic. But it only lasts two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords, which launches explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The military has 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two, maximum four years.
The army bought the incendiary cords from the stock STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justification for the purchase of such a huge amount of incendiary cords, MF DNES wrote off that the soldiers consume 60 kilometers of inches per year during the training.
However, the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES approached, show that all generals, officers of the command of the army, secretaries or cleaners, would have to go through very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Minister of Defense Alexander Vondra and the commander of the army Vlastimil Pick included.
Only in this way could the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of incinerators can be justified.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if that were the case, the military's stockpile would be enough for over a decade.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each new professional, it is enough for a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord, as experts say, the army secured a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of engineering or special units - supplies for the mentioned 225 years.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no charge for small arms, so even shootings are limited due to an emergency for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't bother me, too, that they buy so many inches from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they're up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as traders try to accommodate," says business manager of STV Group Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometers of purchased cords by the fact that the army will have stockpiles of this "munit" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only about the four-year life of the fuse and police or army pyrotechnicians even only two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to disclose the name because of the criticism of the army.
After the expiration of the life, each munitions must be carefully tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is a quantity discount on 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"It cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," Pejšek said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of the launching cords of police pyrotechnicians, who are destroying ammunition from the Second World War or here after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to consume this munitions before the expiration of the life.
It has proven to be due to the safety of pyrotechnicians, and it can also more flexibly obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already having a lot of trouble with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the two-hundred-thousand-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to campaign for the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES has addressed, is facing the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometers of old fuse that "lacino" is shopping today.
To this day, I draw from the contacts I won thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Tradesman of the Year competition was helped by Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the Tradesman of the Year competition was the twenty-eight-year entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberec.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a semi-destroyed house with five apartments.
For the fact that he was still a student of the third year of college at that time, that was a great courage.
"The ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation did not give me the ratio of the quality and the price of accommodation in our country, so that I would not try to do something in it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
He invested all the profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a guesthouse with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually opened four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, he has added another, equally high-quality.
"We have just signed a contract with the hotel in Ostrov u Tisá, where we sold our franchise concept and other people interested in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels are reporting," says last year's tradesman number one.
"And this sale of the license to operate the hotel was largely contributed by the victory in the Tradesman of the Year competition," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater affiliation and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People got to know me on the streets, I was often congratulated and I have to say that it was pleasant," she recalled.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not even necessary to win, every visibility is good.
He says that to this day he draws on contacts and agations that he might not have gotten to otherwise.
"I started trading regularly with some of whom I met thanks to the competition."
According to him, the fame associated with success also affected every employee.
And that he's about seventy of them.
"I observe greater loyalty and pride in their participation in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal achievement, it's the result of good work of all of us together."
"Just my name is pushed to the fore," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Euphoria from victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the purpose of the winner, however, Farmet has had worse times.
The owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came for the first prize for the first place in the previous year’s Vodafone Company of the Year competition in Slovanský dům last year.
At that time, the jury appreciated the effort through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small tool shop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my collaborators and boosted our confidence for the match with the competition," the winner said.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský to rent a small workshop as compensation for the communists confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father he founded a company for plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in the presses of vegetable oil.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the non-professional public was gained after the achieved success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they cooperate with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not only in the face of euphoria from victory.
The award was based on the company’s financial results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for the sale of engineering goods.
The culmination of the crisis, which was not yet affected by citizens, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and began to limit purchases of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not affected us either."
"Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were also redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
What they did not discount from in Farmet, however, is investment in research and development.
"From the subsidies we built a research and training center, we strengthened the presentation at international trade fairs, received the main award in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Revenue is rising again, and with it the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A poll that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year’s Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to wear documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
This was decided by more than a third of the less than four thousand votes.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can get it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the poll, that will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during inspections of insurance payers," ČSSA spokeswoman Jana Buraňová said.
To light up all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and the nonsensical ones are the meaning of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This year it is a fourth part of the business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny and is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If about three thousand votes took part in the vote last year, this year there were almost four thousand.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations that serve only to delay business, there are still enough and enough of us.
"For the number of tax lasters for tax returns, we are at the top of the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, simplifying business has become a proclaimed target of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is conducted annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can submit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition deadline is.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is then selected by the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote on it via the Internet during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred have been applied for this year's survey, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, there was, for example, a demand between the nominees that cars for the maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the competition's website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by a personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, this culmination of the competition was assisted by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic.
"Easy prosperity cannot function where the state throws sticks under the feet of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen sections every year, which today only unnecessarily complicates business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to abolish nonsensical regulations does not sound empty.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the Trade Licensing Office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to the exhibition or the pilgrimage.
This obligation was eliminated by the amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most charged obligation in 2007, which was the reporting of the Labour Office as its foreign employee, a business trip of up to 30 days was removed by the So-called Green Card Act.
And for the third time, all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two step scales in the office.
This year, this year, the Ministry of Health Decree was eased - the obligation to have a refrigerator fell away.
The new category appreciates socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational and sports projects are evaluated.
A novelty in this year's fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competitions is the category entitled Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a sensible and fair business.
"We would like to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional mobile operator manager, Vodafone, which is an announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the rebel-general competition.
This year’s first edition of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 has been entered by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish a separate article.
Although the subject of their activity differs diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, for example, it affects disabled people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen nationwide finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
Its disabled employees are taken care of by the paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of them, and therefore it has won the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it ranked third in the region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionate reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for preferringly buying from Czech manufacturers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment," explains executive director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem Region thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and at its corporate events uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Romani community," says the company's representative Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundering and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of above-standard bonuses.
"In our country, we give contributions to food, transport, increase qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded by the organizer from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
"Separaate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested during a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The iron detectives deployed to the local businessman in the media sphere and real estate dealer Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public tender to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would get specific bidders.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns for Luboš G.
"In the meantime, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the mischievance of the inspicy in a public contract and in a public tender," Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor's Office, told Právo, adding that further details could not be provided with regard to the ongoing investigation.
The forty-six-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours by police.
Given the minimum of official information, it is only possible to speculate on how he could influence the public tender.
A spokeswoman for the Land Fund, Lubomír Černá, said that police officers were actually arrested at a secluded workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
"This was a client, not our employee," she clarified.
According to Černý, the public tender is entitled "Call for the offer of land transfer claims under the Land Act" and is held in the case where more eligible applicants show interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the call, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the offered entitlements, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who signed up for the call, and because he himself is also an authorized person, because he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the interested party for the land that he would not participate in the competition.
He probably collected severance pay for it.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of former PF chief Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in alternative restitution, for which a decision on the location of the building was already issued.
It was then that Luboš G. received from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically at the place where the access road to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he exchanged them very advantageously with the municipality for a house in the very historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to agree to this, because otherwise it would endanger the construction by blocking the land.
Housing households pay hundreds a month
Households will have to pay extra from January not only for all kinds of energy, but also for aqueous and sewerage, heat supply and rents will grow somewhere.
Families will have to pull hundreds of crowns more per month from January than now.
Electricity will increase by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth in some cities you will have to pay for water supplies and many too will undercut central heat supply.
Electricity price increase should cost households in apartments a hundred crowns a year than now.
At the same time, all major suppliers have reduced the prices of power electricity, so the significant increase in support of energy production from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas is slightly more expensive, but at a time when people are the most heating and have the highest consumption.
It must therefore also count on hundreds of extra crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are more expensive across the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to location.
In particular, larger municipalities plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns per month for central heating from January, more than 1000 crowns a year by families in Liberec.
Residents of Prague are at risk of more than 9 percent of them being more expensive water and bottling if the city increases its rent from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Roasted CZK 6.8 percent will pay.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the nationwide comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it has watery and bottling to undercut by 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices in 450 thousand rental apartments, where regulation ends in January, can increase significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new amount of the rent intend to put the company in court.
Regulated rents, which are paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments, could rise by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally better whisky brand stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which they end up drinking most often in the care of doctors drunks, who have not been even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated from the monkey repeatedly in the hospital.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the reception of children's wards of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfashions, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department of the Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Právo.
"If they manage to pull the bottle from their father's closet, it's about whiskey, but otherwise fernet and vodka prevail."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into the juice and then it's not so much felt about them," the headmaster explained.
Eva Jurinová, spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, also agrees with him.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol, especially in elementary schools today."
"In some cases, it was a slivovitz they brought from home," Yurin said.
According to the head physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital intake are a fairly common phenomenon.
In front of Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances are transporting subdued schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl was lying here about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition center in Holešovice for some dance parties."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't find it odd at all, that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the head physician said.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring is considered the main cause of growing child drinking.
However, according to experts, it is not possible to talk about addiction in the true sense of the word.
"The term alcoholic refers to several years of chronic alcohol addiction with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more typical of the unsuccessful family-social background," explained Dr. Pelikan.
According to a spokeswoman for Yurin, about forty drunken children were hospitalized by mid-Nophras this year at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
However, only those with severe intoxication that had to remain in the hospital will get into the statistics.
The children's drunks, who are taken away by their parents after outpatient treatment, or the police will take them home, do not count.
Except when children just sit around school and drink a bottle of liquor, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink grief from a bad report card or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holidays."
"But I've seen seven children drunks on the receiving end of the witches at the same time," Pelican said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over who suffers from an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will quench irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They're actually better off because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience, and nothing hurts them."
"They are only confused about where they are," Pelikán admitted, adding that he sometimes spoils patients' pleasant mood at least by listing the costs that required their treatment.
Transport by ambulance and hospitalization in an acute bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied it as an educational tool, when I immediately told the children on the visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to earn for that one party," Pelikán added.
However, health insurance companies do not approach regression proceedings in which parents would enforce the cost of treatment in cases of child drunks.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft out of the total five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, on Tuesday flew to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far abroad, they have only been on exercises or demonstration years.
These are two-seat versions of the L-159T1, which have been operated by the Czech Army and which have been airworthy.
The remaining three machines are a single-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in Aero Vodochody and the trade broker - Omnipol - took over them last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, when the aircraft will physically depart from Vodochod is not yet known from the Defense Press Department.
"The single-seat L-159 aircraft for the exchange were earmarked from long-term deposits, without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's Ministry."
"The two-seater L-159T1 were exchanged in its current state and form," Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army would not stay without two-seater aircraft because the ministry signed a contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 worth CZK 200 million to convert four unnecessary L-159 aircraft into two two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, the EADS has pledged to push through some alliance countries into armament.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter for the customer, how he will implement this matter," Pejšek said.
Hospodářské noviny said some time ago that, for example, The Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The replacement of five L-159 for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not announce a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
The then defence leadership argued that by shifting the future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
Buying Casa planes is likely to have a trial.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense in a European court because it was supposed to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last one should come to Prague's Kbely airport in a fortnight.
Longer forefinger than ring finger is a lower risk of cancer
Men who have index finger longer than a ring finger are at a lower risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to a study published by the British Cancer Journal on Wednesday.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with a genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer patients and concurrently over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had their index finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those who had a index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, for men up to sixty, the decrease was even 87 percent.
The ratio of length of the two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Earlier research has shown that testosterone supports growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech News Agency that he clearly knows about this study, but it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer is "present".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and pate there is mostly snow, road workers in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between 89. and 93. kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars is also closed, and it also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The reporter of the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK) told the news outlet.
On the 91st kilometer there crashed a truck, on the 93. kilometer there collided two trucks, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
There were two trucks.
Drivers should drive down just behind Brno on the 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then drive on the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
There are several kilometers of columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a layer of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created, for example, on Prosek, clogged is also Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff is to meet again.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express trains due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. on the night of five to five in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already passable, but only with caution.
In the Vyškov region, three secondary roads are impassable, in the Brno region there are snow tongues in places, and in the Blansko region it is necessary to conquer some roads in higher places snow chains.
The most affected places were Vyškovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Cutters will need to be put into stretching them.
When they will be cleared cannot yet be estimated.
Caution in the White Carpathians region is necessary.
On the roads, which are maintained only by inert sprinkles for nature protection, there is a layer of up to five centimeters of snow, the Czech News Agency reported.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of snow fell, the most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian Region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually easing.
U.S. Soldiers Have New 'smart Weapon'
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a small super-acecntial cannon.
Its projectiles guide the laser with precision to several meters.
Special caliber hubs 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosives, effectively act as small garnets.
The cartridges can be programmed by erupting not only on impact to the target, but at any point of their ballistic course.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, and when the murderous rain of steel shrapnel descends on it, it can put him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry, which uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding a target, sending a laser beam to determine the distance, so he gets a specified intentional point, according to him adjusts the gauge and presses the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and launches a shot at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from an existing office building to Marienbader-square-short in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on Wednesday by a giant in the field that specializes in computers and their maintenance, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyons Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to a Fujit spokesperson, another 100 jobs of the group, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in the foreseeable future.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park are said to be more suitable for the working way of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Competent executive Bernd Wagner said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region caused joy to the winners and disappointments of the losers yesterday.
Markus Frank (CDU) said he had managed to win a "global player."
It is said to be a "fantastic manifestation of confidence in this location."
Fujitsu is said to be suitable for the city, the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was reported in time to informed the company's management about its intention.
"Of course we offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on the Marienbader-semployment.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is about avoiding a long occupancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on the Rathaus-square, which has been used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" was one of the most discussed construction plans of the spa town, along with other buildings on the Marienbader-space.
Between the railway station and the town hall, it was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticized both for the massive development of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri, a company of investment consulting and rating, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still linked to Siemens, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid after a year.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is the third-largest IT-provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park office building, 7000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the star-shaped ground plan, which is twenty years old, it is located, among others, the Central Union of Electrical and Electronic Industries.
Amazon turns server - threats against Assangem
Wikileaks is getting close.
The Amazon internet service has turned off the revealing platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened on political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the list of wanted by Interpol, is due to refrain from one newspaper paper in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the country of the Free," activists told Twitter's short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle a high number of access to documents in order to handle a high number of access to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this step: "Few - our dollars will now be spent by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped using its Wikileaks servers after Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators carried out the search, CNN released on Lieberman's information.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon to boycott, Britain's "Guardian" reported.
“I used to like Amazon to take this step sooner, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called on the other countries to prevent the platform from using servers.
“Wikileaks is acting illegally, outrageously and recklessly, and thus our national security is in danger and endangering life across the planet,” said a statement from a non-partisan senator.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list of searches for Interpol.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent" is staying 39-year-old Australian in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
An internet activist has always described investigations in Sweden as intrigues of his adversaries.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Haffsson said there were also threats.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, Haffsson said.
That's why the Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently responding to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, asked the person to be charged and executed for a person for being charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, one adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, said on television - probably ironically, Assange should be "micide" and Obama could use a "tarille."
Meanwhile, a verbal firefight broke between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for the recently released spy appeals to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in one person's opinion with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more significant than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively examining the security of its databanks.
A special appointee has appointed deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terrorist Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in structure" that are necessary after the publication of messages from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government also announced it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they were to be in danger because of publication on Wikileaks.
"We did everything to get in touch with them," Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them if it's necessary."
Ice Cream University
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better time of year.
There is a lot of interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatier and Gelateio.
Gelatiere, a bit outdated ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes out the ice cream from the refrigeration box with a spatula, wipes it in a wafer and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know even more about ice cream, you will not avoid the "Gelto-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, an ice cream maker set up an ice cream studio so that the ice cream from its machines fits the highest Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses about chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some people want a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others dare to the thin ice of their unclear desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream plant in Kair.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelaire Luciano Ferrari will first explain the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
The decisive factor is not only a good taste, but also silk softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the southern and patriotic icing on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a considerable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything up with an electronic program at 85 degrees and then cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns on the machine with a tap and leaks pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice creams.
Immediately the docent is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it has to be sold in one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer eats all ice grains.
Certain variations of the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the department of sweets.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"You should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with an ice cream made of white base mass, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now he is allowed to attend a course for ice cream machines.
Luciano always lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be done with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nut when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular ice cream from the kiwi will be made by a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture will properly emphasize the taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is purely a numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano takes out the device by which it determines the sugar content of the fruit (winners thus measure the must of the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical exertion as before.
It does not only help the device for automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools the temperature to minus.
Despite all automation, we can't avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo gets himself and his colleagues from above all the way down the fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In every course," believes Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in double light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well,” Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
Leading Efsa expert groups for genetically altered plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist union for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has made a decisive role in Efsa's control regulations for genetic plants, thus facing a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
The Efsa regulations are said to coincide in whole paragraphs with Ilsi documents, carrying a handwriting of an industry that should be controlled by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech highlights a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior executive from Efsa passed without additions or transitional times to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
Also, Central Germany (MDR) radio recently revealed the personnel link between the EU-inspection Authority with the Industrial Lobby, which has aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from the industry, if they are of high-quality quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But they have to prove them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It itself is referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, for estimation of the risk of biotechnology without a contract of lobbyists.
Independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically altered plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempted feeding, and that genetic plants' reactions to environmental effects are not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, a genetically altered corn in the field will do,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
"If there are no risks, how would they be found?" asks the Court of Justice.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching genestechnics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University in Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying, as in the US, and now also in Europe to increasingly influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are no longer connected to the corporations.
Studys that are critical for society are usually not published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck believes.
Footprint of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, about 400 kilograms in total.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgart station, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began tearing off a large chunk of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wing lay in the rubble.
Broken to 6000, 7000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft coarse stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He must not disappear."
It follows: "Lucky and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When he cut, he stifled the cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with these pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
A trace of rocks from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen on the former deponime of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man is dealing with old stones.
He bought everyone that was created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappearing into a depository," he says in his office, a wooden booth that was previously a guardhouse.
He tells him that he was swearing and threatening him when it said in September in all the newspapers that he had bought the remnants of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he talked to the opponents of the S-21 for days.
And he explained that he was not responsible for the demolition at all.
And when it happens, then it is most sensible when the stones continue to be used.
Then about 200 S-21-anticipes each took one about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it during rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest was sold for a long time.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from all corners and pulled away what fit in the trunk and the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long turned into "shades" or like the edges of flower beds with herbs.
“This stone is nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political insertion."
He gets into his off-road car and goes for a ride around his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then he was interested in computers, and eventually became a trader with stones.
And a lover of stones.
It has stored 40000 tons of stones.
It binds his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the largest old-stone merchant in the country.
He's braking.
In the snow lies artistically crafted sandstone.
"Once they belonged to Marien-most in Dresden," he says.
Sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're on the way up the woods.
It points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once there were blocks of Neckarstaison in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, a red granitation from the Sankt Blasien Temple, a tuf from a hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be hand-smaid and transported using simple hoists and bulls, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this was crushed."
He didn't become rich, not very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone dealer employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the one who valorates the remnants.
They have to go to Cologne anytime soon.
There will be stones rescued there, too.
Fighting talent for High-Potential
There are a lot of people at the snacks.
16 students are pushed by sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer have invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way, to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies strive for the smartest heads in the plant, as well as the company VW, succeed and bet on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums, even before they reach the labour market and be interested in others.
Since universities do not issue any lists of success of their students, companies try to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig, the auto company is trying to win talents the next day.
One young lady from the personal department gives away pens, gummy bears and plates with the VW logo.
It tells promising young talents about programs for practices, student jobs and indicates their way to the group.
Nico Selle of TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know the students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be useful as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that there is such an open term to fight for students.
"Other ways, it was more of a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for recent graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long crowds of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try and try to attract particularly highly skilled workforce.
Especially graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German VDI engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will continue to grow.
Roman Dykta goes to the auditing and consulting firm KPMG for talent.
It organizes demanding Recruit-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants have to find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students in the United States next year.
Participants can also view KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
He will decide in advance in two selection rounds, who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many people will fly to the USA.
In the battle for High Potentials at universities, increasingly harsh laws will apply, according to Dykta.
"We want to be different from our Race with our race."
"A simple trip to the sailboat was too little for us."
The talent hunter seems to be lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year."
“Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for work,” he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies are classically presented in the labour markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As for example, Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of the personnel department of the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
Currently, there are 35 positions on the company's website.
"Currently, it's just difficult to fill vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors report that it is possible to do a practice or write a thesis."
A solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
“Big groups often can’t offer it,” says Stübe, head of the personal department.
In the search for work, money does not play a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, babysitting or good course of action are other crucial factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study of Great Place to Work.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, co-workers are asked how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitor the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the personal department Stübe hopes that the placement will bring her points for those interested in their jobs.
"I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about the external assessments of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means primarily internal action.
“The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer leads through its own employees,” he says.
This is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the enforcement of an employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise on their own to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"That's like a string game," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil wells
New oil drills will not be built in the next few years before the coast of the U.S. Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus definitively canceled earlier plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new wells are banned.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar said this on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees lives and led to the biggest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to pressure the opposition and industry, to allow new wells in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clear to explain who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the bay.
The center of the criticism is the British energetic BP Group, which is confronted by billions of dollars of applications.
The commission commissioned by Obama should present the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the ban on drilling that was in effect from the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies filed applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent such a catastrophe by stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At the moment, the audit office is being reformed, drawing attention to himself with many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish the lucrative options for tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil mined in the bay.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brakes on the growth of the gas and oil industries,” is the result of the current survey by BDO consultancy – even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is also complaining about uncertainty in the industry: “Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investments in new mining projects are moving up until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it stinks like a pump: billions of liters of leaked oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on stealing, corrupting and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," says an environmental activist: "Today, you're going to get enough oil mud in front of your lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy who wades on his breast with water, surrounded by smudges: the scene looks almost nice in the water gloss with rainbow colors.
The fact that brown oil clots float under the surface is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough garments in her vessels, Esther Badom says on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge heat-free area from the broken line.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get into the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst-infested areas in the world.
On the way down the river with many side tributaries, the entire range of the trigger is only noticeable.
The engine on the boat cooks brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever immerses their hand in water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black sticks of licorice, rarely occurring palms let their leaves hang sadly.
In vain we look for flocks of birds that normally occur in humid areas: As soon as the motor on the boat ceases, it breaks down in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a scary silence.
“What happens here is the ecological conduct of the war,” Celestine Akpobari says sadly: “We live in constant fear for health.”
Comparisons with the war are justified.
The area of settlement of Ogoni is a battlefield where fighting has been fought for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe crowded here, where the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Salo-Wiwa was formed in the 1980s, here Shell had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for the employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire area of the adult is mined by the triple-sized Switzerland with more than 5000 mining wells and 7000 kilometers of power lines of more than two million barrels of black gold, lies the oil field in the Ogoni falloe area, for the concern the situation is very unstable.
Every several hundred meters rise from the water of the steel structure as bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so are too tenderly called the heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most rusty to the core.
Every now and then, such a head of the drilling hole breaks, tells Akpobari, and then a constant flow of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have flowed into the delt ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil leaked into the sea by Alaska in the crash of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell refers to sabotage and organized oil theft worth more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists refer to cracking heads of wells and leaky lines as the root cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, the group accuses the US-American scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the number of faults on the management is said to be "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-staminated open-air workshop, a figure emerges from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by leadership, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
The oil has been warming up in the barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group leader.
First, gasoline from the lead into the pickup pot, later dripping at the end of the kerosene line and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four collaborators make up to four barrels of 300 liters per day: "We're going to earn 34,000 Naira" - around $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of a chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-state of black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents of euros per litre of diesel can still be beatn by illegal manufacturers: because they have raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, the entire Niger Delta region is lost to the country daily at least 16 million liters of oil.
But only a negligibly small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking representatives of the military, into tankers and selling it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the people caused the disaster and their interventions or the lax method of production is considered purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If oil companies hadn't considered themselves to be intruders, and if they hadn't so perfectly destroyed the life nature of fishermen, then there would be neither sabotage nor theft and the illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship primarily to Shell is so damaged that only the group’s departure is considered: “Perhaps other nations like the Chinese will turn out better.”
Michael is disturbed.
"High time to get away," says the muscular manufacturer.
"Soldiers can come at any moment."
If a special military unit found them, they would not be in jail, but a painful bribery.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This cursed thing has brought our country to the bottom in all respects," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction bug in A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety glitch.
Investigators found a possible construction flaw during the inspection of the machine that had made an emergency landing, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas airbus passengers were probably more fortunate at the emergency landing at the beginning of November than it was known so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety defect on the engines of some A380s during its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction mistake.
Perhaps a glitch would have severe consequences: cracks could arise on one oil connection due to wear and tear, according to an ATSB statement published this Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a ruling for the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, the parts were released and they damaged the load-bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce described the damage to burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
Security shortages were considered important enough to all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine as a safety measure for one A380.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall will cause chaos in traffic
Germany in white: it was snowing in almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, train connections and planes are being cut.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing Germany: almost the entire republic fell into place on Thursday night at freezing snow temperatures - leading in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east, up to 15 centimeters of snow lies in some places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still deployed, but it could not handle the newly blowing snow.
There was also a strong gusty wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a stormy toll with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic Sea coast in Schlesvik-Holstein in the morning.
Snow drifts caused significant problems in Saxony on motorways and state roads.
According to the center of bad weather Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxon Switzerland, the level of alarm was on the violet - the highest ever level.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, strong and fresh winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and passenger cars were left there at night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities also reported major road problems.
On the A2 caused slow traffic and congestion.
There was trouble in Thuringia because of the snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, it is occurring from major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, the overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and switches.
In Saxony, remote traffic had to be stopped from Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In the Thunderyn Basalfeld, he had to stop one ICE to Munich.
165 passengers received woolen blankets, food and drink on the train from firefighters and rescuers.
The snowwinds were blowing across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, annulled flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt, a spokeswoman for Fraport, 40 flights have been cancelled, according to Fraport.
Road maintenance is in constant commitment.
Although there are few unconnected passengers at the airport, 400 field beds are prepared for them.
There have been accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, one driver of a truck died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: there was also a truck at a railway crossing because the vehicle was stranded.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning hours.
And one 30-year-old woman died after she flipped over on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg with her car.
Meteorologists, however, have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even with light gusts of wind.
But the wind is weakening.
Only by the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds with the force of the gales.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looking for a buyer for tower-twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper paper, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could earn up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters of the group: tower-twins in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, bankers were once again allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now, apparently, the financial group wants the costs of refurbishment back again - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as reported by the "Financial Times Deutschland" with reference to the spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
“We are still investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell the property and then rent it again,” he said.
With this, the largest credit institute in Germany is again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank took over the tower-twins only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors of its own fund and subsequently refurbid them expensively.
Energy rebuilding swallowed about 200 million euros, according to the data.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the previously renamed towers to "Greentowers" to a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the fund's assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It has still not been possible to rescue the dead because the security situation in the shaft continues to be complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were overthrown in the mine.
The shaft where the accident occurred was a solar-scano, but it did not discover any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue powers could not descend due to safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
It still failed to free the dead.
Now the remembrance of the dead have been honored by relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, ten thousand people gathered in sunny weather.
They were quiet for two minutes.
On the tribute of the memory of the buried miners were built 29 tables, on them helmets, lamps and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal belongings, like clothes and surfboards, have found their place here.
On government government buildings, flags flew at half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would once again come out of the "deep of the country" to the surface, New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swamped in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also participated in the commemorative event.
During the explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also swamful.
Rescuers began by extinguishing the fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As the poisonous gases dissolve, it begins to cool the high temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Is the horror to the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is attempting to climb the old borders with his "Walhalla Rising" battle epic.
What did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his adversaries in a great way with almost supernatural strength - it sounds ideal for young men's spectators who are looking for bloody actions, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and his enemies even fighting even the insides of the belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-eyed, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters say at most one or two sentences, or let themselves be drawn to the painful dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and reveling in the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts interested in existentialism and very calm camera footage.
It's good when a movie has multiple target groups, it's just a shame when they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher," is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically prevents him from approaching his works either by more mainstream humor or less brutality to an artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema are apparently discouraged by the everywhere spray-squirting brain and innards.
Supporters of action films will be bored at the latest when One-eyed goes to Jerusalem for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of ships and will remain hanging forever in the windlessness and fog before the men apparently reach America and continues to remain silent there.
So it is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not get into cinemas in Germany and has now been released only on DVD.
It is a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes even the twisted blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or an accurate plot, everything is the atmosphere, the fevered dream that has become a film.
And that's not for the spectator of escape.
Refn doesn't give him a moment of release and slowly suffocates him with his chilling footage and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all with an indescribable hatred that flows from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps the Ones will keep something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Of all, the most one-eyed hero, whose motives will never be explained, who will become a time for enemies and a transient ally a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It portrays destruction, but perhaps also only for the wicked ones.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
The experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has new warnings about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting statements - nor will it allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets will attack the mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the bank of Euphrat; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Nuclear Energy Authority (IAEA), its name appears when it is a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Based on the communications of the USU. foreign CIA intelligence service at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technique of the 1950s is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, it clarified where any components of the reactor before destruction could be, it is intended to be a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were still presented photos that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than then, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Earlary US President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memory that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence intelligence correspondents in Europe are even more cautious and only talk about a "alleged reactor," even though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "worthy."
They lack clear evidence, as do the IEA.
When asked how confident he was having a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in the summer, the IAEA said to have "enough material to ask questions."
The rubble allegedly "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Still, in June 2008, the IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar found traces of uranium made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photos of commercial vendors from just after the attack, which should be more apt than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these footage is not on the market because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - maybe Israel.
The IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program and did not even build a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after the analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, he banned the inspectors from the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
“We will never comment,” Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently confirmed the official position at the time.
The investigation of this case has been going on to the end of June 2008 and "increasing into a serious problem given the credibility of the office," as the senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - a serious violation of the nuclear ban agreement, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers the other three devices to be a key to advancement to the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
The inspectors have not yet stated which devices they are either, nor what function they have or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayh, derived again by nearby cities.
An independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these objects and found a complex of buildings in satellite images that is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, Syria denies access to these three places.
In Vienna, it was said that Syrians were afraid of fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be pre-selected by the US to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has data and satellite images that material was transported back and forth between these three places and the square of Euphrat.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one device should be "in connection with fuel production."
But there are no "no evidence of sensible activities", i.e. uranium enrichment and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where the plutonium should be split from it later, there are only probable estimates for these central issues.
It is also not known whether debris that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of cargo cars had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to have information about the rubble has gone.
Only a few kilometers from the el-Kibar far away and on the other side of Euhrat, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had Syria inspected in 1998 as a suitable storage for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Earlier IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put him in connection with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for inspectors to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows how much the interest of the inspectors is.
Damascus, meanwhile, also rejected this proposal.
If a year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the matter was not burning, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections for several months, one of the hardest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce the controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken about the "possibility to which I am inclination in the future" but is still hesitant.
This choice poses a big risk: On the one hand, the majority in the IAEA Gonnarear is needed for this, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What happens if they don't find anything after all?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on a still nameless directorial first novel in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote the script herself, a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but even this causes restlessness.
There is a perpetuation that the woman, who is Muslim, falls in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
In the meantime, the film has finished in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of the Women's Victims wrote through the UN-organizations to help UNHCR Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UN-organization to help refugees.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a week ago to meet in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the campsites where the rapes were raped, love stories did not take place, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals enough of the script.
Her organization has therefore recommended the UN-organization to help refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What scenes exactly did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received its script to read, allowed filming after minor tussles in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasizes that she does not pursue any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself to the conflict in Yugoslavia with great efforts, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film circulating on the Internet, which sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the start of the war and meet again when she, like a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds different from "the victim of rape falls in love with his tormentor."
The fact that Jolie really begins before the war is true.
Jolie argues that she is under pressure, which is "not fair and based on erroneous information."
Now they can free them from Hollywood: By posting illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but away
This evening is good for the Irish again.
Not a clue after grief.
The home team dominates very much above its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream with joy to the sound of loud music, stomp their feet.
Bailey-Pub in Cork, South Africa, boils down because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and hit.
The "Beer Pong" is called the bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and a ticket to Las Vegas for the World Championships in beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shouted beer game and restrained computer scientist, it doesn't match much.
Still, a 26-year-old man tries to entertain himself, to unwind from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a play passion in Las Vegas, he is going to an interview for New Zealand in January.
"I have a weird feeling about it," he says.
"It's that far away, and I don't have a job there yet."
Still, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of the three Tanner siblings have already tried to be happy abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT-advisor in London.
Boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the foreseeable future, predicting experts from the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of ESRI in Dublin.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the forecasts are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration as the suffering of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise, which has brought great prosperity to the Irish, the dismality is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is mainly intensifying the young, educated Irish, who have so far experienced only the rise.
Loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in these years of boom.
Everyone was needed, there was money to spare.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are unemployed.
There are many letters in the Irish Times to readers who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he's gone and our country is losing a whole generation."
"Please turn off the last one."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black, because the government is only deceiting and offering no prospects for young people for the future.
“They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates get away from one unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnn try to see the topic positively.
McLarnnov organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers an overall service on the topic of work abroad.
“For beginners in the labor market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboard skiers in Canada.
The news is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Seán O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to repay the house loan at home.
“Sometimes the situation is really a bit crazy,” she says, crossing the threshold of your own house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in at all."
He laughs astray and walks cold rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, large expensive cars parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent funded by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, the simple money was without many questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it might not go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, he's going to have hot tea, and he says, "I don't have children to feed on and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
A civil engineer doesn't like the clench he's heard so often.
“No one has to starve – our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island,” he says.
"Working abroad for a while, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back again, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep your future open and simply wait to see how life develops elsewhere.
He has also been in a few years of work in London, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might throw herself into a bachelor party.
"Above all, no emotion," he says, drinking beer properly.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Crime is more concerned than unemployment.
And Brazil sees many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarómetra survey, which was held in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
Two related items dominate in this year’s survey, which took place in September and early October.
The first is that Latin America is in a fairly cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, democracy support has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew up in Mexico, where economics was recovering after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which is withdrawing the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a big increase (graf 3).
Roughly 34% said they trusted the Diet in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
The support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latino-borne people living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
But the mood varies in a wide range from country to ground (see Graph 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rareer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
For the second time since surveys began to be conducted, more respondents across Latin America see the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives were the victim of a crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to an figure of 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private entrepreneurship and market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, this percentage increased from 56% of 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has grown from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez expropriate many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has a leader in the area, as 19% of respondents mentioned (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The election meant filling urns and repetitive voting, ballots scattered across the canals, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many of them moved because of the January earthquake, were roaming around trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several anticipated outliners, shouted that it was a scam and called for the election to be canceled.
The protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said it was "a pretty good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community cautiously said that they "do not believe that these discrepancies, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, an unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive duel is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn from their original call to be declared null and void.
But the problem may arise if Mr Celeststin, who has little or negligible support among voters, will be identified by the Electoral Commission for achieving a decisive duel.
Due to the rampaging epidemic cholera and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
Roughly 250 thousand identity cards that are necessary for the vote remained undivided shortly before the election.
He's at stake a lot.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
After tiptoe to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly widowed, is benefiting from public sympathy, with her popularity boosting from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet the conversion of this success into a successful campaign for the second term of next year's elections may depend on whether the grieving Mrs. Fernández gives up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these characters everything will be established.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of compiling budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
The government of Mrs Fernández lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split up and was further destabilized at the death of Mr Kirchner on a heart attack on 27. October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (which were slapping and accusations of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to fight," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, with the president having more space to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth of up to 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11 per cent, but many private estimates and trade unionists are talking about a figure approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by the economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and purged INDEC, a statistical agency that agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private businesses and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation disrupted growth based on the big devaluation in 2002.
This may be why Madam President Fernández shows that she wants to restore Argentina’s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government formed an agreement with bondholders who previously rejected a debt restructuring that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now President Fernández is facing an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped at the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact not be in sight of the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index, which will commemorates the introduction to INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether Madam President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get support for the middle class, which is tired of Kirchnerism.
At the time of the Argentine's return from their summer vacation, which they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win the next election, she will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to quietly renounce the many of the views her husband held in politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to closer connections to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think about her big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on November 27 mayors and the city council in five city districts, which can be seen as a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevails in the mainland and have a strong commitment in business relations, including a partially free trade agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his party, Kuomintang (KMT), ended with a win of three of the mayor's five offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to Taiwan's greater independence, won nearly 50% of all the votes against the KMT 45%.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the proportion of his party's votes has been reduced by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with the KMT in the city councils.
The election took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy electoral trucks and mass rallies with flags with suffocating girls.
It even included a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, the honorary chairman of the KMT, was agitated for the candidates of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, injures him and killed the spectator.
It was not bizarrely determined whether the militant intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims that the shooting has affected the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates struggled over plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also abandoned the arousing of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to reality and the realization that Chinese trade is crucial for Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma confirmed on behalf of his party that China's policies are acceptable to most Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It would be better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP party discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and a proponent of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation has evolved, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was proclaimed as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-changem, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai informs the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trustful alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems to be angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight for the selection among potential candidates.
KMT is eligible to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's ratings were wrong, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go into the campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gaps between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says he will reorganise his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has passed."
Grammy Award nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
The speech at the request of the president and the people must inevitably notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, she is described as one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in accordance with the rules of the Grammy, when the artist is not allowed to release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album, the "Chamber Music Society," has certainly taken a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success recorded by Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammys voting for a similar jazz work in this category in years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing album ride that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley "Positotly."
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge of steampunk has gained several well-served recognitions in the category of large ensembles, with the competition being the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how the bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
At the 53rd annual Grammy Awards, nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an alcolic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with custody on Southern California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance at the award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was awarded to Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and its "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" listing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre.
Composers who are nominated for the Grammys for Contemporary Compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatament Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
The 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with an orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he had written a 15-minute work specifically for the Mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for the leadership of the Chicago Symphony in recording the works of Stravinsky.
The instrumental soloists who received the nomination include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominees of the vocal soloists this year were only women, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition classics, soprano Jessye Norman won the nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mosque in Temecula receives approval of planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project for promoting terrorism and would lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in accordance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, who you will remember," said Snake Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means that justice will always prevail."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against only shout loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
Negotiations began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time was discussed with people who were pros or against the center. These voices were evenly distributed, gives Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one commentary appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temicula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmouh condemned the violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families had been living in Riverside County for years without an incident, but wished for a larger and more suitable space than the warehouse space he rented together with the manufacturer of filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should take up space with 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council regarding the project.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space to find new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that this is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered and fundamental.
"This organism has two abilities."
"It can grow either thanks to phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that this is a form of truly ‘extraterrestrial’ life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, six main elements were considered necessary for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfuria.
However, scientists have discovered that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You'll be amazed at what else is possible," Ariel D said. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for finding life outside the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on the news published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the find, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "it shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, the Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockello was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with an element of another in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic.
Arzene and phosphorus are chemically similar elements, so she considered that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, may be able to replace one for another.
"Arzen is poisonous mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms can be very difficult to separate these elements."
"However, arsenic is so different that just as phosphorus does not work. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists gather bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic that bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better with phosphorus action, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or month where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a microbiology assistant professor at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic that could be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but there was never an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arzen was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it may have been exploited by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early period of the Earth," Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simona research team, said in a statement.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The other two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found. This was reported by the Los Angeles region sheriff on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akities and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the motel Bellflower 6, the authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were discovered on Wednesday late in the evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles area.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, as well as did not share detailed information about finding them.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not found to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two acumess were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found a bathtub and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace and 10-month-old female Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undisclosed until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to attend the AKC/Eucanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop at nearly months of steam travel around dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard signed up for a motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs with them - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brazilian's hound - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akities and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car, where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had plenty of fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6am on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
The Lion is again ready to roar now that the restructuring of MGM receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of tremors and uncertainty, MGM was finally given the green light to start again.
Federal Insolvency Justice New York City Officially Blessed the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors on Thursday to settle about $5 billion in debt to clear the path for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy rules, MGMs do not remain legal obstacles to rebuild Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the slimmed studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance new operations and productions.
It is now a merger with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million and is expected to be financed around mid-december.
The restructuring process of study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert known for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve the MGM financial difficulties and 140 studio lenders took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company for sale at the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion, plus the funds demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Coopera will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million payment.
Cooper's firms, which collect $375 000 a month for their services, which manage the company's running, will receive a $4 million reward for success.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to renew production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the financing of two films, the basis of which will be the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its stake in the two films that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, sought the possibility of merging his studies with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your budget for gifts in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, this is a significant impact on the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX wheels for $99, and one game Kinect costs the same as 10 beaded skipping ropes or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your budget in balance for gifts.
I recently visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; this year's technology toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys have emerged with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, it offers more.
The number of toys with button batteries increases, as well as toys with battery rechargeable.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases that are marked differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their tummy.
At one press, the animal emits the tone and the other press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Caution: Once you start squatting, you can't stop.
The best choice in a combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animart doll on Elmo Live Technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk monthly thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
Children test the Mickey Dance Instructor toy, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a kid of the 80's, you might remember Alphia, one of the first computer learning toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn the car into a fun with working with an autopsy, witty workbook.
If you're squining for your baby on your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although games do not have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change of the Leapfrog Leapster series, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
The iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has a slot on an SD card that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than a matchbox, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before it runs out; it's great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two toys Webkinz and Club Penguin were represented in the toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years of age), which contains a hidden code coin.
When you activate the code online, your child receives enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include roller skates or a Puffle animal.
Smother larger than the bristles of your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years), the latest in the range of microrobots on the button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in accidental direction.
It's fun when you make a maze out of dice and watch to find a way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off with the kitchen table and even spend some time in the muzzle of our dog.
Introduction of a fineer police control in China
As an urban military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlled his orders and issued orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members - Chinese sturdy enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their hard interventions and lobbies in violence - to convey a certain impression on a cluster of ascensions.
"Close yourself straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what nice girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood on top.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as if according to the ruler.
The four headgear fits perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang disdainfully.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of urban guards in China.
One city ordered the new conscripts to have a university degree.
Guangdong's province has changed gray-green uniforms to a more attractive blue.
In central China, Wuhan replaced the staring gazes for the powerful armament: in 2009, one report stated that 50 officers encirculated the cart with snacks unyielding and stared at the owner until the door-to-door dealer packed up and drove away after half an hour.
Xindu, the city district with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its municipal police with 13 women who have been selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetricality and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, the finer, female party.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city ordinance, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat the uninvolved viewer to death after using his cell phone to shoot how they were involved in the crackdown on the protest against the landfill.
Last year, the training of police officers in Beijing took place, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the offenders without signs of blood.
This year, a door-to-door melon dealer in Shanghai got into a brawl with five police officers and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, depicts Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, lamentsed last year after further discussion about tactics.
On paper, there was "really thoroughly cleansing."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the county advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, the editorial of The Beijing Evening News dealt with the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are merely distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The county demanded female contenders between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "the feat features in the right proportions."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Retired at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the work is mentally too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as if government websites.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine the next, include height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have different responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city management, does not agree with this description much.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the question of good appearance is a subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disabled or maiming will certainly not be used.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked person to serve with us," said Mr Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who holds a patrol in Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist character, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her collaborator with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They do not object to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just to drive traders into the aisles where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers running around on foot or on wheels trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu before they are expelled.
"Mrs. Wong, you have to leave."
"We've told you that many times!" said Miss Xu when the marketer began to run, and for a time he left his bike with a noodle cart.
Police describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
"Every day is basically the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies her freelance marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female policewomen do not have powers as their male counterparts so that the sellers can seize the goods.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's capital, rebelled after false rumors spread that police officers had killed the seller.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers had a patrol that morning, gathered more than 50 people on the street's corner.
Police seized a motorcycle that was repaired on the pavement instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute distance in front of the police officers, looking angrily, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, coordinator incorporated into the men's group, stayed at the back, his white bade turned to hide his name.
Like female policewomen, coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr Li matter-wise.
"Mostly it's the public that's going to start it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with his former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican Republic, has faced and which until the time of the scandal was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair has come into national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" by the decision that followed nearly a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate's ethics committee.
Lawyers by Mr. Ensign said that the Justice Department "up informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there is no plan to bring further allegations against him on the matter."
The Department of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department, who claimed there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents released in October 2009 in the New York Times said that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and support their views after employing Mr. Hampton to lobby him for them, stating so many documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently an assistant to Mr. Ensign, he was expelled from lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, has emerged in violation of the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that was released, "it emerged that this is a clear case of preparing a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients being investigated by the government.
While officials from the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasons for Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specializing in ethics said the ministry was cautious about political lawsuits, after a large number of setbacks, including last year's decision to suspend a lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens in the midst of charges of misconduct by the prosecutor's office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a law firm in Washington who filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign.
"It basically shows that high-ranking government officials don't apply to the law," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he was called by the State of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and he told him that the ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in Wednesday's statement, "he acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he handed over to prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable at reviewing the details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt the investigation into a separate complaint in which the ethics group filed allegations that the payment of Ensigno's parents to Hamptons in the amount of $96,000 violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it had insufficient evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work, NV Energy, the main non-Dadwise company that has long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 proved that after Mr. Hampton started working at the company as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's executive - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him he was "bugging" into the Interior Ministry regarding the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr Hampton and another non-Dadwice client, Allegiant Air, and called on the transport minister to make an appointment on behalf of the airline after they hire Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he plans to participate in the Senate for a third term.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of investigating the crime of his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the non-Hava people," she said.
Cheshire's call is turning to Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom, half a dozen of them wrote.
A minute later, they sent news of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says that more than 140 000 messages on Twitter were dealt with the rape and tie of children to the beds in the house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, a trial of Steven J. Hayese, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and was to be held officially ending with the imposition of the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed an appeal to the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely have for years to employ.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by the main reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then introduced the jury in the sense of influencing the public's opinion.
This claim could be made by the judge to address the question of whether to require new rules in the courtroom with the advent of new technologies.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for the individual," JJ said in a statement. Ullmann, Chief Defense Attorney of Mr. Hayes.
Judge of the trial Jon C. The Blue High Court of the state briefly rejected the claims concerning last week's decree and that the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to indicate that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have acknowledged that reporting of notorious cases could raise questions about the justice process.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court annulled the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sheppard herself, for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the trial was a "carnival atmosphere" because of the media.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration of the TV show and the movie "Full".
Some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal, which reviewed Hayes's verdict half a century later, could be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courtrooms, which was in the case of the Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in high-profile cases, John J. said. Donhohue III, a professor of law Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was performed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be taken afrogate that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is only one of many outlined lawyers, Mr. Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
Defense attorneys say, for example, that Mr Hayes' case may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential judges by showing them criminal photos chasing horrors when choosing a jury.
Some of the judges said they were horrified by photos of the victims Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed the juror who was critical of the prosecutors and that his decision had wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think at the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the influence of the scale of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They stated in an objection to the verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were constantly stirring up the flames of emotion in the matter of the case.
"A daytime rush of media, cameras and reporters in court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and it may also be a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the talks, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outragous than the reports given later, and from their point of view, the judicial police should direct the field of action of further trials.
But some lawyers demanded appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require the adjustment of the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers seek this right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the 1966 Supreme Court in the case of the judgment of Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process, wanted to clarify the demand that the new media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus the 21st century Maxwell."
Can politeness to cross the abyss?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its insult and negativism, a small amount of courtesy appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of a real cooperation of two political parties or only an illusive moment before the rapid return to the party fight in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and parliamentary leaders made no major discoveries on the essential issues that need to be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion of two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built mutual respect, which goes beyond the ideological divide that still divides the members.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period - they probe with each other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience towards the renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's hearing and its later evaluation by the participants were also carried out with a minimum of demands or accusing.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too extensive and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the circumstances that have prevailed here for the last two years.
Whether it is the issue of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"The question is not whether the regulatory issue has changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The election aroused the emotions of the party members, and then they died down.
It's good."
On a few issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expired at the end of the year, and no one thinks it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits just because Republicans can't look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy while they're refusing unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already more optimism about a possible deal on these issues, along with the ratification of the new inaugural treaty.
But William Galston of Brookings In point out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes for January.
Rather, the likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that need to be done, psychology returns to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the voters of tea parties who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, they know they have to behave according to their promises and have to cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These adherentlines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, increasing pensions and spending reductions.
Joint-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are meant, in their opinion, to put pressure on the issue of the deficit to the public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee so that they can present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials on the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial issues, at least today, we have small foundations or the will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between the White House and the Republican Party.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to resolve budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What will the shift cause?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the party at the last election, a majority of Americans want to continue to see two parties that work with each other.
If it could be directed towards a stalemate, as was the case in 1995, then both sides will closely monitor the public's reactions.
Anyone will face a reduction in votes, they will probably change the course and look for a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
Today, the party and direction are greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a greater ideological divide between Obama and parliamentary Republicans has emerged than it did in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to a more important election in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost many efforts on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
U.S. documentary depicts Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city's management is in the hands of the "kleptoracie" and it continues with part of bribes and bribes for protection that come on their way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from lawful shops, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of the office" - will take its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The entry, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The footage was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of much involvement in corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedem, but since then we can only watch minimal changes in purification.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have been constantly abducting corruption charges for many years, and has won several lawsuits for perjury for such allegations.
In September, he said on a Russian television station when he was asked about the proven testimony of corruption: "It's crazy, it's filth, it's rubbish."
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will show up at the vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details uttered in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unexperienced that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its association with criminal elements some have led to call it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government works more like a kleptocracy than as a government," the report said.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'crysh' (the term from the world of prison and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection, provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Attorney, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified and a three-degree structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on top of the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are at the second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill in void places in some areas, as the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB takes money from the largest firms and the police focus on smaller businesses.
One source said, "owners of shops in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Home Office (preferably than from organized criminal groups), as they have only no more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"Therefore, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, protection alone can already have difficulties; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay quickly enough, their shops close under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably packed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Indem.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that the nationally cost Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (they are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the report of the U.S. Embassy, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening, certainly did not elicit in the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be charged for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be the possibility for the Kremlin to argue about solving the problem.
Speaking to CNN with Larry King, Putin said that documents that WikiLeaks published may have been fakes and responded angrily to a statement that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedea Robin.
"The truth about the whole issue is that it is our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such coercion, you understand, so unethically."
Khmer veterans are forced to cope with the past
In a sparmly lit concrete classroom with soiled and peeled walls, the headmaster of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves that Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "stone" for its brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this distant Khmer Rouge hold in the northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of this organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge has given up the government, long-lasting loyalty is also broken in Anlong Vengo.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reainforcements Forum were allowed to publicly confront the people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the UN and Cambodian court jointly make a first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the verdict of the former leader, the notorious rapist association Tuol Sling, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such progress, the unrest among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts to reconcile and their attempts to re-enter the Cambodian society.
"There is grudge and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are helpless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Kambodzi dokument-aviding center, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge administration in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starvation, sick or overworked.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Polish Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara were driving partisan wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Vengo.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to the government, culminating in the Ieng Sara surrender in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samhanha in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and the Mok, who persevered, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby mountains of Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penhski's prison in 2006 while waiting for a trial.
Their patrons no longer took care of them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into ordinary Cambodian country life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefits from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Center, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised without any idea of making a deal."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengo before he settled as a poor farmer in 1998.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"That Mok feeds everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we have to secure everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Court has also raised concerns.
Earlier this year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leaders and people responsible for crimes, but it was not said whether it would also continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the fears in Anlong Vengu.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that was likely to kill thousands of forced workers.
A recent hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field to his wooden house on a dirty journey outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the arid grasses, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are further prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court seeks out more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Kamboja must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is only what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"The reconciliation in Khmer conditions means the bonding of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center has published the first textbook approved by the Khmer Rouge government, it has 75 pages and the title "The History of the Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Vengu in June as an addition to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties about the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vong also knew few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They are suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and more difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have influence, he further said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a strong charm.
Up in the Dangrok Mountains, the path is overgrown with weeds and dumped with discarded plastic bags that leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
The body of Pol Poto was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated in that place.
"But he has a strong spirit, many locals walk here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea was her birthday and was planning to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing her luck.
Belarus agrees to see its uranium-based weapons stocks
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was published in a joint statement issued after the security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has tried to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have encountered a stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a couple of classified operations had been conducted with Belarus in the last two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the remnant of the material - approximately £500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The deal turned out to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the summit on nuclear security2012."
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security group.
Clinton called the deal "a very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all its reserves of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our commodity...We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone either."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus a few months ago acceded to the United States and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irraised, officials reported.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to Russian facility for storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it to deliver less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of confidence," which led to a deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy working for the Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for Numetal Non-Proliferation Studies this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for the production of weapons.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will seek the removal of its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's cruel human rights repression.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and it is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
Spanish government didn't make expensive CIA flights
The Spanish government has not made expensives about CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and members of Al-Qaid to Guantanamo via Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to El País, where it also states that Prime Minister María’s first deputy, Teresa Fernández de la Veg, asked that the Spanish executive be informed and “could show that she has the appropriate surveillance of foreign planes flying through the Spanish airspace”.
In June 2006, following a communication by the Council of Europe, in which a dozen states, including Spain, were charged with human rights violations, a meeting was held between U.S. Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Veg.
The prime minister's deputy said the Council of Europe's communication "exits out of Zapater's government" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide on the matter.
De la Veg stressed that Spain has no problem with flights of the secret services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "disabled unprepared," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "want to give this matter the lowest possible outlines, but by the fact that this case was in the hands of judges, the Cabinet had limited opportunities for influence."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, in the case of his, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to seek the deletion of documents from the National Center of Intelligence (CNI) and the Department of Defense regarding CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated component or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern more because of the "apparent coordination between a Spanish judge and German prosecutors" than to declassify CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to deal with this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on lunchtime with U.S. Ambassador and Home Secretary Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, the ambassador said that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they would consider appropriate," he already commissioned to his co-workers, "may they avoid the heated comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party) on this matter.
“Over despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that Zapater’s government tolerated or intentionally ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government,” he notes.
Confessed mother-male complained on the net on the mother's "worry"
A young woman was talking about a baby when she was already dead and had her blog: "Terror after Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she had used since she was a young age, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both of them are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, from which the young woman comes from.
The news is from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which the ABC newspaper reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon found a new agility.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Louisame.
Their cohabitation took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma for a week.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone on Menorka and writes: "Alberto is some kind of angry that I have gone to work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just got: "I'm going to come back this month or give me an address where to send you a baby."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going there this week, but I'll only stay until 19, because 20. I have to go for work so I don't lose that place."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son to himself.
“He’ll be with who he’s supposed to be with, that is, with me, and it’s never going to happen again that I’ve left him with someone else but my mother,” a questionable intention given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When he tapped out this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on 10, is already dead.
"Cesar is, on the one hand, satisfied, but on the other hand he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me, and he likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go there to summer school, so I'll save a little money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you, I don't know what videos to email, look him like he likes, he'll meet me, sex is needed."
Thirty-year-old more news: "The boy is well, he goes to a summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one news about Víctor, the current partner: "He's Giving Me Money."
On the Internet, the Monica's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she was called "Muki Ex-Prisoner."
"Terror after Galician (motto) ".
The last man with whom she lived, the guardian, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penisanship in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center to Menorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how everything happened and "that she did not intend to hurt the little one in some way".
Earlier, however, she admitted that she had drowned César in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are demanding a psychiatric examination.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
with the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main say at the town halls in Lérideo, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes received and the number of experienced deputies during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia) already has a given idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes in nationwide elections is usually one against the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received an 184,091 vote.
If this tendency of increase, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, the analysts of this party have calculated that if the election of the general PPC is held, the PPC could obtain 12 deputies in the Chamber of Deputies compared to the current 8, the CiU party (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Conformity and Union) would also have 4 seats (now)
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is essential for the parties PP and PSOE (Spain Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the People's Party, the ERC (Left-Illuminant Republican Party) would lose one MP - now it has 3 - while the ICV (The Greens Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, or it would win one more.
However, according to the election calendar, the closest reunion will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the socialists' domination in the four major provincial cities, as well as the changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest anticipated budget - the 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérid and Geron, where the socialists would not receive a majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona council - as it is necessary to get at least 5% of the vote.
The PP party has increased the number of votes won in four capital cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérid and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party ahead of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP won only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The People's Party also won other major town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
Currently, PP has representation at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provides thousands of passports to Al-Qaeda
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more in Thailand have been detained
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian who were detained by agents of the General Information Commissory Party in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell run from Thailand that arranged passports for various groups of Al-Qaeda, including "The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ielam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", the latter group killed the assassinations in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aims to ensure the "operation of Kampai" by weakening the counterfeiting apparatus of Al-Qaeda at the international level and "limiting its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that during the two years it was active in Catalonia, the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then counterfeited and then delivered to groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaeda so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active network of jihad in Europe, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that there will be no similar interventions in other European countries in the coming days as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) developed in Thailand in Thailand, while Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan were captured.
It was these men who ran a cell based in Spain from Bangkok and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, mainly stole tourists passports that met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to be valid for several years and be without marked visas.
Investigative documents say that there are not yet known facts that link detainees from Catalonia to the bombing in Mumbai, even though the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was to be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, a transfer agency was sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which were "injected" to buy cards into mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "comanda," which killed 106 people.
Police have already seized a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) demands Maso to halt fiscal deal
Yesterday, the leader of the Party of the People's Party of Catalonia, Alicia Sánchez-Camach, had the opportunity to personally present to Arthur Mas in person the conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration of President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and renunciation of risky businesses such as an economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists wants to propose during his mandate.
The chairwoman of the Catalan People's Party came at a meeting with Arterus Mas with certainty 18 seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is a figure more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formation formations of the opposition to abstaining on his appointment.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists would like to maintain in the Chamber of Deputies when the general elections are held, but so far the talks that are conducting with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the president of PP, in order to gain her support for putting into office, "will have to end all sovereign and liberation speeches," as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque - which the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the thriving political apparatus of autonomous governance and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations regarding Mas's inauguration will be dealt with under the PP party Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Citiadans) and Joan Laporta (Soliaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of the "lack of measures"
The performance of the center Olot does not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric centre of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - was employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
The director of this senior-earth home, Joan Sala, accompanied by a lawyer, the facility's lawyer, Joan Canada, announced that "by wishing La Caritat's home, it would be possible to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for manslease, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the appropriate authorities."
In addition to the reputational damage that the institution may suffer due to the fact that it did not detect the criminal activities of the caregiver in a timely manner, a major threat to La Caritat home now poses demands for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the survivors' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of the clients of the home for the elderly, suspected that in many cases no doctor examined the deceased personally, but that, given the age and poor health of patients, everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat resolutely rejected the extreme through its director yesterday, stressing that "the lack of action could not have been the cause of which it occurred."
La Caritat's attorney added that "there is no indication in the case that any third party commits wrongs except for the defendant's own."
The man, now nicknamed "Angel of Death," admitted 11 deaths yesterday, specifying that he committed his first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, the death caused the administration of too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case when it used a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was complicated to control staff access to medication.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably in six cases out of nine means used by this caregiver to kill patients in their efforts to relieve them of suffering.
However, only the analyses that are now taking place in the laboratory should show whether Vila is not lying and actually looking for a less cruel death for its first victims or, on the contrary, he killed them by serving a lye, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17. October.
At La Caritit, they do not believe in the medic's claims, nor do they rule out that the number of those killed may be higher than he confessed to and justify their behavior in various versions filed by the Villa to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it emerged that he had killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be available to the judiciary to be illuminated the entire scope of this matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Yesterday, investors reacted sharply to yesterday’s threat of the European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to respond”.
The marginal differentials closed with force and European bank shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although there is a decline, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
It will take the investor some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying that it would take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to be recalled for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank has called for an end to the plan to buy the national debt for the ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity levels within a period and to leave unlimited access for only one week.
After the crisis of the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate of forecasts to be "at least until March" and to keep the three-monthly quoting with unrestricted access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least by June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If the expectations created do not meet, this will re-create the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw the degree of liquidity, God with us!
The same was true at the convention in May, where they claimed they didn't even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse in the markets - tomorrow, history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, an armored fist announced this on Monday, and said on Wednesday that it had already purchased many of them, prompting a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday's licitation of bills of one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting the change in the market sentiment that occurred after the words Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures were published represent losses to the Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after it did not detect the problem with stress tests in July, amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get approval of the new budget by parliament and still does not have enough support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has eased the tone of her speech to ease the tensions on her face for the next meeting of EU leaders held on December 14, at which a political compromise is needed to come to a political compromise that would show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while the others would rather Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister yesterday had the opportunity to present a plan of action that will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to recover employment - in the ears of investors this sounds like the Four Seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew by 4.5%, twice as many as other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and persuasive - we probably benefit from the effect of surprises.
Today, we have a key claim for a three-year bond that will be favored by the Trichet effect, which, we hope, will be a great demand for it to help dispel doubts about our refinancing capability.
Asking for a rescue plan would be for Spain to self-selection.
They would give us cash that we don't need - there's 40,000 million cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates, and access to the markets would close sine die to us.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not only to be that, but also to it."
We can do it.
President of the Eulen Group will challenge Vega Sicilia's meeting requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not quiet.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack him after taking him as "completely insignificant", the legal act of El Enebro planned for this 16th month and the required five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to enforce their majority and seize with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia's prosecutor's office.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of part of society.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not seem willing to relax in his dispute over membership in the ruling bodies of the El Enebro group.
five of its seven descendants were deposed from its administration committee, who were named the leaders during the shareholder assembly on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register.
The trial of the El Enebro group, scheduled for the sixteenth month, which was convened by an official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, resumed the thunder in the woemen of the Álvarez family.
The appeal for judges is the only legal means guaranteed by the commission’s convening until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marta and Elvia's Álvarez Mezquirizo is considered by David Álvarez to be "a desperate means of his five children serving with judicial deceit and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the January 18 negotiations, which was completely invalid."
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this act as "completely insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried without success to have the court convened a hearing in June.
In El Enebro, the group, alongside other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% of capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires a use right to 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when drawing the question of the court challenge of the hearing. The date of this trial has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull crashed into Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this newcomer team, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on Ferrari triumph Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the capabilities of the Renault engine, which drives his car, in the world of Formula 1, a legend - a "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull was born in order to make him a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very remote automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software instrument, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for high-precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is realistically created, thereby avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM has made it easier to develop a Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwourm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this software device has enabled the Red Bull team to carry out "within a few hours, in near-real time" modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements over one period.
Today, the Red Bull team works for 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
Siemens leader explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser production systems and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical achievement is the $40 million amount representing the maximum each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a plant of cutting-edge technology to design and manufacture its racing cars, roughly 50 km from London.
These are two buildings that are limited to visitors - especially to journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great secret."
The list of these projects includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is in Formula 1 without a doubt fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the immeasurable technological means that the brand of energy drinks put into its participation in the racing circuits, hides other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey says five years ago it was possible to say that advances in the research and development of vehicles contributed to the victory from 50% and the rest was thanks to the drivers.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology as they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP to set up 20 own stores in two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes yesterday inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This business will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2 that the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores, including PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of the Spanish HP, Helena Herrer, cited as an example the newly rebuilt store in Gran Vía, Barcelona, belonging to Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 sales points in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not want to divin where other stores would be open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrera, who also runs HP personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will still be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises here with the exclusive design of the equipment of stores (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in securing personnel for shops.
Helena Herrerová has denied that it was a franchising, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises when buying, service, after-sales, service and even packaging."
The store in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot pioneering program to address potential problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to the technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes that may otherwise take up to two days."
“This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, given that large companies already have a contractual service of technical assistance,” Helena Herrerová stressed yesterday.
Sabadell bets on "stealing" a million clients to its competitors over three years
More optimistic than other bosses, a delegate member of the Bank's board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a reduction in interest rates, which will try to compensate by discounting bank fees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to raise a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect for three years.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000, if those who eventually leave the bank - because until now the institute pampered small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% in terms of private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or it can also be said soberness, with the aim of reducing costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabedell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although originally it was for three years, but the market situation required expansion for the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the meeting organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficuing and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the road out of the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy".
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create employment," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although he believes that a passive war - which reduces margins - is receding, the price of the risk premiums that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity are already shifting to credit prices, thereby compensating for a reduction in margins.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a coercion factor on loans."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "now is a reduction of commissions" but there is a "competitive framework."
The strategic plan of the Sabadell bank is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not for nothing that in Spain "there will be demanded of larger sizes".
"Next year there will be no stone left on the rock," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "due a lot" and does not exclude that some Spanish institution will enter between the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can substitute the collection of funds in the market ahead of a new measure of capital.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive the temporary closure of markets, it continues to pose a serious problem with what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding using repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of fusions of savings banks
CECA's CEO denied yesterday that another wave of savings-mourd fusions should be created, and again insisted on the speed at which the reorganisation of the sector is being reorganised.
When the Spanish Savings Banks' association process kicked off, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the director-general of the Spanish Confederation of Savellibles (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday ruled out that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered the second round, what is happening to be the conventions."
“Most of them are completely implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the great processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter,” he said.
In his statements at the AREA meeting (Association of Leadership and Executive Officers of Aragon) Olavarieta recounted that the concentration process is taking place at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as it is reported in the instalments that have appeared in the trade plans of the National Bank of Spain at once, not now," he stressed.
“Going from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty,” he underlined.
Olaverite acknowledged that "there is a number of not-so-pleasant views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is reminding us that we must be in time before the end of the year."
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and to those who question this, attribute "lack of knowledge."
The director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as a system that handled the "very important" process of concentration and which continues at the "highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very well out of the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediary agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA (Spain airports and air traffic control), airport manager Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, has joined criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility for the startling of the current crisis.
How to interpret these moves?
It is to say in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here, Germany has a radical new vision of what its future should be, which is alluding to the idea of observing the old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, there is speculation in Germany about three possible trips from the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - although now it may seem sci-fi, this version has the broad support of the public, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is the recast of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigour, fines for guilty states, possible payment delays for some of them, and the expansion of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no room for equakes.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission were fuelling deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform to prevent them from being prevented from 2016.
This was the first sign of the contradiction between what Germany considered right (the plans for fiscal rigor and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country when Merkel was painfully stretching out the decision to save Greece.
It was already a subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear position when she demanded reforming the European Union conventions so as to allow the rescue of a member state and at the same time to have private creditors to be obliged to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in a somewhat mitigated form, has been approved, and over the coming months we should monitor the reform process of the Union, which should allow these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has set a red line that it is not going to cross.
And he tells us all that, although we now need to take measures that they do not seem to agree with, from this date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which states violating the rules will be sanctioned hard and may be forced to report postponing payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany is suggesting that we need to give ourselves a strict path of growth, with an increase in the rate of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
Another option based on receivables and building, with huge gaps in the balance of payments ruled in the years of the growth boom in Spain's growth boom, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not only a resumption of public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want us to do is much harder.
And the worst part is that, under these conditions, it could happen to us that we are mistaken for ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this, and his double statements (reforms promised after the meeting with big businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticisms to Merkel, the path of the idea that things need to be put in order have opened up.
But the red line that Germany has set is here, and it doesn’t seem to want to move it.
And the possibilities that can be considered cannot be excluded from leaving the eurozone full of not very serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumvention of the rules
The tricks, such as Alonso and Ramos in the match with Ajax, show wits, not the intention to escape punishment.
The supposedly orchestrated exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea of ink to be listed about whether this is unsportsmanlike conduct, and whether UEFA should not punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) the appointed players deliberately lost time one by one the moment when the foul was to be played to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, the two players will deliver the prescribed penalty in the following match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending in their group in the lead - and they will be able, deprived of their cards, to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee gave coach Jose Mourinho a penalty for two matches and guilty players were fined in cash.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, that is, rules that are unspeld, but follow.
Part of the discussion in this case arose thanks to the fact that it was the Real Madrid team (which boasts generosity and honor in its anthem, and which has already been fined by its players for similar actions), and it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinho, which thus adds another episode to its long history of the comedian and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of conduct, which is not explicitly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts are circumvented by law; these are indeed actions respecting sporting rules, the meaning of which, however, it seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is addressed what type of damage such conduct acts in the sporting spirit.
One of the essentials of sporting behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents, which has not been violated in these cases, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these essentials characterizing a clean game is to avoid that players, thanks to their offense, have an advantage over the opponent's team - which also did not happen here.
Thus, the paradoxical event of the Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as a lest or circumvention of the law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanction, but this behavior should have been as evident as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited and they were happy to get the punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage the culprits will have of their intentional offense.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that he will not achieve any benefit in the current match, because the evident consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even this is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in that players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage in the long term and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance, the team can be eliminated, and in addition, players will receive a penalty, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which one less card is sufficient to exclude them than in the first round.
So, as the wheels continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions that will allow maximum benefit to be obtained under the rules.
in the case we deal with here, players did not aim to avoid the penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumventing the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusion and because of the way the transmission of instructions to their provocation from the leadership took place.
Damage to sporting principles by these events is not as ethical as aesthetic.
The fight for offers to host Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictate of the calendar concentrates an avalanche of reservations for December 16 and 17.
Celebrations paid for by employees themselves are rapidly increasing, wanting to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, pre-Christmas parties are coming again, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, they have resulted in the fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complication of numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) application for the week from December 13, creating an avalanche of reservations for days at peak days (16th and 17), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, many companies that have abolished collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon traditions, many employees pay to spend at parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of carrying capacity, according to the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurants at the moment does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People think about it before they make a reservation."
"They're going to come out, but when it comes to the subject of prices, they're careful," he adds.
Shops will go well to those "which will offer quality and good service at a favorable price," he says, recalling that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down the bar, and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey at various facilities shows that the biggest onslaught of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most requirements for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adapted to the menus offered, the total prices of which are from 25 to 30 euros.
In another important company, which is Andilana, comprising 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar more early bookings, since the beginning of November.
“We have done possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they say.
In the AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after they have seen earnings increases from the second half of the year and have a fairly solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The resources of this company emphasize that December 18 will also be a busy day, as the pre-Christmas celebrations will be held among friends.
they added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded the tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already appearing to be inviting their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Fecasarm's vice-president (which includes institutions such as the Bar Association, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes it's starting to see the end of the tunnel and claims the number of bookings has "reviated" though clients "gread to the maximum."
This impression did not give up even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has spawned great unease in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a "faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published by Wikileaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that arouses Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to clarifying and significant details offered about the content of communications and ideas of North American diplomats in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is on the decline," and that this volatile Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but are stored in parts to make their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, in a report ahead of the visit of the then national security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the guided missile program is no longer observed only by the US, but also by Russia, as the spreading and presenting reason to be on the lookout.
“Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in education levels and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear programs or guided missile programs,” said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry at a meeting with his US counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation published by Julian Assange's server is the increasingly lower cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on the issues of nuclear weapons propagation and the increased pace of Pakistani weapons production.
A cable issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," he argues: "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, an employee of the national intelligence services for South Asia, states that "even the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world."
Ambassador Petterson is also asking Washington to "grease and explain" during a visit to the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, that "Pakistani army must put an end to the silent support of terrorist groups."
The hunt for the head of the Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking worker responsible for counter-terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" in order to trace and determine where Assange might be.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary challenge," the so-called red notice, to "localize and track the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And he has nothing to do with the latest leakage of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' lawyer Mark Stephens assures that "police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was November 20, when the College of International Police, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, the 188 countries of Interpol have instructions on the identification or localization of Assange "in order to impose a temporary link on him and to issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a red-call person, many Member States, as the organisation explained, see the so-called red notice as allowing the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national component of the police - especially if the states have a mutual agreement on the extradition of detainees, as is the case in Sweden and England, where the Assange should probably be located.
The move scandalized Assenge's attorneys, who published writing yesterday, claiming that the thirty-nine-year-old Wikileaks founder showed a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentii Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal persecution," he statess the letter.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is still in an unfamiliar place, however, he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview from an unknown interview to Time magazine editor-in-chief - in this interview, he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for the order to U.S. diplomats to carry out spying at the United Nations to violate the international conventions that the United States has signed, it should resign,” he said.
His view was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not entirely sure why we should be concerned with the opinion of the individual that runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking worker responsible for counter-terrorism, Rusell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views that are proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress to chair the Committee on National Security in the Lower House since January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute financially or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Even further went to Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who said that Assange should be "killed," which he subsequently had to recall.
"Obama should list a reward or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate, was who didn't apologize.
“Whoever will be in the government, the one who is responsible for the leak of information has committed treason and any other punishment than execution would be too moderate,” he said at Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "winding" on supporter Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote secretly on his remaining.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcecós apparently found a recipe to fight the multiple internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC (Left-Left Republican Party) to the end of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The leader of the party is aware that his gesture regarding the resignation seems insufficient to supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carood-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader, and that he absolutely cannot worry about other defunct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to get new criticisms through wink, which will help him armor himself into municipal elections.
At first, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to secretly speak out on his stay in office.
Using ballots, not by raising your hand.
If Carod's supporters want to give the chairman a penalty of a penalty, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliatory measures.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the shackle and subjugate his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one extra vote, but added, without specifying the percentage that there would also be no good result "after Bulgaria".
Supporters ask the President more to the chairman than to make his position available - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest body at the conventions.
But given that they don’t have enough majority to enforce resignation, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
Because of this, they expect to participate in the elaboration of a document on the strategic reorientation, which the management will give to the National Council on the day 18 of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcecrose in exchange for promising to move the Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that "multi-voicing" harms stability, and that his goal is for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, it seems to be a distinctive article that current adviser Josep Huguet has signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcecós's ideologue, this innovation adviser took the done deal that the leader would be confirmed by "exchange for a few goals."
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is the "recomposition" of the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means also including new faces who are from the sector in favor of Carod.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely put an end to the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes in order to be held by congresses through delegates selected by votes.
Ending the meeting system model, an exception to the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercos's team, which has fought in this direction already at the last two congresses.
However, the 2008 Convulsed Assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on the reforms of the Statutes.
This matter is still unfinished, as the situation within the party discourages from resolving the matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to deal with this issue again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in the month of November; 390 for 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico saw a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, as reported by the daily MILENIO.
Among the murders are the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, a total of 390 killings in Mexico, probably associated with organised crime.
Among the cases stands out the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, in the Toluca district.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a blow from grace to the head and had arms and legs tied to a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the luggage compartment of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlan colony, in the Naucalpan district.
Early in the morning of Thursday, November 4, co-operatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots into the chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway in the section of the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoanaana.
A day later, a fifty-year-old man was murdered in Nezahualcóotl with eight shots, after he came out of his house and wanted to start picking up garbage.
On November 7, two victims were killed by a shot in the head at the age of 30 in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, a dead body shot at the forehead was found on a remote road in El Naranjo, and a shell casing from a caliber was found under the body.
In Ecatepece, parts of the human body were found in the seaswater canal in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue services carried out a thorough search for other parts of it, however, they did not find them.
The residents of Tepotoztlán announced the discovery of the body with their hands tied back and wrapped in head in the place of Pen Colorado.
The man had a blow from a gun to the back of his neck.
mid-month, the murder of two men was reported to bedding in their bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the Atypapán de Zaragoza district, and death-threatening reports were also found in the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the district of Los Reyes La Paz, which contained a human head.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorporegible.
On the 17th time, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning, a man was found in Huixquilucan, wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, who was preliminarily identified by the murderers as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by the killers.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no signs of life with two wounds was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautula.
On the skin of the woman was discovered tattoos tattoos of the sacred stature of Santa Muerte (livery "Holy Holy Death" - note.) and also necklaces with her portrait.
At the end of the month, a man's body with at least third gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepeec in the village of Zinacantepeec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men were found, who had their heads wrapped in tape and there was also a message, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepallaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: "This will happen to those who do not adapt".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found that bore signs of torture and had limbs tied, inside an abandoned taxi outside the Justice Center in the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóothol were found.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancono and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left with a message; while the second was martyred and was found in a plastic envelope on the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, agents found a note with the message.
China Adheres to Its Goal to Reduce Greenhouse Gas
At the UN Climate Change Conference COP16, the country assured that his country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce the carbon footprint, and said he insisted on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN conference on climate change, assured.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he explained that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this issue along with the international community.
He argued that China's strategy on climate change matters was divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and supporting pilot programmes.
On all these points, they have already made progress, which include last year's approval of a new law on energy, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further stressed that in China, federal authorities cooperated in a coordinated manner with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, as he said, various several-year plans have been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is, as he said, the Energy Efficiency Efficiency Program, which has been put in place over the past five years, and which has received investment from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial project of climate change is also running, the project of exchanging fluorescent lamps for energy-saving bulbs and the project of mitigation and adaptation, he clablished.
At the same table, Martin Krol, an expert adviser to this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than widely meant.
For example, he described, greenhouse gas emissions per capita represent 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for a 9% historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects it to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Estabricated by Espin: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional) said that the former chairman of this party is entitled to demand one at the National Order Commission of his right.
The National Chairman of the PAN Party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been enacted, and that the former chairman of this party is entitled to contact the National Order Commission and demand his right.
In an interview that was taken before the objection was raised by the governor of the state, Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espin was in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Riot Commission in Sonoha."
"Mr. Espino has the right to turn in his case through a complaint to the House of Commons Committee to be a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there was now no time to think about 2012, and that she had never been at the negotiating table for the presidency of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on the following 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
“This (a 2012 alliance) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was the intention for the local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
Chairman PAN said that 71 years of dialogue were behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we are benefiting from it and strengthening us," he added.
He said the committee could without a doubt elect the best chairman or chairwoman whom PAN deserves for the next three years, so he would hand over the baton to "homage the committee will appoint".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, to whom I will proudly pass on to the office of party chairman."
He predicted that the rise that the party had recorded in the last election of July would be reflected in future competitions, though "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to accompany the governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxace, Pueble and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and desires are put into them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about critics of President Felipe Calderon a party of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional)) for his speeches within the four years he has ruled, César Nava called on the members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortar.
“If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedil and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderon, let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell,” he said.
He said the head of the federal executive power had the right to express himself as he did during a speech at the National Audition Authority, as neither a gag nor censorship is used in this country.
Obama Promotes Law on Twitter to Support Students Without Documents
“If you believe that the passage of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and ask them to pass this bill,” the US president tweeted.
President Barack Obama joined the National Message to support the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
“If you believe that passing the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and ask them to pass this bill,” Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an internet link to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact senators without delay, as the vote on this bill is approaching.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless an extension of the Bush-era tax cut and government funding is approved.
Such a block-accepting, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could influence the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear weapons proliferation, START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects would be possible.
"I believe there's still plenty of time left..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the matter of taxes before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement on this issue at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would seek "vote to close the discussion" regarding the Dream Act, so the motion to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although more likely to be next week.
The Senatorial approval of the Dream Act, or the "American Dream Act", would legalize about 800 thousand young people who came to the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country over the past five years and have been admitted to the institution of higher education or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, so they need the help of several Republicans, so that the organizations of his supporters are carrying out an intense agitation to ensure the passage of this law.
Democrats, whose majority support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the law.
That's why supporters of the Dream Act need to win several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are most negotiated are Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as Florida's outgoing senator George Lemieux, who supplemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they said they would not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mcain, has yet to comment.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature, they put their finger into the wound ("poner el dedo en la la laga", translated "put finger into the wound" is similar to the Czech "shower nail on the head).
The second round of the cycle Pleasure from the language was a promenade, where participants performed a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in the language, but... Finger to the wound? What awaited me?” asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of the Pleasure of the Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (she explained at another round table at the round table).
The finger into the wound "brings us into the narrow", said the Argentine writer to an audience, composed mostly of young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to listen to this roundtable debate moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Monter and Luis Gar.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text she dedicated to Gonzala Celrio, and which Schultz then described as a great short story in which Luisa appeared in the first person as the protagonist, who, in search of the knowledge of what "war" is going from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers to the answer, although she does not.
The infectologist is leaving the convinced: "patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound".
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the way, but explained to her that the wound was not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it really open and the symbolic one is the scar."
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "only so much she managed to learn about the wound that she was really open and that it did not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasure and pitfalls in the tongue must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
The Nicaragist Sergio Ramírez also came out with an adorable narrative, which he called Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
with the elements of magical realism, she tells of the famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who have gone far away, or corrected the honesty that one virgin had lost, this narrative, which was then turned out to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning there was no lack of his own chroniclers, who told him, and there is a quoted by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the cap.
"Cervantes, who invented all of us, mocked the fake testimonies, which was presented in the stories as real, but in other ways it never managed to tell the story of America with such an imaginativeness that even lacked shame."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and precisely where reality and lies merge, where it is no longer known what of the story belongs to one group and what to the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
He really calls it a "cervant tradition."
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her discussion Finger to the Wound allowed.
The Cuban-portoctor writer pointed with her finger at the great blow of social violence that passes through her country - and shared by Latin America - and is a consequence of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a quiet compromise that, of course, is not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is being made between the author and the readers - and in their "chemical reaction."
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero concluded, whose performance also emphasized "on this finger into the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness, which overflows with dogmatisms, it is forgotten that "behind every nod there is a small one, and behind every denial there is also a small yes."
“To be masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and to color it means many times to put a finger into the wound and to bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black and white, in fixed ideas and without discoloration, and to harass the authorities that prefer this black-and-white world,” said in order to promote the meaning of writing.
Romano goes after his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he experienced both good and bad during his career, but he was already able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
in the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrrey in the final, in addition, two different styles will clash with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to reach the decisive series on three occasions, but until now he left with an unfinished job, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed behind the winner and played curiously with the same team of the following final.
As a coach, the Santist strategist made it to his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament when he had the reins of the Morelia club, with which he succumbed to a total of 4-2 against Toluka; then in the tournament Clausura 2003 again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario 2010, again against the "Divilians" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Snaissaries" (the next nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note.) after 210 minutes of the game indecisively 2-2, after a series of penalty shootings, he got into the advantage of three to one and had two opportunities.
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that the most important thing for him is an institution.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first is the most important," the coach said when he was asked about the numbers that speak in the final against him.
in living memory, he has the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we learned the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out, and I think we have learned in this, until the match ends, we can not celebrate."
It does not concern him that this series could decide in penalty shots, he believes his players: "You never try to come to a series of penalty kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be ready for it, in the last tournament we were ready, but unfortunately fate has prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands,I won't be."
Romano has in his hands the chance to stop being the other and taste the glory they bring for the first time the titles.
The United States is Changing Visa Rules
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centres before the audition at the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the process of discussing visas will change at the Embassy of the United States and Consulates.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services center (abbreviated from ASC English) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will remove the applicant's biometric information and they will be evaluated by the Consular Unit before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to pay a fee for the agreement of the meeting, the second for processing the application and another for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee, which will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases with applications (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for merchants and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but only turn to the nearest ASC, where they submit their papers and fingerprints will be taken away from them.
Since biometric information will be taken away from the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra service fee of $26.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. Space Agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13:00 by experts in astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that it would introduce a "discovery that will make a break in the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are, besides us, other creatures living in inhospitable conditions that were considered unoccupied, and who could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
According to appearances, it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere as it is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the true reach of the discoveries at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiotic Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of living on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron breed opposition "block"
The reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the arrival of "bipartism," they declare.
It has not yet been launched the 60th parliamentary term when the opposition bloc, led by the members of the parties PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "Particle of the Democratic Revolution" - .One thing: the arrival of "bipartisanship" in the House.
Before the start of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "thundered" against the reform of the Constitutional Act, as he excludes them.
This reform, they repeated, begins "bapartism" because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the PRD party coordinator, were the ones who voted against the Council, led by El Salvador López Brito by PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - note) and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute political marginality from the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He clarified that over the next few days they would speak to the representatives of the parties PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjected to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
“When I got here (opposition coalition), I’m looking at it because we’re out of any decision, they don’t even have a willingness to consider the opinion of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, said they would agree with the PRD, PT and the Patron, and therefore will form a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, so that Congress, after it was monopolistic, now be "duopore."
The aspiration of reforming the law is not to make endless bipartisanism in Congress.
This group starts with five lawmakers, and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynososo Esparza, from PT, explained that at the moment Congress has become a "boves" of two - alluding to the parties of PAN and PRI.
"Previously, only one side controlled it, today two are divided by it."
Patrón Montalvo asked that the Member's personality be respected to give him a seat at the negotiating table.
“The five deputies, of whom there are probably already nine of us, but right now see us in five, have not been left behind because of the vaulted agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have formed and agreed, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform.”
Another 200 thousand pesos are issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another check discussed to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial.
Another cheque for a slightly more than 200 thousand pesos was sent by the town hall to the town hall to the town hall to the town hall.
Thus, the sum paid for in this second half of the owner of the company supplying the electrical material will climb to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the town hall's transparency page, this last cheque number 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, was issued to the amount of 200.144.56 pesos and its subject was stated "equalification of unpaid payments".
Treasury Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay the supplier, which was monitored by the High State Revision Office for sale at high prices, another amount.
What has not been said is the total amount still owed by the town hall, and how many cheques will still be sent in favor of Camach Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been purchased now, it is only paid for what we owe it to, as well as other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on 15. October, 19. October, 29. October and this last November 16.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Charter, as stipulated by the law in the case of companies audited by the High State Revision Office, to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasurer assured that the services of the town hall did not use the services of the town hall again.
In the previous time, after 25. In July, the newspaper Noroeste published a review of the cheques issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9th in the period from March 2008 to 9. In July 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camach Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the party of Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to the hollows at the Sánchez Taboada party, the tourist sector in Mazatlan is asking authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, not showing the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorado Trades Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see a mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for a day, and they don’t have any idea of the revenues they are leaking, otherwise they wouldn’t have dealt with these matters that long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the crash of the tourist was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The town hall will have to take responsibility and prevent such a repeat, will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not just to repair existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area should be maintained, after all, even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its strategy of maintenance of the city".
There are other places that look neglected and pathetic, he noted, such as the lybian Emblem and El Venaditito (monument, statue of deer).
"Nowadays, in order for tourists to come, it does not only matter the promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city abounding in the purity of its beaches and streets, where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The necessary attention was not paid to it here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places to put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-seater of Tourist Prommotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, but it will first need to be put in order to make these places more attractive and to be able to put them on the list we have to promote this destination.”
IP asks for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, would like MPs to take a great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of dignified work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanding the business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is convulsing in convulsions and facing major problems.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 from the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Allianceza, two from the PRD party, one from the PT, one of the Convergencia party and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patronions will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, chairman of the Coordination Coordination Co-Entrepreneighgate (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 deputies of Congress take great responsibility and set an example on the path for a better Sinaloa in the various challenges he faces.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to advance their own interests and become carnival processions of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why he talked about the need to confirm the commitment to set the necessary bridging, which would move the ruling forward in order.
“We do that they need to do a decent job and to be committed primarily to society and sectors, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who gave them confidence in their vote in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of Tres Islas, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in an effort to achieve the country’s economic growth, as the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in some way.”
As far as tourism is concerned, he asked that the new lawmakers give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
“I’ve learned that it’s the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that this is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which, moreover, directly competes with agriculture.”
In addition, in order to issue funds for starter tourism projects, Congress should help supply the state to the security and assistance with the Alcohol Act, which has not been resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
The Three Kings are being sought
Dolls, cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the list of wishes for children in the family of Coronad's Valenzuel family.
It will be hard for their parents to fulfill their ideas on the upcoming Feast of the Three Kings, as their household counts exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Balthazar will give them toys and clothes that they so much desire.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in Colonia Salvador Allende in poor circumstances as the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes we have it hard because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go with the "peleans" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like clothes in size for one year.
"I've been told (José Alfredo) 'I wish this monster auto', but I told him 'we're going to see son, 'we're going to be very expensive,'" he recalls Cayetan's sadness.
For older children who were just at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is 12, 10-year-old Isaias size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so he could use a couple of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronad's Valenzuel family, you can participate in the "Looking for Three Kings" campaign, and at the reception of the newspaper Noroeste bring a gift or money in cash.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Dozens of tours were conducted in Egriism, Wednesday, as part of the disposal of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people were arrested and face various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places used to make drugs.
"Approximately 750 Indian hemp beds, four kilograms of hashish, money and a device that served for production was seized," Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman, said in a statement.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, both alleged heads of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to come to the judicial palace in Sherbrooke after their arrest.
They could face allegations of making Indian cannabis, holding it in order to trade it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These searches were subsequently carried out after a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information that we received from the public and that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," M. Ruel.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police departments investigating the city of Egri State Police Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrooke and the Sherbrooke Memphrémagog Police Administration.
Ilegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will evidently be overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand up to the party that built the granite under your feet," said the head of the Liberals, Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week-long meeting of the week-long du caucus.
The liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow for up to one year to be held by any person coming from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Ducep, also said he could not support the bill because he was heading for the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do,” M said. Ducep.
The NPD critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticisms who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“Neo-democrats agree to take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that’s what we consider to be the main part of another bill, C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney blamed opposition parties.
"Canadadians are telling MPs in bulk that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada into aim and treat it as some sort of sycophant."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, Secretary Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to votes to reject it.
One conservative told the QMI that the government would ask the vote to make every MP who opposes answer for his position in front of his constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement, on the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption unit and a collusion, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public investigative commission on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil is aiming to ensure that this idea does not fall into oblivious: Quebec intends to consult the Department of Investigation of New York City as early as January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit available since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec 29. October last year this measure was not discussed despite the fact that Robert Dutil himself was present.
More was not needed for a critic of public security, PQ party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate this announcement as a "king-out pulled out of a hat" and an "amaterist solution on the knee."
Minister Dutil himself answered those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ president, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of witness hearings during a public trial.
"In addition, Mr. Charest confirms himself that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and I, that he is hiding something," he explains.
“The only way to achieve the creation of the commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Higher Civil Servants.
In order to emerge from this dead end, he suggested Quebec to grant special authority to the inspector-general so that he could investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, whom they allow them to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also be after Ottawa to change the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request would be based on the agent for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law for this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Public Security Secretary Vic Toews has confirmed that his judiciary colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently addressing some of the amendments linked to the file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, even though the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall, which have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauritius, landslide.
Two houses were pre-evacuded.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters was not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hit the most.
A total of up to 100 millimeters could fall there.
If we add up these precipitations with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of floods in some watercourses.
The Quebec rescue service issued a warning on Wednesday evening of the dangers of floods for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest Laurentitis, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière caused strong rainfalls to flooding some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the outpouring of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency and oversees the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a safety adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center issued a warning on Wednesday for strong floods for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blew
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Standards (RRTV) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to gross expression during broadcasts.
The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting considers that Mr Dupont and his group of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and the inappropriated negative account of Haitians' gross expression that does not correspond to broadcasting broadcasts during the day."
The Council also concluded that discussions on suicide, including broadcasting the name of the two people who took their own lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council has received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcast, broadcasting between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaint of the Joint Front of the recipients of Quebec social support.
The group complained that the amounts indicated on the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must present reliable information, not deceptive.
As for suicide, host Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the transmitted report was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcasting of the 'Dupon's midday news' have come across a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
No rebuke to him.
The latest dispute was the statement following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort thus went into a media shootout that provoked many reactions.
The moderator of the CHOI said he had not sent any donation to help the Haitians, because we cannot know for sure that the needy will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of Haitians.
"I've already atoned for my three-day delay."
“My file has been intact for one and a half years,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in the broadcast.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcast cooperated "beyond its duties".
For the station, which will have to notify, inter alia, these decisions once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung fuvà of Montreal.
The inn of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, is extremely strange.
An athlete who excels in "sandy" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the tatami and rings around the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, Algeria, Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008, to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a bit everywhere because for those who don't like the game on the ground that's appearing in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this guy who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS has just just given his opponents bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30. October, in Edimburg, in Scotland.
"I won the category of kickbox full contact and Thai boxing, he stated."
"I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in the san shou."
"They were invited by opponents who finished first four at the last World Cup in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 in China, I finished in the fifth-ranked tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, he added."
"Interestingly, in every competition, I've made some progress."
"I'll be at this rate my first year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China, where punches with fists and feet, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches traditionally take place on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, arising from this form of struggle, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal is to keep only one result in her career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the super-tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl in the kung-f.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains the sympathetic guy."
"It's kind of the equivalent for Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before he suffered a loss in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete in order to be crowned a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 contracted millions without public tenders
Hydro-Québec agreed to a mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-A-Sarclele-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium created from BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project totaling $295 million without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of the Énergie of the Gérance, was authorized in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergies" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, a complaint about a consortium of companies puts before us a serious problem of an ethical nature that risks the exclusion of competition and will provoke price increases.
"It's a new way to implement a collusion and eliminate competition."
“This means that people, no longer make side deals secretly, they are already doing them openly,” Sylvain Simard, a PQ MP, said at a news conference.
A little earlier, morning, M. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to bear how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon, objected to the fact that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own way," she thundered, claiming that the PQ was "dishonest" and "missed accuracy."
She said that "that would be the least of it" that she would apologize to the PQ.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited over time that allows two or more businesses to group their mutual expertise to respond to a call for bids for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the comprehensiveness of the work.
Construction is already underway and must be scheduled until 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consulting in engineering is under investigation in the government.
If we fly over the market register of queeb companies at speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
In this way, Dessau operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; namely CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
As for the consortium of Énergie geerance, Minister Normandeau underlined the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is characterized by a particular dynamic of the working force and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 70's."
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to sow the forehead at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public tender and if there are few participants in the competition filing an offer, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: i.e. that you take the people who figure in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, "Let's make a deal satisfactory and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the importance is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract granted to the Énergie deriction consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50 000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-A-Sarcle-Rupert project.
After verifying Le Devoir, he counted 109 contracts for consultancy in the field of engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories performing soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin raked 22 contracts, of which the Genivar acquired 16 of them, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a stake in the "Énergies of the Géance".
All contracts were concluded.
Together they are 449 783 $3,344, including a contract with Énergie Gérance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good advancing Liberal Party Quebec."
Minister Normandeau has released a report that PQ was also linked to companies that are "funding" it before clarifying that it was more of its managers.
Responsible consumption barometer - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also "impartial" brands and environmental certificates, to follow them accordingly when choosing products.
Worst of all, even though we bathe in the media universe that urges us to encourage and encourages socially more responsible consumption, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, the failure to fulfil the obligations it qualifies even as a brake on its commitment, Baromèter says responsible consumption, the first article of which came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the inhabitants of Quebec, who try to sell them, still do not believe them very much
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t trust environmental companies’ promises, simply because the company’s green advertising is finding a measuring tool developed by the Disaggregation of Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates, accompanied by so-called fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that are identified as environmentally responsible, Barometer reports.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount to stimulating this consumption side, which is currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, a vacuum and the dubious nature of information would be mitigated by the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebekuse’s population is inhavingly opposed to the data on products or “green” services we are looking to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
61% of them preferred shopping at merchants from their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, according to Baromètr.
The more "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Quebek likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks the least possible impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience obviously stayed somewhere out of their car, Baromètre says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they were using public transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people in the interest of protecting nature.
Walking and the wheel were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive conduct survey, who used this Cliché.
Loan to the state to buy the eXcentris cinema complex
The Quebec government, which we have asked for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the participation, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinematic complex on the tabloid of Saint-Laurent, which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not obtain what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebec government proposes a loan, the amount of which would be lower, some of the original expectations that could build the basis for a viable solution under favorable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and plan of action was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, which manages the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus has until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the donation from the state must indeed be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec opposed the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentres, inferring that the Minister of Culture should not finance the real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion, on the contrary, demanded fundamental economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his cinemas during the ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been a reason for altering from the state's financial council.
The lack of halls for independent films is gaudy in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its forefront, is running a campaign to release funds into the private sector, believing it will $700 000 to push through the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27. February next year and screen Xaviera Beauvois's most beautiful film Men and the Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devair and so ignored, he and his group think about the proposals for shrinkage that are made to him.
The raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources cited by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States see as a complex of Canadians' inferiority against Americans, but in the same way reveals its sense of superiority of the latter against Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian electorate is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when they go to the polls, and they believe that President Obama’s visit helped the conservative government to accept its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, among which were the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday on public showcase, provide sensitive details to get each other "under the skin."
The announcement with the date of September 22, 2008, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, sets out in detail at what point the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian inferiority complex, almost absent, makes possible political leaders conditional on talking about internal bets, instead of realizing that this election also applies to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
“The United States is, therefore,” he concluded, “the proverbial elephant in this election: the ubiquitous but potentially too threatening to be talked about.”
The ambassador understands this "foolful silence" all the less so because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It stands to reason that the ability of a candidate, a party or even better the party leader to run these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Brees, the chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the preservation of the government in the vote of confidence in early February, concerning the federal budget, to which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than a decade, over a recovery plan of $30 billion to $40 billion,” M writes. Breese.
No mention of the fact that the government had to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that opposition parties condition their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of an increasingly negative image that is casting on the United States by dramatic series broadcasting on the CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasting Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are not very savvy references to Maher Alar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogations at the CIA.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some Guantanamo detainees.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case case" principle.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, secretary of state."
"The sect has accepted that she would revise the file."
Let us finally note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
It's been reported, and Mike Huckabee has heard about it in the United States.
World Light Restoration Plan
Yesterday, the UN proposed a plan in Cancun to restore home lighting, lighting shops and industrial premises in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect (GES) that corresponds to nearly one-third of the further restrictions to stabilize the planet's climate from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at a stage of major concrete projects to push through in Cancun to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement commitments to reduce on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if hot bulbs, which monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, we replace flu-co-packed or, even better, bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) GES emissions on the planet due to lighting would be eliminated.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world’s emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of emissions from an automotive park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, Canada, among them, engaged in voluntary reduction plans, which should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve by 2020 stabilization of climate heating to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude that it will not get out of control.
In hot bulbs 95% of energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5% is the product of light.
With flu-competitive bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new incinerators with DEL, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Flu-compact bulbs last from 6000 to 10 000 hours on average.
New bulbs with DEL, such, which this week put into production Philips - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have an expected life of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of possible savings with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All these new bulbs can also work with rheotus and emit less heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about flu-combat bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up collection centres.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the flu-economic bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants that emit many of the mercury needed to generate electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centers put into circulation 25 000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also outlines in detail the profits that any country would from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the results of election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stressed the need for an independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results," the UN President's spokesman said.
"He asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiatives until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had the latest date - Wednesday midnight - without posting the results, three days after Sunday's scrutin.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission is "addressed at work" so that it could announce the results.
On Wednesday, around the world, the CEI has been multiplied to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on annulment by the Constitutional Council for the "fraudulent" vote in the north, which is managed by the former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup d'etat in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast-Campionship, confirmed that the manoeuvres of intimidation of voters practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country have discouraged the supporters of President Côte d'Ivoire of Côte d'Ivoire.
Elections could be annuled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
But President Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s high court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a person from the north who denounces any connection with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but didn't go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the release of the results because he knows he has suffered the loss, and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from broadcasting the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, taking place on Sunday, was seen as a coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been split into two-half for years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the political faction of Côte d'Ivoire that it could be blamed for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, 31. October, as the winner with 38% of the votes versus 32% for Alassana Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained steadily at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7%, including overseas areas), as evidenced by the provisional seasonal deviation correction (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has steadied at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In a broader scope, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of the current young people on the labour market has further escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25%, including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
As far as the elderly are concerned, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is, 482 000 people from the age of 50, up to 6,6%, including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 saw a benefit from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points per three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a polemic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after it was 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and taken into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Board of Trustees Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly subjudicated.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abusing the company's assets, abusing public funds and public property, concealing, granting bribery, accepting bribery in order to influence the office and holding ammunition, his attorney says.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists that the judge and explain to themselves all the questions he wants to ask him, not some mirlusions."
“It’s easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but there’s another thing to prove them,” his attorney, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he sent a brief message to the judge before his questioning to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than ensuring the functioning of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
When it comes to awarding contracts or a destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew about anything like that, said Mr. Simon.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director-general of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was charged on Wednesday for the misuse of public funds and plots, and left at large, under judicial supervision with a ban on the prominence of the protagonists of the matter.
"My client was able to give an explanation to all the facts he was accused of."
"The investigating judge is taking this into account and leaving him free," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said in a statement.
Another four people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, saying they were under judicial supervision for two of them, state prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of Marseille Provence Métropol (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes in order to influence the office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier are charged, one for "alienation and misuse of the company's property," the other for "completion in the misuse of public funds."
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "covering the abuse of the company's assets."
Among the persons confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in the parallel case of fraudulent public procurement related to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were helping to launder money from a large gangster.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the waste.
From the source of the nearby investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotatat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Marseille city community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée Palace exaggerated Syria's mediation
Over the more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the plight of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran over "spurime," united the views in France, citing diplomacy on combat alert, stressing relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents, received via WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde, reveal some of the downsides of the crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to manage such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how leading French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not compensation against the release of Majid Kakavan, an Iranian imprisoned in France and a wanted U.S. judiciary for the substantive material trafficking in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting the sharp light to the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't really do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is headlined: "Iran: French comments on how to deal with in the case of hostages".
An adviser from the Elysée Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa, the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks to the representative of U.S. diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise the Americans to do so enough to be brought back to their homeland by its own nationals forcibly held in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "constantly emphatically pronounce "in the media the words "fundamental rights," "innocentness," "immediate deliverance."
It is necessary to bring into trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it the more, the more they ask you to stop.”
As attempts to negotiate through discriminatory channels have taken place, "shorts of nothing," the Iranians are "masters for evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "Iran's family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail."
It announces that the liberation of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French Embassy provides her with refuge) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (bail 230 000 euros).
And he will announce that the Elysée Palace is anticipating the hostage cases, a phenomenon that "was going to escalate."
Iranians "may have been able to arrest another 1800 French people living in Iran in the future," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive in relation to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as many observers, inquire about this worrying consensus.
For Washington, which is persecuting illegal Iranian networks to obtain material intended for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept the bargaining?
The liberation of the Iranian for the liberation of the young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, as he states, was not only "surprised by this judge's decision," but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the presidency and the justice minister" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but the "French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" surveillance of the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Elysee Palace dials a phone number, hangs a telephone receiver, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Parisian buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of the imprisonment of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized "escapes" to the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator."
Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and they say that manipulation bears fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blost" of French official officials".
On what constitutes such a degree of "gratitude", expressed against M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their statements, full of hymnal French officials in privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication "directs to validating President Sarkozy's policy opening to Syria," he analyzes.
The policy applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labelled premature and undeserved."
By "as it exaggerates the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria, what kind of hymns can earn when it plays a constructive role in the area."
The goal is also to "sow the grain of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
August 11, François Richier confided in him: "of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them nonetheless."
“This should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot."
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecivalsky," which will forbid adolescents to play online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, the government's responsible officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight on persons under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
“We believe that this bill is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, a senior official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government also presupposes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for the young, whose parents will request it, the responsible worker added.
It will also provide free programs available to people who ask for it, allowing you to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "disabled" countries, and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
At the same time, the country is an indisputable master in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Championships of 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full unrest on suspicion of corruption is established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday the host countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a top-notch venture, where the struggle for influence and lobbying risks overtaking technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the royal Fifa competition in 2018 will be held in Europe , the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to be placed in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to attend as part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, lead government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political bets around the world.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations face the risk of lasting until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the assessment report Fifa documentation English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022), they contain the best arguments, as do the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have much weight for 22 members of the executive committee at an hour intended for voting.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two CE members of the CE /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarily et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chances of its country, the cradles of football, which so far have hosted the World Championship only once, a year.
The BBC put the crown on this on Monday when it broadcast a document that "tangled the pin" three influential CE members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatu.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and bring to the difficulties of English leader executives with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move that was successful in his predecessors, Tony Blair, who managed to win the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Will this intensive activity be enough for England to give a new sheen to its CE name (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal is not lacking the trump cards of already prepared stadiums, its accolades (World Championships in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the gloomy economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Any retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the payment of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stations, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in verbal allusions barely tampered with the accusations of the English press against CE members (European Commission).
“We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them,” said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, with its considerable 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorite.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of Fifa, it seems that this country is having a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, has made a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem to be premature for both countries that jointly underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa ardently wishes, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar, who pulled a large ace from his sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for flimsy TV (due to time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for Fifa.
Second mandate: obvious (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand has made the impression that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace is calling someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it must be done as if doubts persisting.
In one and the other in a sense.
In 2006, without wanting to believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims so that the third mandate would not be ruled out.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would "apply sometime in the fall of 2011."
As he reminds him of the members of the UMP on Wednesday night at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" sowed a little feverish.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notice.
This is not the first time he has been reminiscent of such meetings in a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His statements yesterday will not make him more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of double truth.
Accelerating the way to run for PS, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to the Suckiness of Ségolène Royal pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to be convicted.
This is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want to be premature rather than intended for the fight assemblies.
Poor survey on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy over Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," the people from the prime minister immediately and vigilantly responded.
“If he believes a possible defeat, he will not run,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"Still he'll believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with clarity.
Euro: The central European bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year was to be an opportunity to specify the conditions for the removal from the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis is committed by the sovereign European receivable, the institute for issuing securities will no doubt be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration in the situation already tense in European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be all the higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of resolving the European Union receivable crisis.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection for my European partners (...) ".
The evening before that, in Brussels, in his questioning by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove to be more elogenous in terms of his intentions, and he satisfied that he stated that the program of buying state titles on the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting held this Thursday.
The only certainty: the Central European Bank will monitor its basic unchanging interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds made by the Treasury made by the Central European Bank have doubled to almost €1.35 billion in the last week.
And thanks to the unreasonability of the budgets on the market, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have bought €67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts among anticipation market conciliators about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in the exchange rate.
If the operations of loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter bank proceeds to the unrestricted provision of liquid funds according to generous conditions and for a duration of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine changing her program in a significant way."
“If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, "The European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds to revive the dull market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the exposures of European banks in the upper-salted euro area markets, there is no choice but to maintain their presence in the market.
“It needs to replace the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent paid performances from becoming the most fragile,” the bond manager said.
Because if interest rates take off, countries will worry about it all the more so to reduce their debt instead of stabilizing it.
It's a saving of the euro at this cost.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi hunching back
After the beginning of the week for Italy, the disturbing situation relaxed a little, yesterday with a recurrence of bond interest rates for 10 years.
Return to Temporary Peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy of the Regions, the leaders of the regions said they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualifying the situation as "indissolvable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demented the participants.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest rates reached a record of 210 basic points, and the price of bankruptcy risk-risk contracts (CDS) went up to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "frogly" "tormous market developments" and a possible contagion originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and lack of fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state to the risk of not being able to cover up its financing needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected from now on at 1.1% in 2011 and at 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate to analyse, at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public finance deficit will still account for 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against the 3.9% foreseen government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of a new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," assesses Economic Affairs Commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
“The cornerstones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund’s Board of Trustees under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, nor short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of the gross domestic product of 2011, the NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the efforts required from other countries,” notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OCDE.
There is a question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion to vote no-confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, elections that are expected to be held at the end of March could begin.
This would start a period of time, not very suitable for taking a decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking of strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stressed it again yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very in solidarity determined, engaged to defend their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion, concerning interest on European state bonds, brought water to the mill to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
The Office for the Notation Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade the record of Portugal's debt, the target of the most focused on the various speculations.
“Because in May there is a lack of transparent and obvious policy, consisting mainly on banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
All the more so because "political time is running slower than the time of the market."
Aware of this interrupted context and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected issue, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
This is with regard to Eurogroup (Eurogroup) meetings and Ecofin Grouping from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank’s meeting is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, covered the trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this is not the goal of this trip to increase funds, it certainly paves the way to achieve this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, an official official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilized funds by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
First and foremost, the countries involved in Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly as regards the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are joining strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than Greece and Ireland used.
The two countries want to avoid at all costs of seeking international aid before they make their own budgetary corrections and, before deciding on structural reforms, necessary to regain their enduring confidence.
The capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether 750 billion euros would be enough for Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the EU would not hesitate to reach for the stock market.
Economists at Barclays Capital, the actor of the very first trade plan for European sovereign claims, believe that an increase of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means is: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized by €60 billion on this date.
A Council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 regions have an orange emergency.
Snow rations cause further difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activity.
Twenty-four districts have an orange emergency room from now on due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne, joined 20 counties that have already declared an orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, the problems in the north la Gironde and the Charentes forest have a significant snowfall and lightly snowing on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and a blanket from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and districts of the regions of Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The torrents of snow are big enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of the Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods - trucks above 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to police, road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, and police recommend going out with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
In Picardia, school flights were banned for Thursday.
No specific measures to restrict freight transport are foreseen on Wednesday evening.
The district office "requires all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt the ride to the nature of the road".
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy Airport and 10% to Orly on Thursday due to expected snow torrential snow.
DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to connect with their company.
Gatwick Airports in south London and Edinburgh Airports in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Billions have been raining since the debate on the modernisation of transport at Ile-de-France is in full swing.
At least during the discussion.
We especially commemorate the 23 billion in the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the state announced the provision of a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
In theory, this is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is examined by the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains mechanisms to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax on Ile-de-France.
First, we will read in the text of the bill, Article 15, read "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated: "The yield on this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists to "to be modernized, in order to increase the yield from it obtained and to affect this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would it take?
A mirlusion.
This is not quantified in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources are joining the €4 billion of capital subsidies that will be mobilized by the state and inserted into the Société du Grand Paris project according to the project," we can read in an explanation of the reasons.
In the company of SGP, this system does not seem shocking to us.
“From the moment we created revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then dig into 4 billion, it explains here.”
"It will be integrated into the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that $4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billions promised belongs to the still-absent subscribers, risks triggering a rather busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Revenge hackers and hardy spies
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates the future by controlled regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that each document compiled by a secret service (of any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of Americans about the way Berlusconi's sexual life is announcing what everyone has been able to read for months in any newspaper (all except these two Berlusconi own), and Gaddafi's infamous cartoon profile has long been a subject for sketches for long.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of messages already known is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars, or the Freemasons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to look for reports about non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what they have confirmed what they have previously learned.
This is the mechanism of success of Dan Brown.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and the lazy (or limited spirit) of the head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, an editor in the newspaper Libération), who considers only what he himself admits to be true.
The information with high secessibility of Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the state department, was the same that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why did so much fuss about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War and since the heads of state can call or fly down on the plane to dinner together, they have lost their diplomatic function, and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, they have transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching the investigation films knows very well that only out of hypocrisy seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated publicly is defamed the duty of hypocrisy and sheds bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most severely classified information in the world is a hard blow, not a non-negligible, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "executors."
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in the times of Orwell, it was possible to conceive all the power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen has become the complete victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now that even the "tprobes" with the most secret information of the powerful can not resist the intervention of some hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - chosen as an avenger of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can power that no longer has the ability to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that George Simmel has already said that a true secret is a meaningless secret (and a meaningless secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, meaningless secret because it is pulled out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was all the secrets of all the secrets of Hillary Clinton.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of the bailout so significant?
Obviously, in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - this would be tantamount to its publication on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies, it is useless to hope that it is possible to keep the message secrecy over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and has teamed up with one of his colleagues.
How will they be able to keep private and sensitive messages undercover in the future?
I know that for now my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are transporting discreetly filling formalities on uncontrollably routes and bringing only those messages that know by heart or rather hide rare information in the heel of the shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in sealed sockets: in total, the attempted espionage in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is backwards.
One century after a wireless telegraph was revolutionizing communications, the Internet was rehabilitating a telegraph based on wires (telephone).
Video cassettes (analogists) have allowed cinema lovers to shoot the film step by step, move it forward and backward, and reveal all the secrets of the montage, while now CDs (digit) only allow you to jump in chapters, that is, after macro-ports.
Through high-speed trains, we arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane and transportation, which includes we need three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn carriages.
The last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what was orchestrated in the secrecy of the embassy.
It is now embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to try to keep promises for quickly unblocked financing (meaning fast start financing (fast start) or premature), implemented by developed countries.
And big French hacks have been detected
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion for three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e., 420 million per year).
At the launch of the COP16, the EU pulled out a large ace to convince its partners of the reality of its fast start financing commitment: a report specifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released €2.2 billion in 2010 and is bringing it on the right path to keeping its promise of $7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is realised without harming Public Assistance for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered the year 2009 as a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to three years of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment dates or deadlines at the level of public aid for development.
France, on the other hand, believes that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous periods or the Global Level of Public Assistance for the Development of d'Aide publique au Developpement.
Specifically, the total amount of support for France towards developing countries may remain constant (or even reduce) to comply with its commitment to the financing of "new and additional "...
Another crucial element is the division into donations and loans.
There is no rule there yet, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, they consider that 1€ borrowed equals 1€ donated.
Evidently, this is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be documented for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get, as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it by virtue of our obligations, but as the price of a loan for a lending country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only give such a reason: it "teats" its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% makes a loan ($389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify this yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany has claimed 46% from there, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their obligations with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ to satisfy its promise, France will give only 10 centimeters and consider this effort to be comparable.
Beautiful juggler piece!
To summarise, in its financing of the "fast start" France operates with double swindling: on the one hand, with the development of the stock over time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only 36.1 million euros, it can convince that it is issuing 420 million euros of "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (since it seems that although it is Bercy, who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would the member states continue to donate when it is enough to lend?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not entirely naive...
The chapter of early funding is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw knowledge from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce the change in its manner of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respecting its obligations and deference and fairness to other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions about deposits in long-term financing (another fundamental chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way loans are paid in.
France should change its position to become as progressive for these deposits as for others.
So everyone is putting hope in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancunu next week.
The surprise announcement of the fast launch of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to advance further in the discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that children eat.
A ten-year-old eats 81 different chemicals one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "do not have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of analyzed samples, but are characteristic of the issue processed," bought foods commonly consumed in four meals between July and September and one light meal as a light snack per child roughly ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five substances are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disturbing for internal excretions (PE), according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Center for Research on Cancer.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical received individually are not exceeded, in our research we can see well that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten residuals with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, cited as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including in France, a prohibited fungicidal agent.
The same goes for green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where studies have discovered traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, the steaks of minced meat, tuna in a can and even bun and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 discovered chemical residues, and even analysing a plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," according to the study.
The Environmental Europe-Categolin (EE-LV) association has proposed "face-based face to an urgent situation" to set up a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase of civilization diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the state of the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
