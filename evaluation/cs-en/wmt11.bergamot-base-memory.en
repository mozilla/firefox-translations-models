What will he do? The ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry shop
The new councillors of the capital of the ČSSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier to understand their old-school colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the council.
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz "tested" the members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they know the notorious slang that was created at the town hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which Prague’s political cream introduced during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillor did not understand the familiar concepts very much.
At least that's what he says.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, a councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "godfather" dictionary.
And although he is a political veteran, Councillor Karel Březina reacted similarly.
Like the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you're presenting to me, which I sometimes use."
"Otherwise, I don't generally recognize slang."
From the glossary, whose terms the daily Aktuálně.cz published this June before the ODS electoral congress, the editors selected six examples, mainly those notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the pastry shop", "bull neck", "beauty of the capital" and "shelling".
The trio of councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is supposed to head the Prague education system in the future - first promised the interview, but later he did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused the test.
"I don't deal with these things at all, and I'm not going to evaluate how the civic Democrats are having fun."
"I'm working out how we're going to understand each other in our programs," he said.
As already mentioned, Councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the headline above that he is talking about an influential businessman and friend of the ex-prime minister Bém Roman Janoušek.
"Voldemort" Kaucky doesn't tell him anything, and the only term he correctly estimated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, adding: "But I know more from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole is then deciphered as a Blanka tunnel by the administration not only by the matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for the environment Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plaché is familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the term "go to the pastry shop".
"I mean that means going to a Prague company," is Shay close to deciphering that it is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In the same way, he recalls that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test attendants, there is no such well-established glossary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes shortcuts and name-made fractures are used," says Petr Hulínský, chairman of the Prague-based ČSSD, who is nicknamed Hulda by the party.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," confesses Karel Březina to his own nickname.
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz has tried and works.
Councillor Weinert is for the party of Děd or less friendly Dědek, the councillor Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the election fraud in the sponsorship of the party, has the nickname "Igráček" for some colleagues.
The challes are also the only thing the Social Democrats admit in intra-party language.
Hulínský is said to be glad to hear Hulda, but the daily Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague chairman.
The "Doctor of Baton Law" is said to be reminded that Petr Hulínský obtained his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches," issued a brochure
The women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common features.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot get involved in work, for example, for health reasons, they are free and do not have children.
The one who "becomes" the witch is sent into isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man will very rarely make this fate."
"Even young healthy women are not being pushed away because they help with work and give birth to children," describes the order's sister, who in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso cares for more than a hundred women in a special house who have expelled their community from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure."
She has published an information booklet to help curb the witch hunt.
But the thing has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper Die Standard pointed out of the disadvantage of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, seventy-two-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, spilling kerosene and setting herself on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman ignited oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
He was said to have burst into flare after the group wanted to "drive the evil spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a forty-two-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Human soul eaters have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the witch hunt is trying to moderate the government, in the Gambia the president himself participated in it last year.
"After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammi unleashed a large-scale witch hunt that was supposed to be involved in her death and try to kill the president himself with the help of black magic."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and personal security guards of the president, forcibly led randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, trapped people had to drink a potion from herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
Bakal's tenant: He drowns in stoves, higher rent signed
An elderly stocky man stepped out of the door of the client center of RPG Byty "carbon" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it new leases to three apartments: his, his daughter and his son, who is in prison.
All three of them just deregulation raised their rent.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay 4100 crowns for the apartment 2+1 of the second category from next year.
"And it's not hot water, and petrama has to be drowned," the man points with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has power of attorney.
"But I signed it," he explains half angrily and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and indecent," advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man is just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that still have non-market rent in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Currently.cz has therefore decided to visit the "lab" in person.
Havířov waiting room RPG is one of a total of four in the Ostrava region and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Next to the door stands a security guard from a security agency and a recording device.
"Rent 2011", shines a special button on its touchscreen.
One tap and a paper with a number comes out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your figure is already beeping on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, it's your turn.
After a while, an elderly married couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room is clearly not at all related to the new rents.
Most people have come to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
Letters with new leases in the Ostrava region are received in post offices by tenants of most of the total of 44 thousand RPG portfolio apartments since about mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes to them in letters an increase in the rent of 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new rents was opened at the client centre on November 18.
"It runs through the week, so it's only in the run-up," the worker replies behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining flats are a local ignitable theme.
Before the elections, he was quite loudly seized by the deputy speaker of parliament and Ostrava native Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and even now the local newspaper is full of it.
"Twenty years after that, I want a new floor."
"Even the pos..a. the record in the toilet was not changed," the man said in the introduction.
Most so far, according to the workers, pensioners are coming to see if they get a discount on rent if they sign in time, as the RPG in the special offer promises.
Half the discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
However, the Havířov "deregulation" partition is definitely not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here for 2011," the worker behind the counter estimates.
On the web and its bulletin boards, RPGs propose individual negotiation of contracts where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about only a possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG points out on its website.
"No one will sue here," one of the RPG Byty workers thinks, and the man on the street in front of the client center makes her partially right.
"I have a 13 thousand pension and I have five thousand left to eat, I don't have enough to judge," he argues.
But the worker becomes insecure.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he said.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"Existing rents still do not even reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the angry tenant complained of the neglect of the housing stock is, according to the homeowners, the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPGs from rents could invest four billion in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havířov waiting room repeats some red highlighted information.
"The increase in rents in 2011 by 15% and less relates to 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the apartments RPG."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 Kč per square meter and month," he appears on the screen.
For only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent will rise by 38 percent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19,66 Kč per square meter," the RPG points out.
For 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents by leaps, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see chart) will be put back by the company to the apartments, mainly in thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
They are preferably given to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
The offices also include a nursery, the architects understood
The administrative building of Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect it to hide a mini-school with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it can be attended by children of Arch.Design employees.
The design-architectural company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important buildings in Brno, has been counting on space for its corporate mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs nearly 90 people, mostly at the age of baby boom, and she cared about allowing women designers and architects to get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of short-time work, the nursery is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the social program.
Thus, builders and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding employment with the care of a child.
The mini-school was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of 2, 8 million. CZK) could purchase equipment and equipment and for two years provide qualified personnel and operation.
After exhaustion of the financial subsidy (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to run a mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and Economy Rating significantly helped with the application for the subsidy.
Care is provided by qualified staff, children are taken care of by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher all day, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are over 3 years old.
Because it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day there are more.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the programmatic content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but also provide quality teaching - from basic cognition to preparation for school benches, English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and avoid stressful situations with delayed pick-up of children from kindergartens far from the parents' workplace.
Parents use working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that a naturally loyal relationship is created here by an employee-employer.
Arch.Design has thus joined Czech companies offering significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house is fascinated by the bone even after 100 years. Look into the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
Such is the Casa Batlló house in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The house, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade resembling scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí's Art Nouveau.
The facade of the house is played by dream lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In detailed observation, you can see the geometry, rhythm and precisely thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of the colors is even more enhanced.
Winding and twisting shapes with the same appearance in the interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepholes and skirting boards.
House Batlló, which stands in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The renovation took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea for an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The apartment building Casa Batlló, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
It was co-operated with by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his designer plank that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of the mosaic on the facade.
A number of other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs of the Casa Batlló house started the successful collaboration of Jujola with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí’s house Casa Milá and Park Güell, in which there are other works of Gaudí.
From the locals, the house soon after completion earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others began to call it a "yawning house" because of the specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys for his time.
The bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree slope.
In the creation of Gaudí, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, during the completion, the city council was horrified by the result and asked for a remedy.
Councillors were annoyed, for example, that the building interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
The correction never took place, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the call of the city district, Josep Batlló applied (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house cuts through the staircase, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon door and the larger company can communicate with each other comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also received an unconventional roofing and two extra floors.
Also impressive is Gaudí's game with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which are lined with an inner courtyard, and skylights.
The game of two colors adds maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and spectacular apartment is made available to the public.
The owners decided for this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the hundred and 50th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed with the tours because they found out that it was a very advantageous enterprise and in addition extended the tours with common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20 percent discount.
The sum greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of the house with dragon turrets, you need to quickly become friends with one of the residents of the apartment building and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grid: women have different requirements than men
Not the opulent frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying surface, i.e. the mattress and the grid, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, a lot of things decide, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior into which mattresses and grates are purchased.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages, where they do not regularly drown, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
It is necessary to turn them over regularly.
If they do not have a lot of venting ducts in the core, and still lie on a solid plate, they retain moisture: Mold could also appear under them.
When choosing, the custom also decides.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where a lot of high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"They needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam for their battered shoulders, heels and hips."
"Such are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they misunderstand "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers, were looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's okay, the appropriate mattress has Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat, or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won't overturn at night like after a tough game.
You just get better sleep.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to its height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Both a man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, single-lists, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, guildmaster of the Upholstery Guild and Decorators, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years and lectures it at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grid and mattress, but be careful when buying to match the height of mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing left but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not be able to do this with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring frame of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the molding and loosening layer.
"When you touch your hands or get on the mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
All-upholstered beds, when mattresses and the base are like a combed Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses do not wind down, their cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will begin to resemble one large (and clogged) strainer.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its but.
Therefore, advice from sellers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and washing removable coating do not give up, but add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers with zigzags are commonly made today, so after opening we get two parts (for washing and washing size very important!), still, handling in larger types (and one person) when shooting could resemble a duel of light weight in a ring with heavy.
Do you have a solid board in bed instead of a grid?
Never! Never!
Maximum on the bed designed for one-night stands.
However, you can still provide the board (if it no longer has them) with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a loosening layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-positioning slats with 14 to 18 slats, but you will always pay for grids with a larger number of slats, 28 or more, where the slats in the loin area are doubled and it is possible to regulate their rigidity.
The positioning slats do not include mattresses with a spring frame, because they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, you can also indulge in the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push, or even tilt the slat, so that the shoulder sleeps nicely "burst".
For men who have "shoulders across their backs," definitely an important thing.
It is even remembered by mattress manufacturers, who in "men" started to use a softening zone just in the area of the shoulders.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface in the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate grates with so-called multitoral springing.
The pressure is broken down into multiple points and the voltage decreases.
However, beware, once you use on the right mattress and the grid the wrong pillow (large and "bloated"), most "plus" disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips only to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level the height of the shoulder (along with the shoulder cradle of the grid or the softened zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original straws stuffed with grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
The oil raw materials from which polyurethane foams are made are replaced by natural oils, such as jump and soy.
It is the soy that is used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašeček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh smell of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While the man is "cooled" by a plant extract of birch to absorb the cover of the mattress and cool the body, women, on the contrary, "heat" the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making it weaker to the sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cell structure, so it is more breathable than regular polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
Combining various stiffness of cold foams and "lazy" foam, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, loins and heels should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet health parameters tend to have a lower VAT rate are taken as medical aids.
It was the first to achieve this advantage of Gumotex in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and a grid is not easy.
Sometimes you can use, for example, events of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a sewn memory foam Memory into a cover for 11 990 crowns.
The second can be bought for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density was started by the Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
It was originally created as a material for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to enormous overload during the launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, on the contrary, it strengthens in the cold.
This adapts perfectly to the warm human body and breaks down its pressure optimally.
Therefore, it is ideal against the appearance of bedsores, but also for increasing the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example, for special pillows under the feet, which lighten the feet and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want to monitor people, so they want to keep their children safe
Fear for their own child is driving more and more people to the idea of GPS-based guarding.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help, for example, in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can only be big as a watch.
A number of people were frightened by the case of the missing Annie and began to look for means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about another means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy happening," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment for the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices may be misused, for example, if they put themselves in a bag to someone who doesn't know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most of the time, customers actually buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything similar, he will just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to lose some things on purpose when they don't want to be in control."
"Great expectations were previously raised by their parents, which can be turned off just like these tracking devices," Bočková said.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to the upcoming kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child has no electronics with him that can reveal his location."
"It's the phone now."
"When the tracking devices start to expand, they will look for them, too, because their sales will certainly be backed by massive advertising."
"In that case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police," the psychologist says.
However, it admits that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden infestation with a paedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to regularly send a location after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"More expensive devices have built-in and inclined meters, so even if a person just slips and stays motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with the position," says Čech.
According to him, a similar service can be done by smartphones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to pendants the size of matches or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"That will have the biggest advantage in the fact that a possible aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all."
"Or he'll only recognize them after a while and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology that is used for car monitoring.
It is a combination of location through the GPS system (which is used by common self-navigation) and the function of the mobile phone, which reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords that would wrap around the Czech Republic. It will last only two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords, which are launched explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 kilometers of cords to the warehouses.
The army has a supply for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought incendiary cords from the joint-stock STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, in justifying the purchase of such a huge number of incendiary cords, MF DNES wrote back that soldiers use 60 kilometers of fuses per year during training.
However, it follows from the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, which the MF DNES addressed, that all generals, officers of the command of the army, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of fuses.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if that were the case, the military's supplies would be enough for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, it were sufficient for the basic training of each new professional to provide a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord, as experts say, the army has secured supplies for the aforementioned 225 years with fresh purchases - even with increased consumption of engineer or special forces.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra personally that they had almost no small arms bullets, so the shootings are also limited due to the lack of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"It doesn't bother me that they buy such a large number of fuses from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they'll be up to."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to accommodate," says Jan Děcký, sales manager at STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, explains hundreds of kilometers of the purchased cord by saying that the army will have a supply of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only about the four-year life of the fighting and police or army pyrotechnics even about two years.
"With perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier because of criticism of the army, does not want to publish the name.
After the end of life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is the quantity discount on 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"We were sixty percent less than last year's van two hundred and forty-four kilometers," a spokesperson for Pejšek said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of the firing lines of police pyrotechnics, who dispose of ammunition from the Second World War or after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1 500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to consume this ammunition before the end of life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnics, and can also more flexiblely obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence already has considerable difficulties with the disposal of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the two-hundred-thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics approached by the MF DNES, the Czech one is facing the same problem in a few years: it will destroy hundreds of kilometers of old fuses, which it buys today.
To this day, I draw from the contacts I gained thanks to the competition
The winning place in the Tradesman of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the Tradesman of the Year competition was the twenty-eight-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that there was a lack of quality accommodation in Liberec at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a half-destructed house with five apartments.
The fact that he was still a student of the third year of college was very courageous.
"At that time, the ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation with us did not give me a chance not to try to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
He invested all his profits back into the house, which he gradually converted into a guesthouse with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, there was another, equally good quality.
"We just have a signed contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisá, where we sold our franchise concept and other people interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting," says last year's number one tradesman.
"And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel, it was the victory in the Tradesman of the Year competition that contributed to a large extent," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him more familiarity and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People got to know me on the streets, they often congratulated me on the extra and I have to say it was pleasant," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to all who are trying to do something.
It is not even necessary to win, every visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not have gotten to in any other way.
"I started trading with some of them I met thanks to the competition."
According to him, the fame associated with success has affected every employee.
And that he's in his 70s.
"I see more loyalty and pride in them to be involved in something that has received universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal achievement, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is put to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the purposefulness of the winner, Farmet has had worse times behind him.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žďárský, came to the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the Slavonic House.
At that time, the jury appreciated the effort through which it built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small toolmaking workshop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and boosted our confidence for the match with the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karel Žďárský’s father a small workshop to rent as compensation for the communist-seized property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father started a company for plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained more awareness even among the unprofessional public after the success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers started to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are cooperating with a company that has achieved more success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not just a sign of euphoria from the victory in the Farmet.
The award was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis, which has not yet touched so many citizens, has peaked, but companies have already stopped their investment projects and begun to restrict the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation has not been avoided by us."
"Revenue fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were also redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
What they did not discount in the Farmet, however, is the investment in research and development.
"From the subsidies we built a research and training center, we strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won the main award in domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Revenue is growing again, and with it the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to carry documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than four thousand voters voted on it.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper statement from the Commercial Register, although an official can obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the poll, it will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during inspections of insurance payers," said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for the CSSA.
To shine a light on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and the nonsense to abolish them is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This year is the fourth part of the business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny and is becoming more and more popular among the public.
If about three thousand voters took part in the vote last year, there were almost four thousand of them this year.
And no wonder, all sorts of legal obligations that serve only to delay business are still enough and enough for us.
"For example, in the number of lezters for tax returns, we are at the top of the world," remarks Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can file administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is then selected by the organizer of the competition to select seven candidates for the "anti-price" and let the public vote on it during October via the Internet on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, exactly 105 regulations and regulations that lack meaning were registered for this year's poll.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, there was, for example, a requirement that cars for the maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by the personality of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted with this culmination of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws sticks under the feet of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business," said the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to abolish nonsensical regulations does not sound empty.
In 2007, people were most bothered by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trades office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was the report of the Labour Office as its foreign employee a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the law on the so-called green card.
And a third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two foot weights in the office.
This was mitigated by the Ministry of Health decree this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator fell away.
The new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
A novelty in this year’s fifth year of Hospodářské noviny competitions is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition, as well as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year’s first sub-category of the main Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 competition was entered by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish on a separate article.
Although the subject of their activity differs diametrically from the other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen nationwide finalists was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
The paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of them, is taking care of its disabled employees, and therefore it has been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition ranked third in the region.
In addition, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced flexible working hours, won in the Olomouc region, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for preferentially buying from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí Region, in turn, thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by the local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Washing and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to their employees in the form of above-standard bonuses for their pension insurance.
"In our country, we give contributions for food, transport, upskilling and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, a winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered in the category of Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the question, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"A separate entry only to this competition is not possible, because it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Police arrested at the Land Fund in Pilsen during a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days arrested anti-corruption police.
The detectives deployed the irons to a local businessman in the media sphere and a real estate dealer Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the current public tender to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a particular candidate.
Luboš G. should have paid half a million crowns for it.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offense of intrigue in a public contract and in a public tender," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor's Office, adding that further details could not be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
The forty-six-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
Given the minimum amount of official information, there is only speculation about how the public tender could be influenced.
A spokeswoman for the Land Fund, Lubomír Černá, said that police officers actually arrested the separated workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
"It was a client, not our employee," she said.
According to Černá, the public tender has the correct name "Invitation to submit a tender for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and takes place if more eligible applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons under the call offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the offered claims, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," a spokeswoman for the fund explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who entered the call and because he himself is also an authorized person, because he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered those interested in the land that he would not participate in the competition.
For this, he probably collected severance pay.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had above-standard contacts at the PF in Pilsen in the past.
He was involved in the case of the former head of the PF, Václav Sankot, who was criminally prosecuted for issuing in substitute restitution the land on which the decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
At that time, Luboš G. obtained from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road to the industrial zone Borská pole was to be built.
Later, he very conveniently exchanged them with the magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a value much higher.
At that time, the town hall had to accept it, because otherwise it would have endangered the construction by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds a month
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for aqueous and sewage, heat supply and rents will grow somewhere.
From January, families will have to pull up to hundreds of crowns more per month from their wallets than they do now.
Electricity will increase by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth of you will have to pay extra for water supplies in some cities, and many will also increase the supply of central heat.
The price of electricity should cost households in flats a hundred crowns more expensive than now.
At the same time, the prices of power electricity have been reduced by all major suppliers, so a significant increase in the support of renewable energy production, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
The gas will become more expensive slightly, but at a time when people are heating the most and have the highest consumption.
It also has to count hundreds of crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive across the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January, families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns a year.
Residents of Prague, in turn, are at risk of being more than 9 percent more expensive and sewerable, if the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Prague will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the national comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, it has aqueous and sewerage price of 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices may rise significantly in 450 thousand rental apartments, where regulation has been ending since January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree to the new amount of the lease intend to put the company in court.
Regulated rents, which are paid by people in around 300 thousand apartments, could rise by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better whisky brand stolen from parents.
These are the drinks, after which the drinking most often ends in the care of doctors drunks, who are not yet fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly from the monkey in the hospital.
This is based on the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the income of children's wards of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department of the Hospital Hořovice in Central Bohemia, told Právo.
"If they can pull their dad out of the closet, it's whiskey, but the fernet and vodka prevail."
"Vodka has the advantage of pouring it into their juice and there's not that much smell of it," the chief explained.
Eva Jurinová, spokesperson for the Motol University Hospital, also agrees with him.
"It's fernet or rum most often."
"This is modern alcohol, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a plum tree that they brought from home," Ms. Jurin said.
According to the head physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers on hospital reception are a relatively common phenomenon.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances transport scattered schoolchildren from a wide area.
"One girl was lying with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with 3.5 percent of the alcohol in the blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition center in Holešovice at a dance party."
"What's interesting is that her mother didn't find it odd that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the chief said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring that is considered the main cause of the growing children's drinking.
However, according to experts, it is not possible to talk about addiction in the true sense of the word in children.
"The term alcoholic means several years of chronic alcohol dependence with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not the case with children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, a lack of family-social background is more characteristic," explained Chief Pelican.
According to a spokeswoman for Jurinová, about forty drunken children were hospitalized at a pediatric clinic in Motol until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Child drunks who take their parents after outpatient treatment or are taken home by the police do not count.
Except when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of spirits, according to Pelican, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied upon: witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"They either drink the grief of a bad report card or celebrate the beginning of the holiday season."
"Of course, I've had seven child drunks on behalf of witches at the same time," Pelican said.
A drunk who spends the night with detox under the supervision of doctors is, paradoxically, an advantage over the one who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will drive away irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They're actually better off because they have a good wake-up call after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelican admitted, adding that he sometimes spoils patients' pleasant mood at least by listing the costs that their treatment has required.
The transport by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as an educational means, when I was directly calculating to those children on the visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to earn for that one party," Pelikán added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not approach regression proceedings in which parents would enforce the cost of treatment in cases of child drunkards.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time
Two L-159 aircraft of the total five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, on Tuesday flew to the Spanish Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercise or demonstration years.
These are two-seat versions of the L-159T1, which were still operated by the Czech army and which were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
They are still preserved in Aero Vodochody and the broker of the business - Omnipol - took over them last week.
When the aircraft will physically be dispatched from Vodochod, according to Jan Pejšek from the press department of defense, it is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the shift were separated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investment by the Ministry's Ministry."
"The two-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in the current state and form," Pravu Pejšek said.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seat aircraft, because the Ministry signed a contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns for the conversion of four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the military in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has pledged to put the aircraft into the armament of some alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and they will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore the customer's business how he will implement this matter," Pejšek said.
Some time ago, the newspapers said that, for example. The Spanish army has no interest in the L-159.
The replacement of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not launch a tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
The defense leadership argued that the exchange would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have a courtroom.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in a European court because it was supposed to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by addressing one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than a ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a forename longer than a ring finger are at less risk of getting prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to a study published Wednesday by the British Cancer Journal.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men under 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly in combination with a genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burdens, Ms. Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients and, in parallel, over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a forefinger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
It was the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those who had a forefinger longer than the ring finger, this risk dropped by 33 percent, for men up to 60, the decrease was even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone matches a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone promotes growing prostate cancer.
A leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech News Agency that he was quick to know about the study, but he said it did not appear that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks lie mostly run snow, road workers in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed there on the 91st kilometre, two trucks collided on the 93rd kilometre, the accident claimed injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway on the 185th kilometre in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno on the 190th kilometre or drive through Brno and drive then on the 182nd kilometre on Kývalka.
There are several-kilometre columns.
Also on the D11 motorway is an accident, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a layer of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
The columns of cars are formed, for example, in Prosek, the clogged is also Šterboholská.
The most secure means of transport is the metro.
Trams run with delays, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, the Prague crisis staff is scheduled to meet again.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express connections due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. on Wednesday night until five in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already passable, but only with caution.
In the Vyškov region, three secondary roads are impassable, snow tongues are formed in the Brno region and snow chains are necessary to climb some roads in the higher places.
Vyškovsko was one of the most affected places.
So far, there are closed paths: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
It will be necessary to put the cutters on until they are stretched.
When they will be cleared cannot yet be estimated.
Caution should be exercised in the White Carpathians region in the Hodonín region.
On the roads, which are maintained there only by an inert sprinkle, there is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, the Czech News Agency said.
In the Czech Republic, it fell from two to ten inches of snow, the most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
About 15 inches of snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually ceasing.
U.S. troops have new "smart gun"
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is like a small super-precision gun.
Its projectiles are loaded by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special 25 mm cartridges, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, effectively act as small shells.
The charges can be programmed by them not only when hitting the target, but at any point in their ballistic track.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, and when the murderous rain of steel fragments descends on it, it can put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for the infantry to use "smart" technology.
"In principle, the soldier treats her by finding the target, sending a laser beam to determine the distance, so he gets a specified intentional point, adjusts the direction and presses the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires a missile at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said in a statement.
It will move 400 jobs
Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing office building to Marienbader-square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu will move its office from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, told the industry on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader-Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyonska Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to a spokeswoman for Fujist, another 100 jobs of the group, which are still divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The offer of the lease was said to be very attractive and the large-scale offices in Astro Park are said to be more suitable for the working way of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
The competent director, Bernd Wagner, said, "in Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection with the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important business within the region caused joy for the winners yesterday and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurt's senior economic officer, Markus Frank (CDU), said he had managed to get a "global player."
It is said to be a "fantastic expression of confidence in this location."
Fujitsu is said to be fit for the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was said to have been informed in due time by the company's management of its intention.
"Of course we have offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the troubles of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property in Marienbader-square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is about avoiding a long non-occupancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus-square, which until now was used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed building intentions of the spa town together with other buildings on Marienbader-square ten years ago.
Between the station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called city entree, which was criticized both because of the massive development of the areas that previously served as a parking lot and also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company moved into the houses of investment consultancy and rating Feri, the manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were jointly acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and after a year they were sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu-Concern from Tokyo is known as the third largest IT-provider in the world.
It offers computers and servers available to companies, and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu’s most employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, while other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the Astro Park office building, 7000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the star floor plan, which is twenty years old, is also located, among other things, the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into a tight spot.
The Amazon Internet service has shut down the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, the platform for detection, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is listed on the wanted list by Interpol, is due to refrain from following one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the country of the free," the activists told Twitter's short-range news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, the Internet company Amazon had withdrawn Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to handle a high number of access to documents when publishing secret diplomatic cables.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained to this move: "Fine - we will now spend our dollars by employing people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped using its Wikileaks servers after associates of Senator Joe Lieberman conducted the search, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defence Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, Britain's "Guardian" reported.
"I used to want Amazon to take this step sooner, given the earlier disclosures of classified information on Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has called for the use of servers in other countries to prevent the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, blatantly and recklessly, putting our national security in danger and endangering life on the entire planet," the statement said.
"No responsible firm - either American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in their efforts to expand the stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
An internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there had also been threats.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why WikiLeaks' founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to remarks from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks publication be charged and executed for the betrayal.
In Canada, one adviser to the government's chief, Stephen Harper, said on television - apparently ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target plane."
Meanwhile, a verbal firefight broke out between the White House and Assange.
A spokesman for U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if he was responsible for recently released spying calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in one person's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databanks.
The special commissioner was appointed deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary reforms in the structure" that are necessary after the publication of reports from the embassy on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are to be put in danger because of the publication on WikiLeaks.
"We have taken everything to get in touch with them," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice Cream University
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better time of year.
There is a great interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly outdated ice cream man, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio removes the ice cream from the cooling box with a squeegee, wipes it in a wafer and sells it.
To find out this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to learn even more about ice cream, you can't avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer established an ice cream university to match the Italian ideals everywhere from ice cream from its machines.
There is a huge interest in the basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses about chocolate ice cream and a practice in your own ice cream shop.
Someone longs in their Midlife-Crisis for a new career, others venture on the thin ice of their obscure desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant and would like to start something of her own after spending years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Kair.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian housewife, Julia, has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
The Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal features of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive fact is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget the Southern and patriotic icing on the cake during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a considerable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the machine with a tap and leaks out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the docent is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment?
Luciano warns to be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently equally used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold in one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will eat all the ice grains.
Certain variations of the basic mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of aromatized ingredients on you."
"You should experiment simply."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with an ice cream of a white base mass that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa to the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the participants are allowed to attend the course for ice cream machines.
Luciano will always make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't have to taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular ice cream from kiwis will be made by a group that will use more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture highlights the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra serving of sugar is needed.
Luciano removes the device by which it determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemaker thus measures the must of the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the device for the automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into a cream and cools to minus the temperature.
Despite all the automation, we can't avoid minor accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo gets himself dirty and also his colleagues from top to bottom with a fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano believes, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Reviewers in a double light
The European Food Authority Efsa is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts from Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well,” Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts for Gentechnically Altered Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have had a contract with the Ilsi Lobbying Association for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has taken a decisive part in Efsa's control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticising Then.
The Efsa Regulations are said to coincide in whole paragraphs with the Ilsi documents, bearing the manuscript of industry, which should be controlled by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has highlighted a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior executive from Efsa switched without additions or transition to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
The Radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the EU-office’s personnel interconnection with the industrial lobby, which has attracted the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MPs.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts who work for Efsa are not required to have contact with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that gentechnically altered plants in animals are currently allowed without any experiment of feeding, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know what gentechnically altered corn in the field, for example, will do,” He said.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not prove reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how could they be found?" he asks the lawsuit Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching gentechnics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical College of Zurich.
In this area, the industry, as in the USA, is now increasingly influencing or discrediting critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are no longer connected to the companies.
Studies that are critical for companies are usually not published.
“The industry is in control of security research,” Hilbeck said.
A trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening he was standing in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began to tear down a large chunk of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the railway station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The limestone of Crailsheim, a soft coarse stone that was used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43.
He's secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"It must not disappear."
It melts: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When one cut, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
A trace of the stones from Stuttgart leads into the forest near Tübingen on the former deposition of ammunition of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades with old rocks.
He bought all those that were created during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they grinded to gravel or disappeared into a depony," he says in his office, a wooden booth that was previously a watchhouse.
He tells the story that they scolded him and threatened him when in September all the newspapers said he had bought the remains of a north wing from a company that is carrying out demolition.
But he spoke for days with the S-21 opponents.
And he explained that he was not responsible for the demolition.
And when it happens, it is most reasonable when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21-adversaries each one about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also in the hope of returning it during reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest have long since sold.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from all corners and pulled away what fit in the trunk and onto the trailer.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long since turned into "walls" or as the edges of flower beds with herbs.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political nipple."
He gets into his off-road car and drives for a ride through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40000 tons of stones.
He will collect his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old-stone merchant in the country.
He's braking.
In the snow lies artistically worked sandstone.
"Once they belonged to the Marien-most in Dresden," he recounts.
The sandstone from the Elbe, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We're moving on our way up the woods.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once belonged to the blocks on the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie rocks and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, a red granit from the Sankt Blasien temple, a tuf from a hospital in Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how rocks used to be broken by hand and transported with simple hoists and bullish wagons, it becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to be crushed."
He didn't become rich, very rich, certainly not.
Today, however, the stone dealer employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassmaker and one gardener settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the one who appreciates the leftovers.
He has to go to Cologne in the foreseeable future.
There will also be rescued stones.
The Talent Fight for High-Potential
There are a lot of people at the snacks.
16 students are pushing themselves at the salmon sandwiches, tomato soups and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design to a workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are supposed to talk about the car of the future - and just to get to know Volkswagen by the way.
Many companies are trying to make the smartest heads in the race, as does VW, and bet on co-operation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as possible, recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums before they reach the labour market and be interested in others.
Since universities do not publish any lists of success of their students, companies try to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and earn them.
At TU Braunschweig, the car group is trying to win talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department is handing out pens, rubber teddy bears and plates with the VW logo.
It tells promising young talents about programs for practice, student jobs and suggests their trips to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be useful as a collaborator."
Such co-ops, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
The news is that students are so openly fought.
"Otherwise, it was more of a substantial professional project," says Selle.
The fight for recent graduates will probably be even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long crowds of applicants.
On the contrary, they must strive and try to attract a particularly high-skilled workforce.
In particular, graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will still grow.
Roman Dykta goes to hunt talent for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can also view KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, he will decide in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème of many interested parties will fly to the USA.
In the battle for High Potentials in universities, according to Dykta, there will be increasingly harsh laws.
"We want to be different from the others with our Race."
"A simple trip on a sailboat was too little for us."
Looks like the talent hunter Dykta is lucky.
"We have stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year."
“Some of them will soon be out of the field and are planning to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, mainly small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically in the labour markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"Such as on Intersolar," according to Sitha Stübe, head of the Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
The company from Bonn employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions on the company’s website.
"At the moment, it's just complicated to fill vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform that it is possible to do a practice or write a thesis."
The solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company strives to attract other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Large concerns often cannot offer this," says the head of the personal department of Stübe.
In the search for work, money does not play a major role for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in one study by the Great Place to Work.
The Institute compiles a year-long list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the personal department, Stübe, hopes that the placement will bring her points for those interested in work.
“I think that those interested are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy of a good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer goes through its own employees,” he says.
This is professionally called the internal Employer Branding, that is, the promotion of an employer in the market within their own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best envoys."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will do advertising to their employer between friends and acquaintances.
"That's like a game with a string," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
During the following years, new oil wells will not be built in front of the US-Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued an appropriate ban - and thus scrapped earlier plans definitively.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast, new drilling is still banned.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion on the "Deepwater Horizon" drill tower in April.
Before this disaster, which cost eleven employees their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the U.S., President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico to pressure the opposition and industry.
Proponents are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The focus of the criticism is Britain's energetic BP Group, which is confronted by billion-dollar requests.
The commission of inquiry, commissioned by Obama, is expected to submit results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban that has been in effect since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil concerns submitted applications for new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster by tighter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the audit office is fundamentally reformed, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish the lucrative options for tax evasion for oil and gas concerns.
The industry is now openly warning that tighter regulation will fundamentally reduce the volume of oil extracted in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industries," reads the result of the current survey in the field by the consulting firm BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance complains about industry uncertainty: “No one knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investments in new mining projects are shifting until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of gallons of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on stealing, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil mud in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading through the breasts with water surrounded by smudges: the scene looks almost nice in watery glamour with rainbow colors.
The fact that brown oil clots are swimming beneath the surface is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough garnels in containers, Esther Badom tells on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge warm area from a broken lead.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst-infested areas in the world.
On the way down the river by mangrove swamps with a lot of side tributaries, the entire range of the trigger is only noticeable.
The engine on the boat boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever plunges his hand into the water pulls out his oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves rise from the ground like black sticks of licorice, the rarely occurring palms let their leaves hang sadly.
We search in vain for flocks of birds that normally occur in humid areas: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it spreads in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a haunting silence.
“What is happening here is the ecological leadership of war,” says Celestine Akpobari sadly: “We live in a constant fear for health.”
Comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where fighting has been going on for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe flocked here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni region: while the three-sized Swiss-sized delta with more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of more than two million barrels of black gold are extracted daily, the oil fields in the Ogoni region lie ladem, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, they rise from the water of the steel structure like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees", so too tenderly called heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most to the marrow rusted.
Every now and then, such a head of the drill hole breaks, recounts Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have flowed into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that spilled into the sea near Alaska in the crash of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There are disputes over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell refers to sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental conservationists speak of cracking heads of wells and leaky lines as the root cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, US-American scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: Only a number of faults in management are said to be "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-stained open-air workshop emerges from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to their necks from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by leadership, partially arbitrarily scattered across the ground, fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
Oil heats up in a barrel over a fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the lead into the catch pot, later dripping at the end of the kerosin line and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four barrels of 300 liters a day: "We earn 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
Residents of the Delta are exploiting chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A laughing price of 40 cents of euros per liter of diesel can still overwhelm illegal producers: because they have free raw material.
It comes from "bunkers" who connect to the leadership everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost daily in the entire Niger River Delta area.
But only a negligibly small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: The largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which should include politicians and high-ranking representatives of the army, in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate over whether the residents and their interventions or the lax method of production caused the disaster is considered purely academic by the Akpobari activist.
"If oil companies had not been considered intruders, and if they had not so perfectly destroyed the life of fishermen, then there would have been neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the group's departure is considered: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will turn out to be better."
Michael is upset.
"High time to make you disappear," says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers can come at any moment."
If a special military unit finds them, they are not in danger of prison, but a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This damn thing has gotten our country to the bottom in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction error in A380 engines
The A380 clearly has a major safety flaw.
Investigators found a possible construction error during a search of the machine that made the emergency landing, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue engine manufacturers.
Qantas airbus passengers seemed to have more luck during the emergency landing in early November than previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority found a major safety flaw in its investigations on the engines of some A380 machines - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
A possible glitch would have severe consequences: one oil link could cause cracks due to wear-and-tear, the ATSB statement said in a statement published this Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is Qantas' airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a grounds for the action before the Australian Federal Court of Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and these damaged the carrier surfaces.
Rolls-Royce called the burning oil the cause of the damage.
Up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide after this event.
Australian investigators have announced they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security shortage was considered important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall will create chaos in traffic
Germany all in white: it was snowing almost all over the country overnight.
Chaos reigns on many roads, connections by trains and planes are being disrupted.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter is chilling Germany: almost the whole republic fell into snow at night in freezing temperatures - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, up to 15 inches of snow lies in some places.
There is severely limited traffic on several motorways and many roads.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in deployment, but it could not handle the newly winded snow.
There was also strong gusty winds over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy torrent on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal.
Snow drifts have caused significant problems in Saxony on highways and state roads.
According to the Meteomedia Bad Weather Bureau, the level of alarm was purple in Saxon Switzerland, the highest level ever.
In part, 30 inches of new snow fell there, strong and fresh winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and passenger cars remained there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major road problems.
On the A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
There were difficulties in Thuringia because of the snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railway, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken upper lines and turnouts.
In Saxony, remote traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, he had to stop one ICE for Munich.
165 passengers received wool blankets, food and drink on the train from firefighters and rescuers.
The snow was blowing across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information headquarters, annulled flights have already been reported from Munich.
In Frankfurt, nach Main has canceled 40 flights, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
Road maintenance is in constant commitment.
Although few passengers remained at the airport without connections, 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a truck was also caught here at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning hours.
And a 30-year-old woman died after she overturned on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg with her car.
But meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even with light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only by the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds of the strength of the storm.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could yield up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have modernized; in the meantime, bankers have once again been allowed to take on their old jobs.
Now, however, apparently, the financial concern wants the cost of renovation back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, as reported by the "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still investigating whether it is more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then rent it again," he said.
This is how the largest credit institute in Germany is again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from investors of its own fund and subsequently costly to renovate them.
According to the data, the energy reconstruction swallowed about 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper text, industry experts estimate the value of the previously renamed towers to "Greentowers" to be around 500 million euros.
A spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold again to the fund's assets or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were pronounced dead after several explosions in the mine.
It has still not been possible to rescue the dead because the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were overwhelmed in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but it did not show any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety.
After a second strong detonation, authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
It still failed to free the dead.
Now they have honored the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built to honor the memory of the buried miners, helmets, flashlights and the names of the miners.
Also pictures and personal items, like clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
On state government buildings, flags flew at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped the miners would come out of the "depths of the earth" again, New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said to participants in the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swayed in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also participated in the commemorative event.
British and South African miners were also overwhelmed during the November 19 explosion.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases are dissolved, it will begin to cool the high temperatures inside the mine, police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Does horror fit with an art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn attempts to cross the old border again with his combat epic, "Walhalla Rising."
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking one-eyed fighter (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his opponents almost with supernatural power - it sounds ideal for young men's spectators looking for bloody actions, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even rips his enemies from the belly alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as he is actually called, does not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters utter at most one or two sentences or allow themselves to be drawn to the gruesome dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and raging in the horrificly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is more ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very calm camera shots.
It's good when a film has more target groups, it's just a shame when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher," is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically resists bringing his works closer to either more humor to the mainstream or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most fans of the art cinema are apparently discouraged everywhere by splashing brains and guts.
Supporters of action movies get bored at the latest when One-Eyed go for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem and hang all eternity in the wind and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Germany "Walhalla Rising" did not get into cinemas and has now been released only on DVD.
It is a shame mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes collapsed with blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or the exact storyline, everything is the atmosphere, the feverish dream that became the film.
And that's not for the spectator of escape.
Refn doesn't give him a moment of release and slowly suffocates him with his chilling shots and grim hypnotic soundtrack, but above all the indescribable hatred that comes from the characters' hearts.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One-Eyed will retain something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all, the most one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who will become a warrior from hell over time for enemies and intermediate allies, perhaps an ambassador of the devil.
It portrays destruction, but perhaps only for the wicked.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new alerts for a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country resists expression - and will not allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the bank of the Euphrats; the nearest larger city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Office for Nuclear Energy (IAEA), her name appears when it is a reactor that was supposedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that is turning away from the current.
Based on a statement from the U.S. Foreign Secret Service of the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technique of the 1950s is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video of unfocused satellite images.
Using a computer animation, she explained where the reactor components might have been before the destruction were to be a diminished copy of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear center model.
In addition, there were still presented photos that showed the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to have been shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, it is not known much more than then, even the puzzles have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but it basically had no evidence that there was an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of the "alleged reactor," even though they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible."
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
When asked how confident he was of the reactor, a senior UN diplomat answered in the summer, saying the IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions."
The rubble of the allegedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared away by the Syrians and also properly aligned the terrain.
Still, it was found in June 2008 by the IAEA team under the leadership of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in an el-Kibar trace of uranium that was made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photos of commercial vendors through a member state from just after the attack, which should be more apt than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - possibly Israel.
The IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program and did not even build a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
This was disproved by the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, it banned inspectors from conducting a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the wreckage of a bombed-out building.
But Israel is also very silent.
"We will never comment on this," the ruling prime minister, Ehud Olmert, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation of this case has been going on for no fruit since June 2008 and is "increasing in serious trouble given the credibility of the office," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna has admitted - after all, this is a serious violation of the nuclear arms ban treaty that the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers the key to progress on the matter of the other three facilities that are supposed to be "in a functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, still exist.
The inspectors have not yet indicated which devices they are, or what their function is or why they are suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite images that is likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is apparently located inside or in the immediate vicinity of the military base - precisely for this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's approach to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that Syrians were afraid of so-called fishing - that the IAEA would be pre-sent by the U.S. to track down military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has the basis and satellite imagery that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the square at Euphrat.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said at least one facility should be "in the context of fuel production."
But there is "no evidence of sensible activities", i.e., enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be split later, there are only likely estimates for these central questions.
It is also not known whether debris that might hide important traces is kept in these three places.
As if hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the surface of the earth's cargo, no one seems to have information about where the debris has gone.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, distant and on the other side of the Euphrat lying the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector, Robert Kelley, linked him to the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from space show that after the IAEA demanded access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspicious locations and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles speak of the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for inspectors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors are.
Meanwhile, Damascus rejected the proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna were reassuring that the reactor was destroyed and that was why the thing was not burning, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies had been talking about special inspections for several months, one of the hardest means of the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce the controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken of "the possibility I'm leaning towards in the future," but he's still hesitating.
This election is a big risk: On the one hand, a majority in the IAEA's governorship is needed, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What happens if they eventually find nothing?"
Love in the time of war
Since Angelina Jolie began working on an still nameless directorial first in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, this is the love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not yet known - but even that causes restlessness.
It is said that the woman who is Muslim fell in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming from Sarajevo to Hungary moved quickly.
Meanwhile, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote through the UN-organization to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported now - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UN-organization to help refugees.
She was not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where it was raped, love stories did not take place, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims reveals enough about the script.
Its organization has therefore advised the UN-organization to help refugees release Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given the script to read, allowed filming after minor tugs in Sarajevo - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come after that.
The young author emphasizes that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains vague.
There is another version of the film circulating on the Internet, which sounds really different: the lovers knew each other before the war and will meet again when she, like a Bosnian Muslim, is introduced to a Serbian camp where he serves as a guardian.
Which really sounds different rather than "the rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie's film really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that there is pressure on her that is "not fair and based on erroneous information."
Now the hekers of Hollywood can free her: By publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
This evening is once again good for the Irish.
Not a sign of grief.
The home team dominates power significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy at the sound of loud music, stamping their feet.
Bailey-Pub in South York's Cork is boiling because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three metres into beer cups - and hit each other.
The "Beer Pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning premium and a ticket to Las Vegas for the World Championships in beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming beer game and a restrained computer scientist, it doesn't match much.
Still, the 26-year-old tries to entertain, relinquishing himself from the weighty question of what the future holds.
His plan is not a playing passion in Las Vegas, he goes to an interview in New Zealand in January.
"I have this weird feeling," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she got her dream job as an Eventmanager in an instant, maybe it's a good sign," the young man says, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two out of three Tanner siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT-advisor in London.
The boys are leaving: As with the Tanners, it looks like it looks in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish leave the country for the foreseeable future, experts at the ESRI Scientific Institute for Economics and Social Affairs predict.
They are counting on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar emigration wave as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise, which has brought great prosperity to the Irish, displeasure is now expanding again.
The economic crisis is particularly disturbing the young, educated Irish, who have so far only experienced an upswing.
The loss of employment and social descent seemed absurd in these years of boom.
Everyone needed to be, money was was wasted.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
There are many letters from readers in the Irish Times complaining: "In Ireland, everything goes downhill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, he goes away, and our country loses a whole generation."
"Please turn the last one off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black because the government is only deceiving and offers young people no prospects for the future.
"They're reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," she says.
She observes her classmates wandering from one unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers an overall service on the topic of work abroad.
“For beginners in the labour market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
What it's like to build something somewhere else has been known for six months by Sean O'Donovan.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction site in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts to repay a house loan at home.
“Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy,” he says, when, for the first time in a long time, he crosses the threshold of his own house.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm basically not in at all."
He laughs embarrassed and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, large expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house along with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100-percent funded by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions,” he says.
Is he worried that it might not go well with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, fills the hot tea and says, "I don't have children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The civil engineer doesn't like the laments he hears so often now.
“No one has to starve – our situation is not at all as dramatic as it used to be on this island.”
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back again and life passed in Ireland further, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep the future open and simply wait to see how life will develop elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him quite a bit these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
She's worried she might go wrong for a farewell party.
"Just no emotion," he says, drinking beer properly.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a departure party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The common practice of democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is considered by many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can thus monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
Two related things dominate this year's survey, which took place in September and early October.
The first is that Latin America is in a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, democracy support has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where economics was recovering after a deep decline in production last year.
But only around half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are convinced Democrats, which is pulling the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in their country in practice, this is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, this is a big increase (graph 3).
Roughly 34% said they trust the assembly in their country and 45% trust the government, again these are the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, the economic crisis undermined democracy in Latin America.
Support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission on Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latinos living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood is changing in a wide range from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a broadly accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime deteriorated.
For only the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem (see chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but that's a drop compared to 38% from last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
More massive economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the area say private business is essential for development, this percentage increased from 56% from 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage grew from 47% from last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business there), although their left-wing president Hugo Chavez expropriates many private firms.
Brazil is a country that has a leadership position in the region, as 19% of respondents mentioned (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, versus 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticised Elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti to be perfect on 28 November.
But they were far worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
The election meant filling urns and recurring votes, ballots smashed through the canals, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many moved because of the January earthquake, have wandered around trying to figure out where they can go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed fortnightlies, shouted that it was a hoax and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, have spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior U.N. official in Haiti, declared that "it was quite a good choice in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said that "they do not believe that these inconsistencies, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive fight is scheduled for January.
All electoral hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, have stepped down from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is labelled by the electoral commission for having achieved a decisive contest.
Due to the rampant cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
About 250 thousand identity cards, which are necessary for the vote, remained undivided shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And it is clear that the Haitians will do it themselves.
Tiptoe to the center
In the weeks she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, benefited from the public's sympathy, when her popularity rose from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections may depend on whether the grieving Ms Fernández gives up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these features everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued economic policy even after his wife had successfully become president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Ms Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized in the death of Mr Kirchner for a heart attack on 27. October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist have joined Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which there were slapping and accusing the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, with the president having more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth of up to 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and unionists are talking about a number that is approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleared the INDEC, a statistical agency that stepped in to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private enterprises and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was boosted by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is letting her know that she wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government formed an agreement with bondholders who had previously rejected a debt restructuring that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Now President Fernández is facing an agreement with creditor governments that are grouped at the Paris Club, to which she owes roughly $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact should not be in sight of the IMF, as is usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer-price index that will commemorate the introduction to cleaning the INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to stay in politics after the end of her term when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to win the support of a middle class that is tired of kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer holiday, which they have in March, a wave of sympathy will decline.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will be necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband has held in politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on November 27 for mayors and city councils in five city districts, which may be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that predominate to the mainland and have a strong commitment in business relations, including the agreement on partially free trade, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the mayor's five offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is inclined to make Taiwan independence more, won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party, together with the KMT, was on the city councils.
The election took place like most Taiwanese elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags with spore-strolled girls.
Part of that was a mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, wounded him and killed the spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates struggled over plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threats.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from arousing anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to reality and the realization that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, on behalf of his party, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue to pursue commercial bribes, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and advocate of clear independence.
But under Ms Tsai's leadership, a new generation has evolved that is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was proclaimed as a candidate of the DPP for president, such as Su Tseng-change, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai is telling the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "trusted alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will struggle to pick among potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for your own people.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go into the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular on unemployment and the deepening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson says he will reorganise his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan for establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "a point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy Award nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the Best New Artist category
Speech at the request of the president and people must necessarily notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who President Obama chose to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is described as one of the surprise Grammy Awards this year with a nomination for Best New Artist category.
Since Spalding was a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008 when her album "Esperanza" came out a little late, but it's in line with the rules of the Grammy, when the artist is not allowed to release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and nimble hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones recorded in 2003, the closest equivalent to a Grammy voter looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly appreciate the album Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" in the category of instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by experienced saxophonist James Moody "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Thrombone Shorty, a hoarse favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on the HBO show "Treme" was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, with the knowledge of steampunk, has gained several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large ensembles, where the competition was chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical music category
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
The leading position in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with a number of three points.
Among the nominees with a link to Southern California appeared the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles," a work that was ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Composer based in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance of awarding.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer of the year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspug, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album were given to Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castroti" listing various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra
As for the category of opera, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyric Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre;
Among the composers who are nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute episode is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for instrumental performances by soloists with the orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote this with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in recording the works of Stravinsky.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominees vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of the transition classic, she received the nomination of the soprano Jessy Norman for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula is given approval by the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics attacked the project for promoting terrorism and leading to a suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, who you remember," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who are against are only shouting loudly."
"We have really good people in our valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time it took to discuss with people who were for or against the center. These voices were evenly divided, reports Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no longer America," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Monkeys with the Statue of Liberty set in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community, numbering approximately 135 families, had been in Riverside County for years without incident, but wished for a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he rented together with the filter system manufacturer.
The new 24 943-square-foot mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, approximately three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the scope for searching for new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
The researchers discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have so far been considered and essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either thanks to phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that this is a form of truly 'alien' life," Paul C. said. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for life six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"It will start to amaze you for what is still possible," Ariel D said. Anbar from Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life outside the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life can look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on the news published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the find, prompted widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider to be 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accidental find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that the microbe, which is exposed to both elements, may be able to replace one after another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"However, the arsenic is so different that it doesn't work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic that bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in the action of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, the possibility is increased that the life-making form that uses arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic that could be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there was never an example on which this fact could be proved.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found. The Los Angeles area sheriff reported on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akits and a welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van 2006 in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs then late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not found to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two akits were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old dog Trace and a 10-month-old bitch, Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek breeds, who were planning to participate in this week's regional competitions on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unfound until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in the city this weekend to take part in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs were supposed to compete in other competitions, planned in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on nearly a month's travel by couple after dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered for the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the room window.
They also married three dogs - a boxer's puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany hound - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left it in a car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would lead them to the missing dogs. Dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether prizes would be awarded.
The lion is again ready to roar now that the restructuring of MGM is getting final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A New York federal insolvency judge on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to settle about $5bn of debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
By Thursday's decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order, MGM has no legal obstacles to relaunch Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the heads of the slimmed-down studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge suddenly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a loan of $500 million to fund new operations and MGM production.
It is now a merger with an investment bank that itself needs 75 million dollars and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve their finances, as management struggled to afford 300 million dollars a year's interest payments.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnover expert, known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and 140 creditors' studies took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay the 2 billion U.S. dollars plus the finances demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditor in late October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses in dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received US$1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's firms, which collect 4 million dollars for their services that run the company's running, will receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films coming out in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in the funding of two films, the original of which will be the book "The Hobbit," together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan of between 265 million and 275 million dollars to fund its share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, sought the possibility of merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your gift budget in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the budget for gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX rounds for 99 dollars, and one game Kinect costs the same as 10 beaded skips or approximately 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesaler Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; this year's tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to past years.
While there have been relatively fewer new toys with affiliated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries increases, as does toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases that are marked otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their tummy.
At one press, the animal gives a tone and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can’t stop.
The best choice in combining singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year I borrowed a 14-inch animatric doll on Elmo Live technology, which can play the game Simon Says and can also walk for a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel blocking.
Children test the Mickey dance instructor's toy, though their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the 80's, you might remember Alphia, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn the car ride into fun with working with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you're squinting for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with a simple use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective instruction as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years old), the first significant change to the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses the iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than a matchbox, each has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing dice in a row before time runs out; it's great for competing in improvised word-making.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
To the highest extent, two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented in the toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children from 6 to 12 years of age), which includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child receives enough credits in the Club Penguin store to any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle animal.
A little bigger than the bristle of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years), the latest in a range of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun to make a maze out of the dice and watch if he manages to find a way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off with the kitchen table and spend even some time in the mouth of our dog.
Introduction of finer police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly checking his orders and giving orders in a half-voice with military authority.
He wanted female members - China's sturdy enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their harsh interventions and fondness for violence - convey a certain impression on a cluster of bystanders.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering softly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as by ruler.
Four headgear fits perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said disdainfully.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to revive the image of urban guards in China.
One city ordered the new conscripts to have a college degree.
Guangdong province has turned grey-green uniforms into supposedly more appealing blue.
Wuhan in central China replaced the statutory views with a strong armament: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers surrounded the cart with snacks adamantly and stared at the owner until the door-to-door vendor packed up after half an hour and drove off.
Xindu, a city district with 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women who were selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a softer, female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei province beat an uninvolved spectator to death after using his cellphone to film, as they were doing during the crackdown on the protest against the landfill.
Last year, police training was underway in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrator without signs of blood.
This year, a door-to-door melon businessman in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered injuries to his left side of his brain.
One video game full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has frightened the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after further discussion on tactics.
On the paper stood "really thoroughly cleansing."
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the county advertised interest in eight new women's police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News editorial addressed the question of whether women have real duties or are merely a distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district demanded female contenders between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportions."
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials say the work is mentally too demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing," one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as if a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities, which then determine the next, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "inner quality."
Women are like floral vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city's leadership, doesn't agree much with that description.
But he pointed out that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means the question of good appearance is a matter of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked person to serve with us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps a patrol in Baoguang Square near the monastery, has 22 years, cheeks like apples and a gently shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist character, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our job is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than merely driving traders into the aisles where they can carry out their activities.
Every morning, the group stands against more than ten marketers running around on foot or on wheels, trying to sell as many dumplings and tofu bowls as possible before they are driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu when the marketer began to run, and for a time left his bike with a cart of noodles.
Police describe their duties as more monotonous than arduous.
"Every day is basically about the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in her free time.
"Big routine."
One reason is that female cops don't have the powers of their male counterparts to allow the goods to be seized by vendors.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leader.
The tendency is then to protect them from sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebel after false rumours spread that police officers had killed a vendor.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the dead of night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where they had a patrol of a female policewoman that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
Police seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute distance in front of the police officers, looking angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over 40 who already have only an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
"It's usually the public who'll start it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges involving his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure a lobby, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and that was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made it to national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "certainly pleased" with the decision that followed almost a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action with the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign would no longer be the target of the investigation and that there was no plan to bring any further charges against him in the matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department who argued that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents released in October 2009 in the New York Times said Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and support their views after employing Mr Hampton to lobby for them, so many are reported by documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was suspended from lobbying by his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in violation of the lobbying ban.
From the evidence released "it has emerged that this is a clear case of drafting a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for the ruling in Senator Ensigno's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics-specializing lawyers said the ministry was cautious in terms of political lawsuits, after a large number of setbacks, including a decision last year to suspend a lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of misconduct by the prosecutor's office.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a law group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the matter.
"It shows basically that high-ranking government officials are not covered by laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief lawyer, said in an interview that he had been called by the Justice Department's prosecutor on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with prosecutors in an effort to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in Wednesday's statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had passed on to prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable recounting the details of my discussions with the Justice Department other than that we think they've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt an investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethics group files charges that the payment of Ensign's parents to the $96,000 parents violated federal election law.
The Election Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One e-mail from December 2008 proved that after Mr. Hampton began acting as a lobbyist at the company, Mr. Ensign's senior staff - John Lopez - communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "pounding" on the Home Office regarding the subject matter being discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Transport Secretary to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to participate in a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation by his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the name of the Nevada people," she said.
Cheshire's appeal turns to Twitter
Half a dozen wrote in the courtroom.
Minutes by minute, they sent messages of gruesome testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says more than 140 000 messages on Twitter dealt with raping and tieing children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
A trial of Steven J. was held on Thursday. Hayese, who was convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, a family, and was due to hold an official termination with the death penalty for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by major reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate intrusion of information with outrageous details then introduced the jury in a decision in terms of influence by public opinion.
This claim could force judges to address the question of whether, with the advent of new technologies, not to require new rules in the courtroom as well.
"As I have experienced with this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals," Thomas J. said in a statement. Ullmann, the chief defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Judge of the trial Jon C. Blue of the State High Court briefly rejected claims regarding last week's decree and with the media being "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence to point to the jury acting under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have acknowledged that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the justice process.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sheppard herself for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, the trial was a "carnival atmosphere" during the trial because of the media.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration of the TV show and the film "The Refugee."
Some lawyers said the appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes' judgment half a century later, could be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary that determine the way communications are communicated from courtrooms, which was in the case of Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile cases, John J. said. Donohue III, a professor of legal Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report saying it was performed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr Hayes' lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the sentence.
Defense attorneys also argue, for example, that in the case of Mr. Hayes, it could be a bias when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos of the horror when choosing a jury.
Some of the judges said they were horrified by photos of the victims, which became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The lawyers say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and say the judge wrongly dismissed the judge, who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision misdirected more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think over the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the most interest.
They said in an objection to the verdict made last month that the case dominated the Connecticut news and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly stirring up the flames of emotion on the matter of the case.
"The daily rush of the media, cameras and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven and is perhaps also a nationwide rarity."
Their focus on Twitter's action is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports quoted later and, from their perspective, the judicial police should run the field of activity of other trials.
But some lawyers have demanded appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require adjustment to the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are seeking that right.
In their archives, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the matter of the judgment of Dr. Sheppard, because of the breadth of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the chasm?
After a campaign that was remarkable for its abusiveness and negativism, a small amount of courtesy emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of true cooperation between two political parties or just an illusionary moment before a quick return to the party fight in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and parliamentary leaders yielded no major discoveries on the crucial topics that must be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion dealing with the differences of opinion of two parties, as well as defining their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation has built up mutual respect for several months, which goes beyond the ideological divide that still divides the members.
And it's quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period - probing each other signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the boundaries of public opinion and voter patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting and its later evaluation by the participants were also carried out with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between the Obama and Republicans are too extensive and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the circumstances that have been going on here for the past two years.
Whether it's a matter of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both parties are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The election stirred up the emotions of the partygoers, and then they quieted down.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to discuss at the session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, either permanently or temporarily.
Similar to the likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because Republicans can't watch how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed refuse unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's talks at the White House, there is already greater optimism about a possible deal on these issues, along with ratifying the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress convenes for January.
Rather, a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing things that have to be done, psychology in a short perspective will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - to the fact that courtesy will lead them to real cooperation.
"I look at all the happenings between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events occur in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the compilation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the dangers of exaggeration, knowing they must behave according to their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These adherential lines are clear in initial responses to deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, increasing pension age and reducing spending.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in their view, to put pressure on the issue of deficit to the public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission so they can present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore fight to get as close as possible to that number.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials in the jury, who suggest that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, a small foundation or will for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between the White House and the House of Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to resolve the budget, taxes and health care, when a period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that despite the party's in the last election, most Americans want to continue to see two parties working together.
If it could be directed to the heel, as it did in 1995, then both sides will be very closely monitoring the public's reactions.
Whoever threatens to lower the vote is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
That can be an optimistic view of the matter.
Partying and directing are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a larger ideological gap has been created between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the more important 2012 election.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common groundwork on issues that still divide them.
The leaked U.S. documentary portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it continues with part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in the February records.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings to help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal trades, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "the vertical of office" - will take its own when the money begins to move up the ladder.
The entry, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was released on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and blames him for a large part in corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in purification.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have for many years consistently denied corruption charges, and won several lawsuits for perjury for such allegations.
In September, he said on a Russian television station when he was asked about the proven testimony of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap."
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be a vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of diplomats from foreign countries doing so.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its links with the criminal elements some have led to it calling it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than as a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of criminals and the mafia that literally means 'roof' or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified and a three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Home Office and the militia are in second degree."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It's an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas because the city does not provide some services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest firms and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "Owners of shops in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so on course."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is comprehensive, protection itself can already have difficulties; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay fast enough, their trades close under different pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but admitted he has made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, possibly packed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's research team, said in a recent interview.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because in Russia there are no longer political classes."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he said.
The Indem estimates that nationally, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked from the least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the report of the U.S. Embassy, which appeared in Moscow only in the late evening, certainly did not provoke enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov may be accused of Moscow's shortcomings may be, may be a possibility for Kremlin to argue on the matter of solving the problem.
Speaking to CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks may have been fakes and reacted angrily to a statement that U.S. diplomats call him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it is about our mutual synergy, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such coercion, you understand, so unethically."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to come to terms with past
In a spore-lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the school's principal, Anlong Veng High School, reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander in this remote possession of the Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge relinquished the government, long-standing loyalty is also broken up in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Truth Forum and Reconciliation were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining to children for the first time the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court jointly infused the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, a sentence of a former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With every such advance, there was growing unrest among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates reconciliation efforts and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
"There is a grudge and fear among the former Khmer Rouges, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, from illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the regime's remnants and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sara managed guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace deal sponsored by the UN, the country was led to the first democratic election in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began moving on to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured by government forces in the non-Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters sank into an ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically recall the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have retained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, like unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which is run by public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised without any idea of making a deal."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before he settled down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"That Mok has supported everyone."
"But now life is hard, because we have to secure everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sara and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute senior officials and people responsible for crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was little to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation centered on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project on which thousands of forced workers were likely to have perished.
The recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in a field to her wooden cottage on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared across the arid grasses, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her in, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court sought other suspects, although experts and historians disagreed.
"Cambodia has to dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation in the Khmer circumstances means sticking together broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center has released the first textbook approved by the Khmer Rouge government, it has 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the history textbook of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties about the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew little detail about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have influence, he further said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a strong charm here.
Up in the mountains of the Dangrek Mountains, the path is overgrown with weeds and emptied with discarded plastic bags that lead to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cellphone saleswoman on the side of the road said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at that location.
"But he has a strong spirit, many locals walk around and pray to him," she said.
The Nuom Sothea's birthday was over and she planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to appear to be its stockpile of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was released in a joint statement, issued after a security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has for years sought to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have encountered a stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a couple of classified operations had been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This has paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - around 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The deal proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was decommissioned.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent 2012 summit.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place for the nuclear safety summit2012."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety group.
Clinton called the deal a "very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity...We're not going to make dirty bombs and we're not going to sell it to anyone either."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials announced.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was concluded on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the program, most of it on the delivery to a Belarusian research institute less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and controlled on the basis of trust," which led to an agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study of non-proliferation this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, seek to remove its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not do expensive with CIA flights
The Spanish government did not do expensive about CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and members of Al-Qaid to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, as the United States envoy to Madrid expressed in his telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks daily El País, which also states that the then first deputy prime minister, María Teresa Fernández de la Veg, asked that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show that she has proper supervision of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace."
In June 2006, following a Communication from the Council of Europe in which a dozen states, including Spain, were accused of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Veg.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication "extricated the Zapatera government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Veg stressed that Spain has no problem with the flights of the secret services through its territory.
"They simply want to be informed" so that they are not "caught unprepared," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also suggested to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter as low as possible, but by the fact that this matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence."
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that, as far as it relates to him, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to demand the declassification of documents from the National Secret Service Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information," the embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern more because of "the apparent coordination between a Spanish judge and German prosecutors" than because of the declassification of information by the CNI or the Defense Department.
"This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly among governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch of U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they think appropriate," he has already instructed his co-workers "to avoid angry comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP) in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that Partido Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indication that the Zapater government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the U.S. government.”
The admitted mother-murderer complained on the network on maternal "worry"
The young woman spoke of the baby when it was already dead, and she had her blog: "Terror after galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
With this nickname, which she has used since she was a child, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which the ABC newspaper reconstructs with the help of the testimony of its family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia joined the relationship with industrialist Ivan Túnez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma to visit her for a week.
However, it is clear from the content of her communication that the relationship broke up.
In March 2008, she's alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is some kind of upset that I left for work."
"When I told him, he thought it was good, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where to send your baby."
He complains: "If he doesn't like me to leave the baby with my mother, I'll take it when I get back," he claims.
In May, he talks about his return to his residence: "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to be until 19, because 20. I have to go for work so I don't lose that job".
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son to himself.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, that is, with me, and it's never gonna happen again in my life that I'm going to leave him with someone else but my mother," a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There's another post in July.
When he taps this report, it is believed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably was murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"César is satisfied on the one hand, but he is not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me, and he quite likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Majorca.
"He's going to go there (son) to summer school, so I'm going to save a little money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you what videos to email, look what he wants, he'll meet me, sex is needed."
The 30th next message: "The boy is well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one message about Víctor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet are Monica's posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she had the called "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Terror after Galician (motto) ".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
She doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The defense attorney, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one in any way."
She had previously admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bath and placed his body in a suitcase.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric examination.
The People's Party would win 4 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and the PSC would lose 9 seats
with the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main say at the town halls in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes received and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia) already has a given idea of a general election, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in the national elections is usually one such compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610,473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, that figure was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) received 384.091 votes.
If this tendency of increase, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the voters of the PP, is maintained, the analysts of this party calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could receive 12 deputies in the Chamber of Deputies compared to the current 8, the CiU party (Convergencia i Unió, Czech Shoda and the Union) would also lose 4 seats (now it has at least 5 seats)
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of paramount importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the People's Party, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV would still have one mandate, possibly winning one more.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the nearest rendezvous will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of municipal elections, where the People's Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of the rule of the Socialists in the four major provincial cities and also on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the people's people agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose the town halls in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona council - since a minimum of 5% of the vote needs to be won.
The PP party has increased the number of votes received in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP received only 500 more votes than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The People's Republic also gained at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
Currently, the PP has a representation at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to the Al Qaeda organization
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of the organization Al Qaeda, among which were also "Tigers of the Liberation of Tamil Elam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", while the second named group was the author of the assassinations in Bombay
The Interior Ministry attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure, through Operation Kampai, the weakening of the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level and "limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that during the two years it was active in Catalonia, the cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then counterfeited and then delivered to groups that make up the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their "fighters" could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active one that the jihad network in Europe had, and therefore other European police units participated in these investigations in addition to the Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that in the coming days there will be no similar interventions in other European countries as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) another developed in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Eh
It was these men who managed a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was disposed of in 2009, mainly stole from tourists passports that met the demands of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, had to be valid for several years and be without marked visas.
The investigative documents stress that no facts are yet known to link the detainees from Catalonia to the Mumbai assassination, even though the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba," was supposed to be one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by the transfer agency, which were "inserted" to buy cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) is demanding Masa to halt the fiscal deal
The chair of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity yesterday to present personally to Arturo Mas his terms, under which she is willing to support his introduction to the office of President Generalitat; these conditions are identical to those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and renounce risky businesses such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party came to the meeting with Arthur Mas with the certainty of 18 seats received in last Sunday's elections, which is a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations forming the opposition to abstain from voting on his appointment to take office.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that nationalists would like to maintain in the House when the general elections are held, but so far the talks conducted by Mas and the rest of the political leaders are held in the Catalan spirit.
As for the president of the PP to win her support for her taking office, she will "have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches," as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one from the Basque Country - that the CiU leader even wanted to let the referendum vote on.
Both leaders would like to slim down the overwhelmed political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masa's appointment will be addressed within the PP's Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat parties.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will meet today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of a "lack of measures"
The Olot Center's performances do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe what damages caused the institution of criminal behavior of Joan Villa Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors he had in his care.
The director of this retirement home, Joan Sala, arrived accompanied by the facility's lawyer, attorney Joan Canada, and announced that "the wish of La Caritat's home would be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the killing, but "legality and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities."
In addition to the damage to the reputation that this institution may suffer due to the fact that it did not detect the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the great threat to the home of La Caritat is now the requirements for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the elderly's home's clients, suspecting that in many cases no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but that - due to the age and ill health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme yesterday, stressing that "the lack of measures could in no way have been the cause of what happened."
La Caritat's attorney added that "there are no indications in the case that, apart from his own accused, any third person would commit misconduct."
The man nicknamed now "The Angel of Death" admitted 11 deaths yesterday, specifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, death caused too much insulin dose, unlike the first case of using a mixture of soothing pills.
Director La Caritat said it was complicated to control the approach of staff to medication.
Insulin and a cocktail of sedatives were probably in six cases out of nine means of taking this caregiver to kill patients in their quest to relieve their suffering.
However, it is only the analyses that are currently underway in the laboratory that should show whether the Villa does not lie and actually sought a less cruel death for its first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by administering lye, as he has already admitted in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17. October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe the health claims and do not rule out that the number of those killed may be higher than what he confessed to, and justify their behaviour in the various versions given by Vila to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it became clear that he had killed eight people.
That's why they say they want to be available to the judiciary in order to illuminate the full extent of the matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of European Central Bank president Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to respond."
The marginal differentials closed with strength and shares fell more than 5% on European banks.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be wrong - the euro has just risen above critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market, which, although there is a decline, is recovering - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us as saying to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy the national debt for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity rates within the period, leaving unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity level of forecasts "at least until March" and adhere to a three-month licitation with unlimited access to the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and that they will even announce its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations created, it will create a reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to withdraw the liquidity rate blindly, God with us!
It was the same at the convention in May, where they claimed they didn't even consider buying bonds, and there was a collapse of the markets - tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armoured fist announced on Monday, and on Wednesday, it said it had already bought many, prompting another market collapse.
Yesterday's licensing of bills of exchange for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared with 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell 30 points lower, reflecting the change in the mood in the market, which occurred after the words of Trichet.
in Ireland, the figures have been published representing the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent around 10,000 million on short-term securities and another potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after not revealing the problem with stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the approval of the new budget by parliament and still does not have enough support, so there continues to be uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has tempered the tone of her speech to ease tensions in her face for the next EU leaders meeting on December 14, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would rather be Beethoven's Ode to joy.
In Spain yesterday, the prime minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action that will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, measures to revive employment - in the ears of investors it sounds like Four Seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose 4.5%, twice that of other European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond license that will be advantaged by the effect of Trichet, which we hope will be in great demand for it, which will help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capability.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - there's 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would close to us sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not only to be that, but also to dream of it."
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will challenge the meeting of the company Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the Álvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not quieting.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, comes to mind after taking it as "completely insignificant," the legal conduct of El Enebro planned for this month 16 and the required five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize themselves with the help of the administrative authorities of the board of directors of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José fine-tune the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the domination of part of society.
The founder of the largest corporate service holding does not appear willing to ease in his dispute over membership in the ruling bodies of the El Enebro Group.
from its administrative committee was deposed five of their seven descendants, who were appointed leaders during the meeting of shareholders on 18 January this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register.
The court hearing of the El Enebro group, scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by a Commercial Court No. 2 official in Madrid, restored the thunder in the womb of the Álvarez family again.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal remedy guaranteed by the convening of the commission until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Martha and Elvarez’s Mezquirizs is considered by David Álvarez to be “a desperate means of his five children serving with the help of judicial deceit and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the January 18 negotiations, which were completely invalid.”
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal contest of this act as "completely insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried without success to bring the trial to convene a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group owning, in addition to other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Álvarez 100% of capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires a right of use to 51% of capital.
This matter is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when hearing the question of judicial assault. The date of this trial has not yet been determined.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes real-time improvements in vehicles.
Since Red Bull invaded the 2004 Formula One series, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterised by surprise and success.
Initially, no one took too seriously the possibilities of this newcomer team, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on Ferrari's Fernando Alonso triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula 1 - the "secret weapon" that the multi-ethnic Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating the marches that the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very distant automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for devices with high accuracy.
It aims to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM has facilitated the development of the Canon camera, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software device has enabled the Red Bull team to carry out “in a few hours, in near-real time” modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements over a period.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology are working to analyze and design each type of modification of racing vehicles.
A senior executive from Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical convenience is the amount of 40 million dollars representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can issue for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant to design and manufacture its racing cars, about 50 km from London.
These are two buildings that are restricted from entry to visits - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a “big secret.”
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull hero is without a doubt the freshman champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, behind the immense technological means that the brand of energy drinks put into its participation in the racing circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey argues that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the 50% victory and the rest was a credit to the riders.
At present, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the success of 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology because they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in partnership with its business partner Pont Reyes, yesterday inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 sqm, which this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrer, the vice president of HP in Spain, has launched a newly converted store for the Greenland-based Gran Vía, which has been partnered with by HP for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal where other stores would be opened, however she admitted that Madrid could be one of the following venues.
Herrero, who also heads HP's personnel systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will still be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises on the exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be tried interactively) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also concerned with providing staff for stores.
Helena Herrerová denied that it was franchising, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging."
The trade in Barcelona is part of a world-class pilot pioneering program to address any problems with computer devices under warranty.
Online service is connected to the technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Then we will be able to solve problems within 10 minutes, which otherwise can take up to two days."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contractual technical assistance services," Helena Herrerová said yesterday.
Sabadell is betting that he will "steal" a million clients to his competitors within three years
More optimistic than other bosses, the bank's delegated board member, Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be challenging for the bank but rejects the new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of a passive war.
Nevertheless, it expects to reduce interest rates, which will try to compensate by discounting bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to acquire a million private clients within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years and the power to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with effect for three years.
The aim is, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public assistance in FROB, to gain market share by catching a million new private clients - 700,000, respectively, if those who possibly leave the bank - because until now, even the institute has more of a pampered small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% when it comes to private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce the costs, the challenges of which will be demonstrated by the bank when it presents the results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme this year, set out four years ago, though it was originally for three years, but the market situation required expansion for another period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important."
Indeed, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain will be "tedious."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although he believes that a passive war - which reduces margins - is receding, the price of surcharges for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their issuance to receive liquidity are already shifting to credit prices, thus offsetting margin reductions.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a coercive factor on loans".
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the tendency in banking "now is to reduce commissions," but there is a "competitive framework."
The Sabadell Bank’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain does he assure that in Spain "they will be demanded larger sizes."
"Next year there will be no stone left on the stone," he assured.
It confirms that the needs of capital are "much reduced" and does not exclude that a Spanish institution will enter among the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can substitute the collection of funds in the market before the new capital measure.
After assurances that Sabadell may survive the temporary close of markets, it continues to be a serious problem what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, short-term funding can be obtained using repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA eliminates the next wave of mergers of savings banks
CECA's chief executive rejected yesterday that another wave of savings bank mergers was to be created, and again insisted on the speed with which the sector's reorganisation is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings association process started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, the director-general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA) José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled yesterday that a new wave of these operations should be created.
"I believe that most mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening is conventions."
"The majority is completely carried out; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which cooperated very well in this matter," the director said.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting, the Association of Aragon Leaders and Executive Officials Olavarrieta recounted that the concentration process is taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the installments, which, not now, appeared in the trade plans with the Spanish National Bank," he stressed.
"To go from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make these larger and therefore in accordance with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we must be on deadline before the end of the year."
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday assured that Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and has attributed "a lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks and the system that has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and which continues at "the highest possible speed."
He also recalled that Spanish banking came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the red German line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private brokering agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for unemployed people without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic control), the administrator of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel over her responsibility to start the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is supposed to be, which alludes to the idea of following the old traditions held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, there is speculation in Germany about three possible routes out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, while southern countries would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the mark - though it may now appear like a sci-fi, this version has widespread public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to Germany's proposals, is the recast of the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigour, fines for guilty states, possible postponement of payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for the quizzes now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission incited deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform from its sleeve to prevent it from 2016.
This was the first sign of the contradiction between what Germany considered to be correct (the fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country when Merkel was painfully protracting the decision to save Greece.
Already then, it was the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to Greece's rescue.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel has reappeared with a clear position when she demanded to reform the European Union conventions so that a Member State can be rescued while making sure that private creditors are obliged to bear some of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although in somewhat mitigated form, has been approved, and we should monitor the reform process of the Union within the next few months, which should allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has established a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
And he tells us all that, although now measures need to be taken that he seems to disagree with too much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which states infringing rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is suggesting that we must take a strict path of growth with an increase in savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
A different option based on debt and building, with huge balance of payments gaps, which has reigned in the years of Spain's growth boom, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we would have made a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong about ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will replace more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this, too, and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting with the big businesses of last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) gives an idea that despite critics in Merkel's address, the path has opened the way for the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has set is there, and it does not appear to want to move it.
And from the possibilities that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not very serious countries can be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumvention of the rules
The tricks, shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax, show a wit not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged suspension of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on November 23 caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this was unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether, in turn, UEFA should not punish both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team clearly won) the players named one by one deliberately wasted time when the foul was supposed to be played to provoke the judge, and he showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in their group in the lead - and will be able, stripped of their cards, to continue to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA disciplinary committee gave coach Jose Mourinho a two-match penalty and the guilty players were given a monetary penalty.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, that is, rules that are unwritten, but follow.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that it was attended by the Real Madrid team (which boasts a nobleness and honor in its anthem, and which already fined its players for similar actions), and, it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinho, which thus adds another episode to its long history of the comedian and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of conduct, which is not explicitly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is a circumvention of the law in these deeds; these are indeed actions respecting sporting rules, the meaning of which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is discussed what type of damage such acts cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the requirements of sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opponents, which was not violated in these cases, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these essentials characterizing a clean game is to avoid players having an advantage over the opponent's team due to their offense - which also did not happen here.
Thus, paradoxical at the event of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as a trickery or circumvention of the law, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanction, but this behavior should have been as evident as possible in order to receive the punishment.
They waited and were happy to get the punishment.
The next question, however, is what advantage the culprits of their intentional offense will have.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that there will be no benefit in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And even that is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, i.e. at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition to this action, the players will take the penalty, and will go to the second round of cards, in which one card less than in the first round is enough to exclude.
So how the rounds will continue will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow to get maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid the punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or running away from punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention of the rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions were transmitted to their provocation from the management.
The damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
The fight of offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar's dictation will concentrate an avalanche of bookings this year for December 16 and 17.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid for by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or the lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis have resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, the interviewed entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on Friday) concentrated the request for a week from December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for the days at peak time (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been the case since 2008, when the skinny years began, there are many firms that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon tradition, many employees pay for their spending at parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the edge of tolerability, according to the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
A representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities at this time does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People change their minds before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but when it comes to the topic of prices, they're cautious," he adds.
Shops will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a reasonable price," he says, recalling that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down a degree and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
The survey at various facilities shows that the biggest onslaught of booking requests is for the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real boom in bookings for this Friday, with the most requirements being for spending up to 30 euros, which have been adapted by the menus offered, the total prices of which are between 25 and 30 euros.
In another major company, Andilana, comprising 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the peculiarity of this year's calendar to more early bookings, since the beginning of November.
"We have made it both possible and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, from which everyone should choose, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 businesses, they remain optimistic after seeing a rise in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
The company's sources stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as pre-Christmas celebrations among friends will be held.
to their six group menus added the Christmas menu, with a budget of 30 euros or more, because compared to last year, they saw a tendency to spend 10% more guests in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They have also noted that there are already companies that are again inviting their employees, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Fecasarm's vice president (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes he is starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that the number of bookings has "revived" although clients "contract to the maximum."
This impression did not give way even during the Christmas celebrations, whether it applies, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program spawns great unrest in U.S
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a "faster pace than any other country."
WikiLeaks documents confirm links between Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department published by WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that raises Pakistan's nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to clarifying and significant details that offer about the content of the communication and ideas of the representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "is on the decline" and that this unstable Asian country is producing "more nuclear weapons than any other state."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but stored after works, in order to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - represents one of Washington's main reasons for the vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, in one report before a visit by then-national security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer observed only by the U.S., but also by Russia, as a spreading and representing reason to be on the lookout.
“Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or guided missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev, an expert from the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation released by Julian Assange is the increasingly lower cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistani production of these weapons.
A dispatch issued by the embassy in May that qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," he argues: "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unresponsive or are rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, said that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other state in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to "very well" clarify during a visit by the army chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani military must put an end to the tacit support of terrorist groups."
The Hunt for the Head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high-ranking worker responsible for fighting terrorism to avoid new leaks of information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to trace and determine where Assange could be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary challenge," the so-called red notice, to "localize and track the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the sexual abuse charges the Australian is facing in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks lawyer Mark Stephens assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
It was November 20 when a corps of international police based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have guidelines to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose a temporary link to him and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person to be affected by the red appeal, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the red notice to be allowing arrests to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when states have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
The move scandalized Assenge's attorneys, who published a writing yesterday, where they declare that Wikileaks' thirty-nine-year-old founder has shown a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities using videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovich Beriya, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt and not a legal pursuit," the letter states.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor of Time magazine - in that interview he demanded the resignation of Secretary of State of the United States Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for orders to U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations and violate international conventions that the United States has signed, she should step down.”
His view was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has instructed the high-ranking worker responsible for fighting terrorism, Russell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, which will chair the House National Security Committee in the Lower House from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "so that anyone who would financially contribute or otherwise provide assistance can intervene and prosecute them."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Assange should "be killed," which he subsequently had to dismiss.
"Obama should put a reward on it or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former Arkansas governor and a possible candidate for president.
“Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak of information has committed treason, and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” he said
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC by "blinking" at Caroda supporter
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote to remain.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe for fighting the already multiple internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the vote.
The party chairman is aware that his gesture of resignation seems inadequate to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader himself, and that he absolutely cannot worry him about the kind he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to win new critics through blinking, which will help him to defend himself into municipal elections.
At first, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to secretly speak out about his remaining in office.
With the help of ballots, not by raising your hand.
If they want to give the supporters of Carodo a criminal vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splitting and subjugating his person.
in several interviews, he argued that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentages, that he also would not be a good result "after Bulgaria."
Supporters of Caroda are demanding more from the chairman than making his office available - which they see as a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest body at the conventions.
But given that they don't have a sufficient majority to enforce their resignations, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
Because of this, they expect to participate in the drafting of a document on strategic reorientation, which the leadership will give to the National Council to vote on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for promising to move Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said that "much voice" was damaging stability, and that his goal was for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, it seems like a characteristic article that current adviser Josep Huguet has signed on his blog.
After taking into account Puigcercós' ideologue, this innovation adviser took the matter, saying the leader would be confirmed by "exchange for several goals."
And he named five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means also including new faces who are from the sector inclined to Carodo.
The second goal can be a big novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely put an end to meetings as a mechanism of operation.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes in order to hold congresses through delegates selected by the vote.
The end of the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercós' team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, a convulsive assembly of 2008 decided that the meeting must be considered at a special congress on the reforms of the statutes.
This matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this matter.
Now, without the lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to deal with this matter again and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered for the month of November; 390 for 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decline of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders stand out the cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, Mexico has a total of 390 killings, possibly linked to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a wound from grace to the head, and had her hands and legs handcuffed by a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the luggage compartment of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, in Naucalpan County.
Early on Thursday, November 4, co-operatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal bullets into a chest near the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the section of Villa Guerrero County.
Next to the body was a message signed probably by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a fifty-year-old man was murdered in Nezahualcoyotl by eight shots after he walked out of his house and wanted to start collecting trash.
On November 7th, two 30-year-old victims were killed in a bullet in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, a body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the El Naranjo colony, and a cartridge of a caliber 25 was found under the body.
in Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewage canal in the Playa Golondrina colony.
The rescue services conducted a thorough search for other parts of him, but did not find them.
Residents of Thepotzotlan reported finding the body with their hands tied backwards and wrapped their heads around Pen Colorado.
The man had a blow from a firearm on the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was announced, and the victims were also found with death threats.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes La Paz district.
in a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bedding in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, a man was found killed in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet that was preliminarily identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by the killers near his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no signs of life was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuaulla with two wounds to the back of the neck.
A tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death") and necklaces with her likeness were discovered on the woman's skin.
At the end of the month, a man's body was found in the village of Zinacantepec in a car with at least a third gunshot wound and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads wrapped in tape were found, and a message was also found, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
in Ecatepec, two bodies were found that carried the marks after torture and had her limbs tied, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl were found.
The first was beheaded and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and left with a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic container in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents found a note with a message.
China adheres to its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
At the UN climate change conference, the country's representative, COP16, assured that its country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and has specified that it insists on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative, assured at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Suu Wei assured that his country had made immense efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
But he made it clear that China would not change its goals and would continue to work on the matter with the international community.
He reported that China's strategy on climate change issues is divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
On all of these points, they have already made progress, which include last year's approval of the new Energy Act, which includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further stressed that in China, federal authorities cooperated in a coordinated manner with provincial and local authorities to achieve their energy-saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.
Furthermore, he said, various multi-year plans have been implemented or have already been finalised, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
For example, it is, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been introduced over the past five years, and which has received investment from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also running, as well as the project of replacing fluorescent lamps with energy-saving bulbs and the project of mitigation and adaptation, he specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's expert adviser on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than widely thought.
For example, he recounted, greenhouse gas emissions per capita account for 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historic share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, increasing its energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Enacted the Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional) party said that the former chairman of the party is entitled to demand his right with the National Order Commission.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos has been enacted, and that the former chairman of that party is entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and demand his right.
In an interview taken before the objection was raised by the governor of the state, Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espino is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Riot Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the National Council's Order Commission to be a decision made by a competent body," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she has never been at the negotiating table for the alliance's presiding candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that PAN will come out of the internal elections held on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (the 2012 Alliance) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The PAN chairman said that 71 years of dialogue stood behind his party, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us," he added.
He said the committee could without question elect the best chairman or chairwoman PAN deserves for the next three years, so he will hand over the relay to "whom the committee will appoint."
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, to any of the five I will proudly hand over the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the rise the party saw in the last election of July will be reflected in future competitions, though "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent a flag and will be the subject of observation across the country, as "many expectations and desires are put into them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to these expectations."
When we asked him about the critics of President Felipe Calderón by the party PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institutional) because of his speeches within the four years he governs, César Nava called on PRI members to think about the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRIs believe that the governments of Zedill and Salinas were better than the rule of Fox and Claderón, let them start defending them, let them come out of their shell.”
He said that the head of the federal executive had the right to express himself as he had done during a speech in the National Auditorium, since no gag or censorship was used in that country.
Obama promotes law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you believe that the approval of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and make sure they pass this bill," the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today, by posting on his personal Twitter account, joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
“If you think the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and make sure they pass this bill.”
His short report draws attention to an internet link to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the bill is approaching.
“Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard.”
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block approval for any bill unless the Bush-era tax cut and government funding were approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about Republican blocking the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal topic was resolved, a calendar could be compiled for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement on this issue at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of the other matters.”
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would be asking for a "vote to close the discussion" on the Dream Act, so a motion to legalize students without documents could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although more likely is next week.
The Senatorial Approval of the Dream Act, or the "U.S. Dream" Act, would legalize roughly 800 thousand young people who reached the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country during the past five years and were admitted to a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of his supporters are carrying out intense agitation to ensure the bill is passed.
The Democrats, whose majority the Dream Act supports, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has expressed his support for the bill.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act project need to get several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most are Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who supplemented Senator Melo Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it again next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has yet to comment at the moment.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature, they put their finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put your finger in the wound" is similar to the Czech "hit the nail on the head)
The second round of the cycle of Pleasure of Language was a promenade where participants performed a literary gala performance
"I understand that with Sex in language, but... A finger to the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of the Pleasure of Language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair, they devoted themselves to the topic of Sex in the language at the round table, she explained).
The finger "brings us to the narrows" was carried out sweetly by an Argentine writer to an audience, composed mostly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to listen to this roundtable debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luisa Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read the text she dedicated to Gonzal Celorio, and which Schultz then described as a great short story, in which Luisa performed in the first person as the protagonist, who, in search of knowledge, what is the "blow" she goes from the doctor to the doctor, from whom she does not get answers, although the trace of the same story is.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "patience is not my strong suit, maybe it will be my wound."
Finally, after frustrating with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound was not a scientific term, he is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it truly open and the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she managed to learn only so much about the wound that it was truly open and that it did not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
The Nicaracist Sergio Ramírez also spoke out with a delightful narrative, which he called Praise of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but appears at one point.
with elements of magical realism, she tells of a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or corrected the honesty lost by a virgin, this narrative, which was then turned to be spoken by America, a great novel in which his own chroniclers, who told him from the beginning, were not missing, and Bernal Díaz del Castillo is quoted here, criticizing the exaggeration of the captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (writers), mocked us with a fake testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in other ways it never managed to tell the story of America with the kind of imagination that lacked even shame."
However, he emphasized, "they are fools and liars who have more imagination" and just where reality and lies come, where it is no longer known what of the story belongs to one group and what to another, fictional literature reaches its peak.
He calls it a “Cervant tradition.”
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Montero emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her discussion Finger into the Wound allowed.
The Cuban-portoric writer pointed her finger at the major blow of social violence that is going through her country - and shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs make a quiet compromise that is of course not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical response."
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "on this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer."
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control of consciousness that is brimming with dogmatism, it is forgotten that "there is a small no behind every acquiescence, and behind every denial is also a small yes."
“In order to be the masters of our thoughts and reality, we must color: and coloring it means putting our finger in the wound many times and bothering those individuals who are much more comfortable, because thinking in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without color, and to bother also the authorities that prefer this black-and-white world,” he said, uttering to support the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has experienced both good and bad during his career, but he has already achieved three occasions on the decisive series.
In the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, two different styles characterized with their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has been able to achieve a decisive series on three occasions, but until now he has left with the unsuccessful, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed behind the winner and quaintly played with the same team the following final.
The Sandist strategist reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament when he had the reins of the club Morelia, with whom he succumbed to a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the tournament Clausura 2003 again progressed to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the team Rayados.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicenenario 2010, again against the "Devils" of Toluka, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against the "Smothers" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca) after 210 minutes of play indecisive 2-2, after a series of penalty shots he finally got a three-on-one advantage and had two opportunities
Rubén has already lost two finals against the "Red Devils" from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and thus be able to celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the stats, this is for the club, for the passion that I'm indebted to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
In living memory, he has a previous final, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that in this we have learned our lesson until the match is over, we cannot celebrate".
He is not concerned that this series could decide in criminal shootings, he believes his players: "You never try to come to a series of penalty kicks, you try to end in a normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and it is necessary to be ready for it, in the previous tournament we were ready, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety that we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it."
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the other and taste the glory that the titles bring for the first time.
The United States is changing the rules for granting visas
People will have to turn to the Visa Service Centers before interviewing the Consular Department; the costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
From January 10, 2011, the visa process will change to the United States Embassy and Consulates.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centres (ASC in English) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The staff from the ASC will remove the applicant’s biometric information and will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer necessary to pay the fee for the appointment, the second for the processing of the application and another for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee, which shall cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with an application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and fingerprints will be taken away.
Since biometric information will be taken away in the ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra 26-dollar service fee.

NASA announces discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 a.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that addresses the study of the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalists, NASA assured that it would present "a discovery that will break in the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and who could represent the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemist National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is precisely this ability that increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is a different, second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the true reach of the discoveries at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who research Titan (Saturn's largest moon) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón breed opposition "block"
Reforms to the Constitutional Congress Act lead to the arrival of "bipartism," they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period was not even started when the opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by members of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democratica, Czech "The Party of the Democratic Revolution"), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Partis of Labour"), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda": the arrival of "bipartism" in the House.
Before the start of the session at the opening of the 60th parliamentary term Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo "sin" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, because it decommissions them.
With this reform, they repeated, begins "bapartism" because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Briton of the PAN (Partido Acción, the Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo said these reforms institutionally constitute political marginality at the initiative of the PRI (Partido Revolutionario Institutional) and PAN.
He specified that over the next few days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on the political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjected to these two parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
“When the (opposition coalition) has come here, I’m looking at it because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the willingness to consider the opinion of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said they agree with the PRD, PT and Patrón and will therefore form a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, for Congress, after being monopolistic, to be now "duopole."
The aspiration for law reform is not to have endless bipartism in Congress.
The group begins with five lawmakers, and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, according to Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that currently Congress has become the "prey" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It was previously controlled by only one side, today it is divided by two."
Patrón Montalvo demanded that the personality of the Member be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"To keep the five Members, who are likely to be nine, but who are now seeing us at five, are out of place because of the vaulted agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that we stand outside the reform they have made and agreed to, and we do not agree with this reform."
Another 200 thousand pesos for "supplier" is issued
The town hall in Mazatlán will pay another cheque discussed to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial.
Another check for a little more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the town hall by Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
The amount paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying the electromaterial will climb to 1.200,000 pesos.
According to the Town Hall's transparency page, this last cheque number 9258447 was sent on November 16 this year, was issued to a sum of 200.144.56 pesos and, as its subject matter, was listed "compensation of outstanding payments."
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay another amount to this supplier, which was monitored by the High State Audit Office for sales at high prices.
What was not said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many more cheques will be sent in favor of Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers, is paid to her," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two days 15. October, 19. October, 29. October and this last November 16.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Letter, as the law states in the case of companies examined by the High State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasurer assured that it did not use the services of the town hall supplier again.
in the previous period, after 25. July, the Noroeste newspaper published a review of the cheques issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and 9. July 2010, during Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez's three-year term, the city of Camach Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada meeting in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to the depression at the Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad condition, and thus do not show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Zona Dorada region, reminded that they repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and the bad things that tourists find here, in order to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He stated that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk around and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to shut down a business for a day, and they have no idea about sales that are leaking, otherwise they wouldn’t have dealt with these matters for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by City Hall.
"The city hall will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to devote itself to preventive maintenance, not just to repair existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, after all, even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its strategy of maintenance of the city".
There are other places that look neglected and poor, he noted, such as the grease Emblém and El Venadito (monument, statue of deer).
"Today, in order for tourists to come, it is not only a promotion that it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city flowing with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"The necessary attention has not been paid to it here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He spoke of a number of places to put in order in partnership with City Hall, saying the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, the sub-secretary of the Tourist Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, which will need to be put in order first to make these places more attractive and to be able to put them on the list we have for the promotion of this destination."
The IP is requesting results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of decent work and no agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanding a business sector in Mazatlan, as Sinaloa is in convulsions and facing major problems.
As of yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 from PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia party and the last from the PVEM party, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, chairman of the Coordination Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress should take on great responsibility and lead by example on the way to a better Sinaloa in various challenges they face.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to advance their own interests and become carnival processions of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridging that would move the ruling forward in order.
“We want them to do a decent job and be primarily committed to society and sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them confidence in their voice in the past elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all the forces in an effort to achieve the country's economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will encourage the creation of jobs in some way."
When it comes to tourism, he demanded that new lawmakers give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that this is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing about values and investments that, moreover, directly rival agriculture."
In addition, in order to spend funds on start-up tourist projects, Congress should help deliver to the state on security and help with the Alcohol Act, which has failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary terms.
Three Kings are being sought
Dolls, toy cars and bicycles are together with other children's wish lists in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their expectations during the coming feast of the Three Kings, as their household numbers exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor circumstances because the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband's not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes. In the afternoon, I get along with the "plebeians" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for the ten-year-old José Alfred, he would like a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would like to wear clothes in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see his son' because it was very expensive," recalls Cayetan with sadness.
For older children who were just at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isaías size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old Jose Juan lacks sneakers, so he could use a five-and-a-half or six pair.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can participate in the "Found with Three Kings" campaign, and at the reception of the journal Noroeste bring a gift or money in cash.
14 alleged drug traffickers who were arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to make drugs.
"Approximately 750 beds of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hash, money and equipment that were used for production were seized," Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec police, said in a statement.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom alleged the chiefs of the network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to appear at the Palace of Justice in Sherbrook after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, its possession with the aim of trafficking it, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These searches were held subsequently after a long-term investigation that lasted almost a year.
"This was information that we received from the public and that allowed us to approach these arrests," M. said. Ruel.
This police operation involved 70 police officers of the regional department of the investigation of the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, the State Police in Sherbrook and the Sherbrook Memphrémagog Police Administration.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The bill of conservatives, who according to the government should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will clearly be overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I'm leaning on the Charter to a significant extent."
"I stand upright on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, the Liberal leader, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that a bill, as proposed, would allow the detention of up to one year any person coming from a ship, identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of Quebec's Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading towards a bad target.
“We are against it and all opposition parties seem to be against it, so we will see what the government does.” Duceppe.
On the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has dismissed critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be the mains part of another bill, the C-35," Ms Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least a year," Ms. Chow explained.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties.
"Canadians collectively tell MPs that they are not tolerating this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take aim of Canada and treat it like a sycophant."
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, Secretary Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in her bill, which could lead the country to votes leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would ask the vote to answer for every MP who opposes it in front of his constituents.
A new unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement, of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collision, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public commission of inquiry into the issue.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is seeking to ensure that this idea does not fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation from New York in January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec 29. October last year, this measure was not discussed despite the fact that Robert Dutil himself was present.
There was no need for a public safety critic, PQ party member Stéphane Bergeron, to rate the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and an "amateur's solution muddded on his knee."
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future of unity.
"He'll settle for confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of witness interviews in a public hearing.
"Moreover, Mr. Charest confirms that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and I, that he is hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Civil Officials.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposed to Quebec to give special authorization to the Inspector General in order to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, who is allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the writings of the Charest government.
Quebec would also, after Ottawa, change the Criminal Code to be better adapted for this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the commissioner for Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this kind of investigation is not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently looking into some of the amendments associated with this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, even though the Criminal Code was not yet regulated, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under close surveillance.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. it rained from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters was not expected from today until Thursday evening, by regions.
Sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were hit hardest.
A total of up to 100 millimeters could fall there.
If we add up these precipitation with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we may be afraid of floods for some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service declared a warning on Wednesday night about the dangers of floods for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers, in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudière, heavy rainfall caused the flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the outpouring of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The emergency service has an emergency and oversees the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
Quebec's Centers for Flood Predicting issued a warning Wednesday of severe floods for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
The dupont was partially blammed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of Canada's Council on Radio and Television Standards (RRTV) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as because of gross expression during broadcasting.
The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and an inappropriate negative portrayal of Haitians of gross expression that does not correspond to broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Council also concluded that the discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the name of both persons who took their own lives, did not violate the regulations for radio broadcasting.
The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting has received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Joint Front of the recipients of social support to Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts shown in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must submit reliable information, not deceptive.
As for suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most of the members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the broadcast of the "Dupont Midday Reports" have come across a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no complaint against him.
The latest dispute concerned the statements that followed the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort thus engaged in a media shootout that provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he had not sent any donation to help the Haitians because we cannot know with certainty that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of Haitians.
"I've already atoned for my three-day postponement of that thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcaster cooperated "beyond its duties."
For a station which will have to notify, inter alia, these decisions once during the main broadcast within a period of three days, the consequences shall be minimal.
King of gung-fuvà Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originally from Algiers, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange run.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the tatami and rings of the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who now has lived in the capital since 2008 to study with professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches kind of everywhere because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this guy, who works as a security guard and as a helper for UPS, just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30. October, in Edimburg, in Scotland.
"I won the category of full-onking kickboxing and Thai boxing, he stated."
"I'm currently preparing for China for the World Cup in san shou."
"They were invited by opponents who finished first four at the last World Championship in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 in China, I finished in the tournament in the fifth rank, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches of the fist and leg, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and, more rarely, in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal is supposed to keep only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" supertournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a sympathetic fellow."
"It's kind of the equivalent for the Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered a loss in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competing on the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that a single champion, the king of kung fu, can be crowned."
450 contracted millions without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed 450 million by mutual agreement in contracts with companies providing engineering for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is precisely the consortium created from the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, a contract for the management of the entire project in the total amount of 295 million dollars without a public tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility for managing this significant $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of businesses puts in front of us a serious problem of an ethical nature that risks eliminating competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to make a collision and eliminate competition."
“This means that people, no longer make side agreements secretly, now they are doing them openly,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference.
A little earlier, morning, M. Simard asked the National Assembly this question because he says it bears heavily how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected in the afternoon, vigorously denying that it was a collision contract.
"I have my own path," she thundered, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacking accuracy."
She said "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is common practice around the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, that will allow two or more businesses to group their mutual expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the extensiveness of the work.
The construction is already underway and must be laid out by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in engineering consulting is under investigation in government.
If we quickly fly over the business register of Quebec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; namely CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Secretary Normandeau highlighted in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s."
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), has given an explanation that will force us to wrinkle the forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go into a public tender and if there are few participants in the tender that submits the offer, your prices offered may be higher."
"You have two options to choose from: i.e. that you're going to pick up the people who figure in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, "Let's make a satisfying and good-price agreement."
"But the main idea is that the important thing is not the price, but the competence of the people," Mr. Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50 000 received by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification of Le Devoir, he counted 109 contracts for consulting in the field of engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, especially with laboratories performing soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin scored 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in "Energie gérance."
All contracts have been concluded.
Together, they amount to $449 783 344, including a contract with Énergie gérance at $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four firms that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very good known Liberal Party of Quebec."
Secretary Normandeau has released a report that PQ is also linked to companies that "fund" it, before specifying that it was more of its executives.
The barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer trusts very little to the actors of sustainable development, but also to "impartial" brands and environmental certificates, to follow the choice of products accordingly.
The worst part is that even when we bathe in a media universe that urges us and encourages socially more responsible consumption, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, a non-compliance with obligations that even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, according to Baromètre’s responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them still do not believe them much
Two-thirds of us actually say that we don’t believe the promises of environmental companies, simply because the company’s green advertising is a measuring tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates, attached to so-called fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that are referred to as environmentally responsible, according to Barometre.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this subject is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be the primary priority for stimulating this consumption page, currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and questionable nature of information would temper the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of the people in Quebec are incredulously opposed to the information about the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010 almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A full 61% of them favored shopping at merchants from their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, according to Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québek likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which strives for the least possible impact on the environment by taking care of the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience obviously remained somewhere outside their car, according to Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they were using public transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in the interest of protecting nature.
Walking and cycling also supported 39.1% of participants in this large-scale survey of behavior who used this cliché.
State loan to buy eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have applied for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees with the co-payment, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The Developper company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurenta and which demonstrated its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the government proposes a loan to Quebec, the amount of which would be lower, some was the original expectation, which could build the basis for a viable solution on favorable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to a reduction.
The proposal and plan of activities was sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the cinematographic project eXcentris.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, the state's donation hypothesis seems to have to be really rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinema Centers in Quebec opposed the direct investment of the state in order to encourage the purchase of eXcentris, reckoning that the Minister of Culture should not finance the real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
But a few participants in the discussion, on the other hand, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, was given cinemas within ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been the reason for the amendment by the State Financial Council.
The lack of halls for independent films is garish in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to win a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to release funds into the private sector, in the belief that it will spend $700 000 to push through the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on 27. February next year and screen the most beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and so he ignores himself, so he and his group think of the proposals for diminishment that are made to him.
The raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic U.S. sources known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of inferiority of Canadians towards Americans, but by the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority of the latter against Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter is concerned about Canadian-American relations when they go to the polls, and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, between which were the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday, lined to the public, provide sensitive details to get each other "under the skin."
The September 22, 2008 communication, i.e. in the middle of an election campaign, details what point the United States is not part of the stakes that political leaders are discussing.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost fixed, conditions perhaps political leaders to talk about internal bets, rather than realizing that these elections also affect the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
“The United States is, therefore,” he concluded, “by the proverbial elephant in this election: the pervasive, but potentially too threatening, to be talked about.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better to lead a party chief of these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your path will help ensure the maintenance of the government in a vote of confidence in early February, relating to the federal budget, by which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than a decade, because of a recovery plan of 30 to 40 billion dollars," M. M. Breese.
There is no mention of the government having to adjourn the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that opposition parties are conditional on their survival by the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, highlights an increasingly negative picture of the United States being cast by dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not very savvy references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purposes of violent interrogations with the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that in their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some of the Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of "case by case."
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to a state secretary."
"The secretary accepted that she would revise the file."
Let's finally note that the people involved in WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the waves of the CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed."
It spread out, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Light Renewal Plan
The UN yesterday proposed a plan in Cancún to restore home lighting, lighting shops and industrial spaces in 100 countries in order to achieve a greenhouse effect restriction (GES) equivalent to almost one-third of the additional restrictions that need to be achieved to stabilize the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of large concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancun to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-reach commitments to reduce on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if hot bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market, replace the bulbs with flucompact or, even better, bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet created due to lighting would be degraded.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
It's the equivalent of 70% of emissions from an auto park across the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to fall from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct 5 more Gt from this balance to achieve by 2020 the stabilisation of climate heating to 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude that it will not get out of control.
In hot bulbs 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5% is the product of light.
With flucompact bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new bulbs with DEL, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Flucompact bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, which he put into production this week in Philips - this company reportedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a hot bulb, giving us an idea of a possible saving with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about flucompact light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be sorted as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collections.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a flucompact light bulb, but rather a thermal coal-fired power plant, which emits the many mercury needed to generate electricity wasted in hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put 25 000 tons of mercury per year into circulation.
The report also details the profits that any country would make from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of a 3.5 thermal power plant, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for an independent election commission to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results, a spokesperson for the UN president stressed."
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the latest date - Wednesday midnight - pass, without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's scrum.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission was "continuing to work" so that it could announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara, have multiplied worldwide.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on annulment by the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" voting in the north, which has been administered by former New Army (FN) rebels since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the voter intimidation maneuvers, practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country, have discouraged supporters of the president of Ivory Coast from going to the polls.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
But opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who is dementing any connection with the former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the release of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the electoral commission from broadcasting the results would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections, taking place on Sunday, was seen as a coronation of the country's reunification and reconciliation process, which has been split in two for years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday that it could be held accountable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, 31. October, as a winner with 38% of the vote versus 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained steadily at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional data with seasonal deviation correction (CVS) published by the INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed people held steady at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 points.
In a broader scope, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, regardless of whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of current young people in the labour market has escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24,2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25%, including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637 000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were out of work.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), i.e. 482 000 people from 50 years of age higher and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the 25-49-year-old population has seen the benefit from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% across France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy about its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, is continuing to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday reported a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October after being 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put into custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and the brother of the PS Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was charged and incarcerated in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly subtruly obtained.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of misuse of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, the provision of bribes, the receipt of bribes in order to influence the office and possess ammunition, according to his attorney.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and insists that he and the judge explain all the questions this one intends to ask him, and not some mirages."
“It’s easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP.
Mr Guérini said through his attorneys that he had sent a brief message to the judge before his questioning to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
When it comes to awarding contracts or destinations of funds linked to their operation, he never knew of anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In the matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was charged Wednesday with misuse of public funds and plots, and left at large, under court supervision with a ban on seeing, the protagonists of the matter.
"My client was able to explain all the facts he was accused of."
"The investigating judge is taking this into account and leaves him at large," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said in a statement.
Another four people were charged and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with being under court oversight over two of them, Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes for the purpose of influencing the office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "theft and misuse of society's property," the other for "complot in the misuse of public funds."
Finally, the business associate of Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been charged with "concealing the misuse of the company's property."
Among those confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case involving fraudulent public contracts involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of helping to wash money from widespread gangsterism.
The investigation is conducted in the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the conclusion of public contracts, in particular in the matter of waste.
From the source of a close investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the city community of Marseille (MPM).
Coltilde Reiss case: Elysée palace exaggerates Syria's mediation
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran over "espionage," unified views in France, put diplomacy on a combat alert and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents, received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the drawbacks of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained his strategy to the Americans, and he went so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group of cruisers).
They show how leading French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the U.S. justice for subtly trafficking in material in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting the sharp light to the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
He didn't actually do anything for it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: "Iran: French comments on the way of solution in the event of hostages".
An adviser from the Elysée Palace on Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa's Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with U.S. Foreign Minister Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do just as much to get them back to their homeland of their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "consistently strongly pronounce "in the media the words "the basic rights of a person," "innocence," "immediate deliverance."
It is necessary to bring into trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop it."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "they will not solve anything," the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier recalls that the arrests of foreigners are "an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of "political blackmail."
It announces that the acquittal of Klotilda Reiss (which occurs on 16 August, the day the French embassy gives her refuge) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (a deposit of 230 000 euros).
And he announces that the Elysee Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will escalate."
The Iranians could "arrest another roughly 1800 French people living in Iran in the future," according to the statement.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago but still remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States declares to have been deported for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing match.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to acquire material destined for a nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France agree to bargaining?
The liberation of the Iranian for the liberation of a young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, as it states, was not only "surprised by this judge's decision" but sought a way to oppose it.
"There have been talks between the presidency and the justice minister" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of French intelligence.
An adviser to the Elysee Palace dials a phone number, hangs a telephone phone and then informs an American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Parisian buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotilda Reiss's detention in Iran, the Elysée Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqué and organized "leaks" to the media, to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing the "significant" and "influential" role of "mediator."
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and state that manipulation bears fruit, because several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "freshness" of French officials."
What is the basis for such a degree of "gratitude", expressed against M. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication "aims at validating President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," analyzes.
The policy applied in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in both France and abroad and labeled premature and undeserved."
By "how he exaggerates the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "demonstrate Syria what kind of chants it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the area."
The goal is also to "sown a grain of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is"
"But we thanked them."
"This should at least bring confusion and confusion among the Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysee Palace.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the liberation of our countrywoman."
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival" that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December so that it can ask companies operating online games to block access to these games after midnight to persons under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
“We believe that this bill is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a senior official in the ministry in charge of the bill.
Online games will be newly accessible from 6 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also anticipates asking companies to limit their daily access time to these young people's games, whose parents request it, the responsible worker added.
It will also make free programs available to people who request it, to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "affected" and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an indisputable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full of unrest on suspicion of corruption is being established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday of the World Cup host countries in 2018 and 2022, a selection supremely politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risks overtaking technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal Fifa competition in 2018 will be held in Europe , a traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to plant in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities to participate in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, senior government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk of lasting until the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the Fifa documentation assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But those reasons won't have much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour intended for the vote.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation leading to the suspension of two members of the CE (European Commission?) for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have thus destroyed the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has so far hosted the world championship only once, in a year.
The BBC put the crown on it on Monday when it aired a documentary that "bugged on a pin" by three influential CE (European Commission?) members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and bring English leaders into trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor Tony Blair, who managed to win the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new brilliance to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair of Spain-Portugal do not lack the trump cards of the already prepared stadiums, its adventures (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin has decided not to move the championship to Curich and publicly declare "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in verbal allusions only barely twisted on the English press's accusations against CE (European Commission) members.
"We'll throw mud at them, we'll try to compromise them," said Mr. Poutin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its considerable experience of 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of Fifa, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have drawn up a beautiful project.
But those candidacies seem premature for the two countries, which together underwent a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa favors feverishly, has made the Asian chances invalid for 2022.
With Qatar pulling a large ace from its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could pay for the flimsy TV fees (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for Fifa.
Second mandate: clarity (security)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand gave the impression that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysee Palace is calling someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of the secret associated with the presidency.
It is necessary to act as if doubts persist constantly.
In one sense and the other.
In 2006, without any confidence, Jacques Chirac's friends made demands that a third mandate not be ruled out.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would "decide sometime in the autumn of 2011."
As the UMP recalls in front of members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday night at the Elysee Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has sown a little feverish state.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The president merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notice.
This is not the first time he is commemorating such meetings in a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, it's because of the two truths.
Speeding up the path to running for the PS, on the one hand.
But that's not the entrance to Ségolène Royal's field, pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
This is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in PS want to make the arrangement into combat line-ups rather premature than intended.
Poor reconnaissance on the other hand.
First, the voters of the right would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we don't discuss the UMP issue," the people from the immediate vicinity of the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with clarity.
Euro: The central European bank forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council Central in the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for taking out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of the sovereign European claim commits, the institute for issuing securities will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of a deterioration of the situation today already so tense in the European securities markets.
The political price would be even higher in that case.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in favour of resolving the debt relief of European states.
She didn't want to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing their top bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...) ".
The evening before, in Brussels, during his questioning by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissions, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not turn out to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and satisfied that he stated that the programme of purchasing state titles in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting that takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: The central European bank will keep its base unchanged interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds from the coffers made by the Central European Bank have doubled to nearly 1.35 billion euros in the last week.
And thanks to the unreasonableness of the dealers on the market, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the eurosystem's central banks have bought 67 billion euros since May 2010.
No doubts are admitted between the anticipations market-market agreements on the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change of course.
If the operations of the loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter bank shall proceed to provide liquid funds in an unlimited manner and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine her changing her agenda in a significant way."
“If it didn’t, it would mean accepting the risk of triggering a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds to the plan for its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds to revive the dull market."
In view of the exposures of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“It needs to replace the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the flare-up of paid performance by the states, which are among the most fragile,” the big bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates take off, states will be all the more troubled to reduce their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It's a bailout of the euro at that price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government is hunching his back
After the start of the week, the situation eased a little for Italy, yesterday with a reverse flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the economy minister, the region's presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "unresolvable" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then dismissed involved.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points, and the price of anti-bankruptcy (CDS) contracts skyrocketed to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the deviation with German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, declared himself "too busy" with "the tumultuous development of the markets" and a possible outbreak originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that he's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and lack of fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state to the risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
Brussels' latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is expected to rise to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against the 3.9% projected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From here, a rumor of a new summary of supplements to the state budget proposal, which could be introduced after the holidays, of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be taken," evaluates the economic affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy accepts the support of international institutions.
"The cornerstones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Directors under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, not even short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product of 2011, the NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the efforts required by other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that, elections could be held, which are expected to take place at the end of March.
This would start a period, not suitable for taking a decision in a case of serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "I think the Europeans demonstrated this on Sundays throughout the day and night, they are clearly very solidarity determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday's recorded expansion on interest on European government bonds brought water to the mill to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalcy yet.
The Standard & Poor's Notation Office announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, the target that is most focused on by various speculations.
"Because in May there is a lack of transparency and obvious policy, mainly based on banking systems," economists at Exane BNP Paribas said.
All the more so because "political time is running slower than market time."
Aware of this broken context and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most affected issue, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
This is with regard to the Eurogroupe and Ecofin groupings from the beginning of next week.
The Central European Bank meeting is taking place today.
The agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, has made a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday, with the aim of informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If this is not the goal of increasing the funds, it certainly prepares the ground to achieve this goal.
The first issuance of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilized funds by additional direct engagement in FMI.
The countries involved, first and foremost, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to labour market organisation.
Reforms that attach to strict measures with quick effect.
Lisbon and Madrid a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international aid before applying their own budgetary correctives and deciding on structural reforms necessary to regain their continued confidence.
The capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options, available for speeding up the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stockpile again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, which is the actor of the very first plan of trade in European sovereign claims, believe that the addition of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exist: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized by 60 billion euros to this day.
A council that has all the chances to be tried in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snow rations still cause difficulties in transport, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties have an orange emergency from now on because of the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres a la Vienne forest, has joined 20 districts that already have a declared orange emergency, 18 as early as Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant torrents of snow are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and the Charentes forest and snowing slightly on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, sometimes up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions are affected.
The torrents of snow are big enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy freight transport - trucks over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police officers, and the police recommend driving their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for that day.
In Picardia, school connections were banned for Thursday.
No special measures are expected on Wednesday evening to restrict freight traffic.
The district authority "calls all car drivers to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt the driving nature of the road."
The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy Airport on Thursday and 10% to Orly because of expected snow torrents.
The DGAC recommends passengers using air transport services to contact their company.
In the UK, until Thursday morning, Gatwick airports in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Billions have been raining since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of the 23 billion on the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the state announced the granting of a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
In theory, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for the contracts.
Today we finally get to the First Amendments.
The 2010 Rectification Act, which examines the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the office tax on Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The yield on this interest is 117 million euros a year".
The second is the renovation of the rate for offices, which already exists "to be modernised, to increase the yield obtained from it and to affect this increase to Société du Grand Paris."
How much would it bring?
A mirage.
This is not quantified in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources join the 4 billion euros from the capital subsidy, which will be mobilized by the state and put into the company Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We at SGP do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we created the revenue (both taxes, ndr), we can cover the studies for three years and then rake in 4 billion, it's explained here."
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as needed."
SGP considers that 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 promised billions belong to still absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Vindictive hackers and industrious spy
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of hypocrisy, which governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks volumes about profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a future controlled by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists entirely of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of the Americans' way of sex life by Berlusconi is announcing what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's infamous cartoon profile has long been a subject for cabaret artists to make sketches.
The rule that secret documents can only consist of messages already known is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (he does not even know where to look for reports of non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could, I know, be the editor in the newspaper Libération) who considers only what he himself admits to be true.
The high-secrecy information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. Embassy sent to the state resort, was the same that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why has so much fuss about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War and since the time when the heads of state can make phone calls or fly by plane for a joint dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching movies about the investigation knows very well that only out of hypocrisy seems to ignore it.
However, the fact that this is repeated in public defames the duty of hypocrisy and sheds a bad light on U.S. diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most severely classified information of the world's most powerful country represents a hard hit, not a not insignificant, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and its "executors."
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in the time of Orwell, all power could be conceived, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been proven since, thanks to the ability to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, the citizen became the absolute victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it goes now, that even "tombs" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as the avenger of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can you retain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that true mystery is an inconsequential secret (and a fearless secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious, contentious secret because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secret was a content-free secret to him.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound of the power invited so significant?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would amount to its publication on a poster mounted on a street corner.
But it's also perfectly obvious that with current technology, it's pointless to hope that it can be kept secret by the phone message.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of her colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know that for now my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials transporting themselves discreetly filling formalities along uncontrollable routes and carrying with them only those messages they know by heart or rather hiding rare information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be preserved in unique copies in the key-locked sockets: in total, the attempt to espionage in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated wire-based telegraphs (phone).
Videotapes (analogs) allowed cinema lovers to take the movie step by step, move it forward and backward, and reveal all the secrets of the assembly,while now CDs (digits) allow only to jump chapters, that is, after macro portions.
Through high-speed trains, we will reach Milan from Rome in three hours, while on a trip by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
It is not extraordinary, therefore, that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn wagons.
The last note.
Other times, the press tried to understand what was plotted in the secret of the embassy.
Now it's the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
The clima: how France hacked its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test the observance of promises for rapidly unblocked funding (top by fast start-up funding) or early ones, implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks were uncovered
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30bn in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (that is, 420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU pulled out a large ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to financing a fast start: a report specifying the action of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, bringing it on the right track to keep its pledge of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we'll find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is carried out without prejudice to Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some member states, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years of the fast start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public assistance for development.
France, by contrast, believes that the funding of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous periods or to the global level of public assistance for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France's support towards developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), it is intended to comply with its commitment to the financing of "new and additional "...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule there yet, and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ borrowed equal to 1€ donated.
Clearly, it's hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be supported for some investments that are profitable (often those associated with reducing emissions, consisting in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro, which we get, as the equivalent of one euro we give... , we should not understand it on the basis of our obligations, but as the price of the loan for the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France can only give such a justification: it "adheres" to its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document so you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses a loan on such a scale.
Germany has claimed 46% from there, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% of the donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union gives 1€ to make a promise of satisfaction, France will give only 10 centims and consider this effort to be comparable.
Beautiful juggler's piece!
To sum up, in its financing of the "fast start" France operates with a double trick-or-treat: on the one hand, with the development of the stock over time and, on the other, with a real financial burden.
Although he spends just 36.1 million euros, he can convince himself that he is issuing 420 million euros of "new and additional" in connection with his promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when they just need to borrow?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The early funding chapter is just a small question, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this won't be our case.
Whatever this is, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounting records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and decency and justice towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing deposits into long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not miss the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France should change its position to become as progressive about these deposits as others.
Everyone is therefore putting their hopes in the new Minister for the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will be coming to Cancun next week.
The surprise announcement of France's fast-start launch and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in discussions.
An alarm about the pesticides that children eat.
A ten-year-old will eat 81 different chemicals one day, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "do not have a significant statistical value with regard to the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the processed issue", bought foods commonly consumed in four meals between July and September and one light meal as a light snack per child roughly ten years in supermarkets in l'Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are carcinogenic, possible or likely, and five substances are clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internal excretion (PE) glands, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical accepted individually are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in exposure to consumers to contaminants, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten résidues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, cited by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including in France banned by a fungicidal agent.
The same is true for the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, for which studies have discovered traces of severe insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, steak of minced meat, tuna in a can and even a bun and chewing gum were splashed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
The salmon steak for dinner was "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this "cocktail of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," according to the study.
The Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) has proposed "in the face of an urgent situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilisational diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereal.
