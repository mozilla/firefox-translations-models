Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policy with the necessity of combating voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center calls such a fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of U.S. election fraud in the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states have responsibility for organizing federal elections in the U.S.
And in that spirit, most U.S. governments have been proclaiming new laws since 2009 that make the process of election or entry into the electoral list difficult.
The phenomenon saw a boom after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to submit photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, invalidate the right to register on the list of voters on the day of the election and withdraw the right to vote for citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required a photo ID on voters.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitutionality of the Indiana Act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to expand this procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported drafting such laws in 34 states to force voters to present photo identity cards.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity cards, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens do not own, i.e. 21 million people of the age allowing to vote, no photo ID issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, it does not have such an identity card of about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are particularly disproportionately affected mainly by young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
Therefore, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes below 35 000 dollars; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their inclination to Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote rather Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for the election.
The first such request was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve states have passed laws that stipulate the duty of voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
Republican legislators in 2011 backed laws in eight states that repeal the registration of voters on the day of the election.
Moreover, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.
These limitations have consequences.
During the 2004 general election, for example, campaigns for the registration of voters helped to register about 10 million inhabitants.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a decrease of 17% in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in the other five states to shorten the period for in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans accounted for 33% of voters who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
The same was true of Hispanics.
They accounted for just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, made up just 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed the approval of the laws that limit voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the validity of the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General even intervened.
In part, they managed to reduce the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 countries have taken laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will make the exercise of the right to vote quite undeniably more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the bias of the passed laws and see it as an obvious effort to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states where those laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral corps necessary to win the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test sometimes produced incorrect results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, resulting in unnecessary medical treatments.
All this increased the hesitancy of the men, who were already so reluctant to go for the examination.
Get examined or not?
We have asked two experts for an opinion.
In studies conducted in the U.S., a high level of contamination between the individual groups tested was demonstrated, making it difficult to interpret these results and bring valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, reported a different mortality rate between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not go for it.
This study also showed after a 12-year gap that those who do not go for the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from 50 years of age or from 40 years of age if your direct relative has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also a more vulnerable group.
The key is to take the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and species that are indifferent.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are untreated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
We will suggest them to exercise active supervision and, in case of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly and with greater accuracy, we set criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not to treat.
I recommend taking the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows you to evaluate for and against in connection with the PSA examination.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the best means for reducing the risks of disease seems to be the acceptance of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and moved enough, up to 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, that figure would rise to at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
In contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers cause heredity.
A percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the anti-smoking fight remains a priority, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
According to the SCC, bodies and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
With too much consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet yielded unambiguous conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although, according to one, the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study talks more about increasing it.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his fears and precedents from his family with his doctor.
"Getting undergoing an examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson sparked a legitimate stir last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And it is also the last particle, the existence of which is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no certainty among physicists that it is a Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal, which very much resembles the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the Great Congress of Physics in Kyoto rather confirm it, but all the data is still missing so that we can be absolutely certain.
However, suppose it's a Higgs boson, because the risks of error appear to be small, and let's look at what it's all about.
In this world, there is a completely unquestionable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's excretory principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides physicists into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to Pauli's principle.
And there are bosons at the other end, the wicked anarchists who value nothing at all - certainly not of this principle, which means that they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way, absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: mesons, which we leave unnoticed here, and "power particles" that spread great natural forces and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as could be thought.
If you read this article, it is thanks to the boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "light particle" that is the "bearer" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, similar to the pebble thrown into the pond.
This "disturbance" will give rise to an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "force carriers."
A more stable field
It's also with the Higgs boson, except that it's necessary to "disturb" a different field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen level of the pond, only a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge accelerator part as the accelerator in the laboratory of CERN - a large hadron accelerator with accommodating beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be held by itself on the fridge.
And anyway, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let’s look at it) don’t have it.
And Mrs. Nováková asks, what is the purpose of all this research, what "they will bring us"?
From the point of view of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any mismatch between observations and SM predictions.
Moreover, few physicists literally want to be found, because the slightest difference could open up space for "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to state that the model has still huge flaws, brings no clarification of gravity (oha!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the cosmic matter (again!).
However, the CERN facility has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Respondencies
The responses of these researches in the daily lives of Mr and Mrs Novák are very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Look: at the very beginning of the 60's, the pioneers of the laser in Bell's labs had no idea of the revolution that their work would provoke.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said this - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab."
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that you really never know...
Palliative Care – The Best Way to Leave Life... | Le Devoir
Through his Commission on Dignified Dying, Quebec has recently become involved in a delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate should continue shortly and a bill is about to be drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years to live and it's already seven," he says emotionlessly on his bed at the vilative care house of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: immense weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the toilet himself or to eat alone.
He looks at a tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer a bath.
Courage for ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In all your life, you learn that men urinate standing up," Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility, recounts.
Going back to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person" whether he accepts the return, says the psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of people engaged in palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with victor-Gadbois palliative care all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "curative" care.
In the case of Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "on suffocation in full consciousness."
The disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life anymore," she says, and then she allows us to put on her breathing apparatus.
Still, he is still looking forward to his last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois's home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one bed of palliative care per 11 700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die someday.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, it can be provided, for example, with a sip of brandy or pepsi, to taste.
Diabetics no longer have to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night they carried a beer to Mr. X, who later died last night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of the late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones," Nathalie Savard, the director of the nursing service, recounts.
In Victor-Gadbois's home, the days go one after another, but they don't resemble each other.
Alongside a ninety-three-year-old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family thoroughly padded on his pillows while toasting in his honor, a tragically thirty-six-year-old man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children dies after trying out all the options to survive.
"For half a year, there are always three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer up to 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their homes, and 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care that is intended to relieve suffering once the sick arrive at the final stage of their lives, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montréal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is precisely this fundamental unavailability of healthcare in Quebec that leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been signed in circulation by peaks in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure all people’s access to quality palliative care before it can be agreed to carry out euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in huge pains without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is worried that patients will not ask for death because they are not getting appropriate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were minimal when she abandoned demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncoler that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was no longer fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative pussy relieved their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society for Home Palliative Care of the Grand Montréal area, patients are resisting pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether impactful or whether the sedatives are given permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient we can't get rid of pain will have an increasing opportunity to access palliative sedatives.
The sick, who are not given a sedative, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't always necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means more "I want you to relieve me of pain."
The implementation of this report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in Health Care.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, entrepreneurs in construction and public works, political party lobbyists and experts on the Italian mafia still tell what they know about the amazing "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters mix.
This "field" came very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took fundamental measures," Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec's MP and former chief of police in Montreal, says ironically.
Thanks to him, a scandal broke out in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous investigation aimed at embezzling funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which were approved by then-liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest only after long delays.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party funding and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the start of the 2010 investigation," he says, "only the Department of Transportation has saved a billion dollars on contracts," when some people kept their instincts to gain a share of them!
The Charbonneau commission has "already led two mayors to resign," adding with the hope that it will manage to "unravel the cunning of some people."
A permanent unit for the fight against corruption established in 2011
A permanent unit for the fight against corruption established in 2011 is also engaged in combat with its military of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of the "Marteau family", who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "cartel of money pipelines" significantly mitigate the inflating of orders...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a number of searches and have charged a number of municipal councillors with fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a municipality from the suburbs.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public procurement.
The formal accusations have already been received by Montreal transport engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito sparked a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of obtaining public procurement.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the values of the contracts he had won in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
After 2000, Zambito was generous on all sides and donated more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (around 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegally raising funds for former liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines, whose prices he exaggerated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very vigorously.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it in great detail before the committee: within ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for contracts with money-lines, for which he exaggerated the price.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had paid their rewards for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through false extra work.
The mayor's party's organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye to the parallel budget that was bringing dirty money into his coffers.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay stepped down in early November, plunging Montréal into a sweeping crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning sign.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, she has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for US$5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters right in the middle of a flourishing real estate business.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says he is "pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the system of infested ants to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these questionable practices cannot be returned.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars" but fears in particular the role of "MPs informed of this cunning" if they have not dipped into these messes!
He estimates that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony adds: "I've heard that it's just a weak decoction of reality."
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to parties to 100 dollars, but that doesn't solve the situation: "Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money from politics will not go away."
It proposes comprehensive scrutiny of the public procurement and party funding system: "Which we can no longer fall; if we focus boldly on the substance of things, we can build again on stronger foundations and with greater scrutiny and compliance with the laws."
If this story has smeared the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends to all those who mock him to look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or a completely new dimension of PSG.
The big players came to us.
I get next to them every day.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier in matches.
Everything is going really fast in football.
I don't lose my head.
From my start in the preparation in INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I always moved up the individual stages.
So you're using the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The back-ups from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training session is essential.
And it follows that a player like me has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
And on top of that, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has tremendous experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring conversation with him in January.
I had a number of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you view the first part of the PSG season?
In League 1, Lyon took our leading position.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have very easily advanced to the eight-finals.
What is your goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first before Porto so we can play in a rematch of the eight-final at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
For Paris to become a big European club, it must win titles and make history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this intention happen.
And would it be a big setback not to win League 1 like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the power to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will happen this year.
Although the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also aiming for the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us given what's been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something they're blaming us for in the newspaper, it's not exactly pleasant.
You ask what else people might want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4:0 on every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who have not made it to the eight-finals for the second season, and have also invested large sums!
Given the sums invested, you could be expected to have 15 points ahead of the others!
This offends other clubs and the French league.
The Lyon and Marseille clubs, who have not fared well last season, have moved into the next phase with the new PSG.
That shows how amazing League 1 is.
I hope we can smile in May and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems as if PSG in everything relied on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances.
It's good that it's said that there is "dependence on Zlatan."
That means Ibrahimovic is very powerful and that he scores a lot of goals.
Because of that, he came here and proves to be the star of League 1.
Wherever he passed, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
We respect both the person and the player in our team.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I couldn't play the way I would have imagined.
But I've experienced it and I've come out of it stronger.
Today I manage to play good matches in the team.
And I have been hoping for this since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our demeanors exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the World Championships.
The coach picks strictly, is close to the players and can thrill for victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead our team to Brazil.
There's a draw (1:1) of 16. October in Spain a solid starting match?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current central bank-based financial transactions, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies is leading to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...) and a secure conversion protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15 000 computers connected to the network, about 200 000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The exchange rate of bitcoin first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to 2 dollars, today it is at the limit of about ten dollars (the exchange rate overview is shown on the page bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which came out in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money," "competing dollar and euro" and "the equivalent of ordinary money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like "credits" used to advance in a video game that a person gains by playing or that can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are depositaries of the book of current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in fact between two electronic addresses using email.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by the dual key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Furthermore, thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public current account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is proceeded by solving the mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the process of cutting a file; i.e., transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then "cut" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its correctness.
The transaction is then indestructibly displayed connected to the string of all other transactions; any modification would change the imprint.
If the user would like to pay twice with the same money in a row (within ten minutes) for the purpose of fraud, the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different fingerprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided into a hundred million, so the margin space is here...
The difficulty of the task is also increasing with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The used log does not apply to the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-time payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls money laundering options thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins do not orbit.
"Huge discounts" were launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, is dedicated to converting bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make it cheaper.
In addition, the carrier manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, Pierre Noizat specifies, assuring that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement in questioning hierarchical systems and moving to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin asserts itself, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB foresees a re-evaluation of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this kind of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapsa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The biggest harm suffered was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside, who we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so we, for we have lost 88 of the soldiers killed, and all those wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the peaks of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without assaulting helicopters with airborne escorts.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
The Kabul was empty at the time and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of the struggles between the various resistance groups.
Their takeover of control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurity of these peasants, which was completely dominated by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation did not improve until our time.
The former mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in subordinate standing.
Major dignitaries from the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land, which they sold as building plots to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people long for a government that won't be made up of thieves.
A number of young people want to leave as those who have managed to exploit American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and associated ideologies.
During the exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world and were intrigued by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full, both girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they no longer want to return to the obscurity of the former parties or the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes cell phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world, watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take the lead be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be out of the control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralization following the example of Western states, but the U.S. wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which has existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 50's and earlier years.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is working, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war, government infrastructure control would be necessary.
There were rumours that Afghanistan possessed enormous mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that Western states were here just to seize it.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the site and without means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, however, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine and left international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist compound to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, the Department of French at universities, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative to "get a heart and soul" was in place attempting to reconcile aid and military activities, which served as a service of "civic-army steps" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a small French NGO.
These works, in which a number of local workers were involved, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the culvable area.
What memory will we leave after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often located at an altitude above 2 000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for minor agricultural assistance from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the uprisings led by foreign groups, they wish to obtain a slight civic assistance for their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Difficult work on the Egyptian constitution
President Mohammed Morsi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants him unlimited powers, he decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else's opinion, that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave this assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," continues to "violate his word" and "tramples on the law."
But his supporters assure that this is a means of dealing with the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum is expected to take place in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is buffeted by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the U.S. weekly Time, Muhammad Morsi seems confident that Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially since this hurriedly organized vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I keep unlimited powers" that should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 deputies of the aforementioned constituent assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was proclaimed, they slammed the door, saying they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities have mimicked their move.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 alternates were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further paused that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... hours for prayer when some members of the committee were of the opinion that the clock in the meeting room was not properly adjusted.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and provides that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental demands, hoped to replace the term "principle" with the term "rules," which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," argue liberals, who see only a rhetorical issue in it.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular on issues of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the persons called for comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The beginnings of theocracy can be seen in this.”
The concerns of the Liberals are further fueled by the fact that the university's next rector should be less moderate than the existing one.
"For now, there has been no particular religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state in the framework.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of them graduated in French schools," moderates the concerns of Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions regarding the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
There is especially a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to comment on it."
Yesterday's approved text is highly criticized in addition to religious pages because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction against the former regime.
Another disputed place: the powers conferred on the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Council of Defence.
Furthermore, proceedings against civilians will not be banned in military courts, as required by the human rights association.
These associations speak of their doubts in connection with the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While Egypt's president was scheduled to speak in a televised address last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the navel of the world and the sea from a saturated salt solution are waiting for Ukrainian tourists
The promised land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the intactness of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bowing to the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God's mercy will descend on all who enter this "spa".
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: the transformation of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to His disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will walk the Path of Pain, or the Way of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passing through the streets of the Old Town and leading to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews - the Wall of Lamentations, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make the journey through the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruin is located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with mountaineering can access it on their own.
The others will be taken to this historic mountain by cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods reportedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit everyone in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, which were found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel-Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
The Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented in its exhibition.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which represents several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly rejected.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You step inside - and you find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished are the names of the Jewish children.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
The three main spa resorts of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea you can bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
By the way, the dead sea is the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest mainland point of the planet - at the level of 417 m below sea level.
Côte d'Azur water in it is a saturated saline solution that is easy to keep at the surface even for people who can't swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and medicinal mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to cure your ruffled nerves.
Touch the mysterious past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
A glorious naval route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, tourists love wandering through narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the aisle of your "sign", luck will favor you favorably.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get a picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is approximately 3.8 shekel).
The city's transport is mainly buses, but there is a speed tram in Jerusalem, and in the city of Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Traveling through all modes of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, which you can drive for 1.5 hours with the transfer.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, work ceases in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get kosher meals: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes, in which a combination of milk and meat is included.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, all kinds of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are very many fattened cats that "roam according to their taste".
In the evening you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The leading cats love the crowded places and will eagerly embark on every goodness.
According to the car brand, car rental will cost from 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - 15 dollars a day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to get to know the country and rest.
The country was visited by the promised from January to October 2012 to 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of visas 9. February 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants save money for language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the mandatory language exams bill, fraudsters have already emerged in the country selling "forged" certificates
13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law came into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass an examination of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that in time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundation of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to the people who successfully managed to achieve attestation and obtain an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin's Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, State University of St. St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass exams in all cities; already today, more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have been able to ask the press many times: and what will it really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
Thus, first of all - the representatives of the migration service correspond - this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labour."
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in occupational-free emigrants, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to clashes with rogue people who, under the pretext of help, will ensure a "vouch" for terrible, tight hostels in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland, they promise one thing, but after their arrival they cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay their promised wages," confirms the head of the Main Tajik Labour Migration Administration, MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear!
All the less so because many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get into, but do not even have experience with the work in question.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, but rather misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed children something, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, put on and equipped for school.
As children grow up to working age, they must go for work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, in the light of the Linguistic Testing Act, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who have a legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't take exams or get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live illegally as they used to live in Russia.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and this results in cases of extortion.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Hushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared his experience with reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy some painting"
On the first day of the law on language, it was found that not only the documents of migrants on registration were false.
FMS employees have already seized several false certificates of passing the language exam.
Counterfeit documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope that it would facilitate the problem of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times the amount than passing the official test: it will cost migrating workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to ensure the system against corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy the documents, in which the government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed tests the first time, the necessary time to take a course in the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take the illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of offences using legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of the Interior of Russia presents a proposal to tighten the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the stimulus was the cases of shootings at weddings that were without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow attorney Dimitry Vinogradov, who resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age from which a gun licence can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea is supported by the head of the Committee on Security and the Fight against Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who has promised that changes to the Arms Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist, in an interview with the Russian BBC editorial board.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, in the six months of 2012 there were committed 142 crimes from the use of firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while over the same period a total of 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, tightening civil gun legislation will not prompt the perpetrators to switch to a "black" market.
According to them, it is currently possible to find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Interior Ministry says the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "Black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baranec, who worked for ten years in the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept gun orders
The first - an "army or military route," that is, a weapon that was stolen during fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranec.
Another type of "black guns" are guns stolen by criminals from security forces officials.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal "mainly" goes on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
"It is proven that some of the fires were started intentionally - to cover up the manka," the former soldier says.
According to Barance, the gun manufacturers also make their contribution.
"At present, private arms companies that are not competitive in the international market are being created and are decommissioning weapons that supply the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes the weapons are produced in small-scale production, and a mafia was created that organized their continuous production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up what is the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons have found themselves on the black market "due to officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was a theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the gun shops, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" are no longer being bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the Ensign, the buyer buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
You order a gun with him, and he sells it over the fence.
"He's going to take her to town and sell it for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever their plan in the clarification of crimes starts to burn, they carry out a control purchase with illegal arms dealers," the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to switch to the "Test" platform, where there will be a man who would lead me to a "dot" where we will negotiate with each other.
I learned the price only there
Military correspondent Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a weapon, I need a friend who knows the way out, tells the salesman - the counselor.- I have such a friend, but I do not fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to tell the daughter the tooth had fallen out."
And now I'm going to get there through the person I'm sure of.
He will only supply them to me because he knows that I will not give him up.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was processing an article for publication on the topic.
The schemes have not changed, according to him.
They gave him an album with photos where "all you thought of it."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalled.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněc, does not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller to the forest and build a target for that.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Container on the sofa
Search engines will bring you to websites and groups on the Internet on "Contact", where you can buy a gun "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a specified amount of money," they write in the ad headline on the website "Buy a fighting gun or a vending machine."
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course, without a license," the user "Ivan" inquires (the spelling is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the "Fedorenkov" request.
The Federal Security Service recently threw up a huge network of stuck websites, and people who wish to buy a military weapon can be raked up with a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military intelligence and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraněc
I have heard about such schemes: websites are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian law.
People are taking orders.
The buyer makes payment through an ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions with instructions where the gun is hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO "Right to the Weapon."
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain without a gun and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying an illegal firearm, you will pay, according to experts, an amount usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitry Kislov of the non-governmental organization "Right to a Weapon" you will get a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to a month for up to one and a half months.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle article.
According to the official statistics office, compared to the period January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of clarified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in U.S.
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through work at the "McDonald" cash register
In recent days, a wave of protests in America has risen against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave, or whether it will soon be destined to disappear.
This whole share is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries received by rank-and-file workers in Walmart and in fast-food systems, the goal of protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their trade unions.
Today, this economic sector is practically untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday," when an orgy of cheap sell-offs struck America, engulfed millions of residents and, in some cases, was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, where 2.2 million people worldwide work, have left their workplaces and demonstrated together with unions and left-wing activists of multinational chain companies whose goods are destined for people from the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many employees with low wages in Walmart stores only buy at work.
The availability and assortment of goods have made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because he pays little for his employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or handheld scanners.
Protesters on "Black Friday" demanded a pay rise, complaining that the cost of health insurance provided by the company had risen sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart worker receives 9.5 dollars per hour, but that doesn't match the amount of expenses, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It's an average of 1.1% more than the company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart shifts wage increases fully to the arms of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend approximately 12.39 dollars more than today.
Walmart's advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should not cause virtually any damage to society.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 a.m. on Thursday night until midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 items of goods per second.
In total, her cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-leaning website of the Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left the jobs, and that the protest was all "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart department stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular and therefore almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says it sells billions of portions, and then it doesn't even pay you sick pay and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and with New York State regulations is 7.25 dollars per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually raising that wage, but only slightly, and on average, their rank-and-file workers in New York are getting 8.90 dollars an hour.
No one has a lower wage in this expensive city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers who work behind the counter after school on part-time and live with their parents will be employed by "McDonald."
Few people see their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I constantly meet in conversation with "McDonald" workers who complain that they have to live off that money and sometimes even feed their children from them.
On the other hand, a comment hangs on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at "McDonalda" on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks in fast-food businesses begin receiving at least 15 dollars an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits administration from preventing the establishment of trade unions and punishing trade union activists with bullying and layoffs.
On the other hand, governance rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is difficult to introduce trade unions in fast-food establishments even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, noisy protests were also held in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The climax of that event was at noon a gathering at "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, especially City Council member Jumaane Williams, spoke out, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't even pay you sick and pays you properly for your honest work!"
The protesters also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must jointly speak out in support of fast-food workers to achieve the fair reward for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended, though far from all of them were fast-food employees who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will spark the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has managed to mislead on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies, the popular theme of augmented reality is; recently, this means perceiving the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At its annual conference in early the summer, Google unveiled a working model of this news, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent application.
The interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft Sharam Izadim Cambridge Laboratory shows that glasses are already a thing of the past for the company’s scientists.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in a framework what your research group is dealing with?
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has been stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone, the control option with gestures is very interesting.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow is not particularly.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to get to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but doesn't it overestimate itself?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about the swung, just about such scuffy, short ones.
The gestures would not be taken down by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, for example, a gesture + a voice.
- And how?
- How, for example, will you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or cannot at any given time?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's mutual bonding.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation – this is what we can reflect from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, but as matrix and depth.
With the current view on the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data streams of 30 frames per second are frankly a little short, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond has made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delays of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects a person’s interaction with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some frames per second extra.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now being used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of a reflected signal.
And already the third camera - this is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog system Kinect, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present its glasses publicly.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "transferable" form of the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone, projection display and further around on the basis of the clouds platform.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, in this is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man" but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the other hand as a certain kind of substrate for displaying.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding tangible to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic beams at a defined point where the finger is located, it evokes a tactile feeling, but it's still very weak - as if you were blowing on your tummy's fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive your brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here comes another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, practically endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all such as in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If deception of the brain becomes a goal, then work is still for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in the utter beginnings.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront, are an avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already important figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and on openings.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are on display, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg narrators, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's and early 90's.
In addition to being an urban man, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the face of citizens, raising everyone's mood.
He recently picked up a bottle and became a St. Petersburg bottler, because he had matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city all in red and not in yellow or, for example, in turquoise?
- I chose red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although, in general, everything that is just a little different from gray, stirs up aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at having a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand that you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my journey is.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the artists of the new wave, the post-Gazonevs, who brought us to the "Pushkin 10", and there were no other waves.
I am attracted to theatre, dress, music, all genres except the word.
- And all this merged in your art-clinic...- For me, it was important to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a place on Pushkinská 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, a home of a St. Petersburg bohemian before the reconstruction.
That's where many were born:NOM, Tequila Jazz, don't forget how Snur brought in with the "Uch Van Gogh" project.
Both Šnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in tight-fitting leotards, in the middle among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, thus beginning his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of the Art Clinic.
This is where our workers and regular guests left.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In 2000, a survey was held in the press, a special prize was "People in Our City."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed, that ended my peak.
In new times according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity today are different things, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your works are characterized by a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings – these are hits in which topicality and penetrability are vividly captured.
I'll have a program exhibition "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, today being like that is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns, everything is blurred, the tragedy is taken.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguise in the Order of Procedure.
Today, people meet by clothes, orienting themselves to external mechanics, not to the inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
- We saw you recently in the role of a city bottler.- A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be him if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
In the past, people gathered in clusters, the bohemian loved one, the simple other people.
Today everything has broken down on micro-company, today it is very hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you will like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And there's a few thousand spectators coming to Stasu Mikhailov!
- He's going to get fans, that's where the sexually social sphere is involved.
And 300 people will come to the cultural ground and 10 thousand will not come, and the result is less management, money, everything is withering.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and violates what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on the wall with Falk and Larion.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say:Clergy culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's from elsewhere.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money for drawing paintings.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's scarce in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
However, not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the ordinary Tsars, this was not the case in everything, the Tsars may not have understood culture very well, but they understood that real experts needed to be supported.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg, we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked in somewhere in the corner, because great experts are needed, who will properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, tastefulness thrives.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think is St. Petersburg?
- Stereburg - this is not the capital of culture, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is the right soil.
And on our eel, the art thrives poorly.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers than readers today, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are inquisitive, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable affair, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Give birth in space
The country is in danger.
A global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board are embarking on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in weightlessness or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be learned, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Sternberg (SAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But while there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It is only possible to live there at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space began with scientists with flora.
Experiments on plants were carried out half a century ago.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
After that, the insects were carried out into orbit - the very small fruit flies of Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to verify how the weightless embryo develops.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the climb.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find a foothold, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN.
If they don't find a foothold, the birds fall chaotically and make cormels.
After 10 hours, the freshly hatched birds experienced a complete demise of instincts.
The birds did not react to the light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died within four days.
"Twice we've let the birds hatch, but then we've turned it down because it's just impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev said.
The last "mini-arch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but there will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats, who were already pregnant in space.
They didn't really find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats were born offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough task.
Animals, when the usual environment is lost, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest danger was Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Tchaika flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if the flight to space would last.
Whether he can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered that question yet," says Vachtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space sector.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, the first female-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolaev.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savicka was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few astronauts who have been born and grow healthy offspring after long years.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valeriy Polyakov.
Nevertheless, humanity must inevitably look for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the formation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero-attraction conditions, astronauts acquire the habits necessary to work in an open universe.
Water mimics the weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable but in a way a strange environment, it is a natural element for young children.
Small ichtians appear to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and that it is then easier for them to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little for the baby to forget anything," says newborn baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if the state of weightlessness is more natural for a newborn baby, then for women, the inevitable gravity, the attractive force, is more natural.
In the state of weightlessness, the withering of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvic muscles, decreases the ability of the body to expel the fetus.
We can leave this aside if muscle activity stimulators work during childbirth.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber, in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What next?" asks Valeriy Polyakov of the complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the earth's attraction does not affect the body, it cannot properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
A newborn in orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
"If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unsuited to the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP bioethics committee.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
But one day there will come a time when it will become a reality and when the Earthlings will go in their ships to a long planet that will become the home of their descendants born in the universe.
Head of the SAO: Control of the Švarcsystem failed due to politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says this.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what's missing in our country in my opinion," Kala said.
A common control of Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
As an example of malpractice, he cites Petr Nečas's approach to the so-called "švarcsystem".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother businessmen with his controls - is he forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be set up somehow, and if it bans something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has the obligation to go to control and enforce duties," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation regulates how to deal with public procurement, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and although the control is not yet complete, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect" in our country, but the practice itself is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create ever more precise rules, but it is necessary to devote yourself to the application of the law itself.
What can this project help you with, what does it mean for you?
Such joint control could contribute to stopping the effort to refine the law, lowering and improving the limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economics means getting the right thing to do for a reasonable (but that does not always mean the lowest) price in order to exclude enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by lowering the order limit, we don't necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system will become so crowded with "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw them much more easily from it than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is the office similar to our SAO here, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, as the SAO operates there Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized similarly to us, also has a college, only it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed similarly.
The powers are also similar to some extent, but by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these courts at the level of individual Länder - in this the system is a little different from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, represented by state resources in our country.
Public funds, which are managed by the region and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
As for the legislation, it is easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better at everything.
Is it because they have better controllers?
I certainly don't, but I say again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it has to be said that even countries that we consider a role model are facing a number of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no benefit to them to cooperate with our office, wouldn't it?
As for the domestic legislation, what the amendment to the Public Procurement Act meant for your office, are its effects already manifested in some way?
Due to the fact that the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet reflected in the auditing actions.
Because we do ex-post checks, we need to take into account some delays.
We are only observing this in the process of preparing future inspections - we have started our new tool "detection of the risks of inefficientness", through which we have run almost 14 thousand public contracts, and we have analyzed them - there, of course, those changes will manifest themselves, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted, and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law rather as a benefit, or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracies?
I think this bill is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will "tighten" and it will not be possible to follow them.
Already with the operation of the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth tightening the law in this way?
Not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road doesn't go.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs by checking that so-called "svartssystem" - and what does that mean?
Is the Švarcsystem prohibited or permitted?
After all, the law must be set up somehow, and if it bans something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but it can't say we're going to do like nothing.
There are fairly strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on what is to be formally done - which is right to protect public tender.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a bidder with the best offer is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think is missing from us.
The roads are frozen in places, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
But most of the time, the roadways are passable, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region this morning the roads were passable, but sometimes frozen and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but is expected to warm slightly during the day.
Snowfall in the region has stopped and there is only a weak layer in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is around 30 inches of snow.
There was also lower visibility due to fog, according to data from the dispatching of regional road workers.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads are now passable in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
On them, however, in some sections still lie the remains of frozen and sometimes drifting snow.
Especially in higher positions, it is necessary to pay extra attention to driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icing, in higher positions and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, informs the Directorate of Roads and Motorways on its website.
Road workers warn drivers of icing, it can form especially in higher positions of the Pardubice region.
The ice can be in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
The roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are treated chemically.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is most often clear to half-clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, blowing a light wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, but sometimes with caution and the ride must be adapted to the weather.
This is freezing in the morning, temperatures range between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
In places, drivers must also expect fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the dispatching of the regional road workers.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, but the road managers between 80 and 131 kilometres recommend caution.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, there may be frozen sections in the southern Pilsen and Tachov regions.
Second- and third-class communications are damp, and also in this case, warnings about frozen sections apply.
Drivers should be especially careful on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Today, snow mashes on the road must be counted on by drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region.
After the chemical sprinkle, she remained on the Červenohorské saddle and on the way in the direction of the Videl Cross.
The roadmen were driven into the field by snowfall at night, snowing about three centimeters in the Šumperk region, according to the road managers.
In other parts of the country, roadways are mostly passable without restrictions.
"In the Šumperk region, the remains of snow lie in the highest positions.
With the snow on the Červenohorské saddle, drivers must count in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Šumperk Road Administration told the Czech News Agency today.
Their colleagues also went into the field at night in the Jesenice region, the paths to the highest positions are now, according to them, after chemical treatment bare and wet.
In the Olomouc region, roads are passable without restrictions, but in the Šternberk region, drivers should be careful in the forest sections, where the roadways remained wet.
Usti nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult places to pass are reported today in the morning by road workers in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or glaciers, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí region is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept even in lower positions below zero, so both ice and snow will probably last on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications are not yet reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by road workers, especially from around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and melting snow during the day, clear and frosty at night.
Unfavorable conditions are also reported from the main routes on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees, which bent to the road under the snow.
Šimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we humans like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also organize a unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national benefit event that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20, from 21 o'clock, 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Canceled."
She is already very popular on YouTube today, will she also hear at these benefit concerts?
Of course, in the very end, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will also suddenly connect in a unique live stream on Czech Television.
He wrote the words about this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you get into cooperation with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and entertained by cooperation with us.
What will the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world go to?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute school regularly run out of lecturers and engage in activities that entertain and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
Within the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar “bombastic events” for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the USA, I would like to connect it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, so far you have performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group that consists of handicapped people.
How do you manage these paths logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric wheelchair, her trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, further, of course, we carry a large number of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, both CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, that I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in barrier-freeness, public access to handicapped and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything in the east is still in the very beginning.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-winging, here it is still unusual for a person to move on an electric wheelchair himself in the city center.
There are not even such obvious things, as that, for example, wheelchair users prefer in the elevator.
Fortunately, civic associations are already being established there, which are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we still have to catch up with more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in which, on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, will things really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back a few years ago, what made you want to start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlička Institute as an educator, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play, among other things, on the saxophone, so together with a colleague I founded a hobby music club.
Well, over time, as our presenter Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity came only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We realized that a job that is not visible, basically as if it didn't exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it with The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is crowded with things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in a way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that is natural...
But that regret is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all abandoned beings that we have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary resources to do so.
I say that if something succeeds with people with disabilities, it is not just a shift for them, but for the whole society.
Did it also help that success that you are a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the rehearsal twice a week, go to the product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
The band The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people leave and come, that can't be prevented.
Whoever has the will and the taste always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 o'clock
It will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will connect with the telemost at the end of the evening while singing the song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Canceled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the volume of 25 million CZK
Admission to the concert is 400 Kč, children under 12 years old have free tickets in advance sale Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, Poland was accepted as a member of the European Space Agency as the twenty-first member of the European Space Agency, the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of agency projects over the following years.
However, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had been involved in flights to space before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, of lecture A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work, the Entry into Space.
The Ideas of a Young Engineer (b. 1905) left the listener cold and after years of Šternfeld remembered that only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelteri and André Louis Hirsch Award for his entry into spacecraft in France.
The remembered doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous space promoter, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925, a rail dress was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
Nor is it clear whether the rocket was to be used to start the dressage or to brake it.
Information about this dressage is known only from the contemporary press.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to deal with missiles.
The research was provided by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegim.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research reached the stage of practical examinations.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter missile, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work of Rakieto - torpedo powietrzna and the rakietobomb of the lotnicza author Leliwa-Krzywoblocké was published.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects of military use of missile technology were dedicated to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activities ceased the start of the war.
Other works devoted to spacecraft appear after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Towarzystwo Astronautyczne.
The first mention is in the November issue of the 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, in which there are four more comprehensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, from prof. M. Subotowicz, is proposed the creation of a company that will deal with spacecraft.
At that time, the projects of artificial satellites were already underway and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaus Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn, PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which became the first Polish missile to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start was 10. October 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high-rise wind.
In 1962, however, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a 0.4-litre space, a 0.34-litre Meteor-1B and a 0.62-litre Meteor-1C were available.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in the research of outer space on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic departments, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labour, (wages) there is a price tension.
Under this term, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer tries to compete by importing cheap goods by "undermining" the price of a competitor in order to tear down a greater market share and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means either translating production abroad for most entrepreneurs, or buying cheaply there, or disappearing.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus a responsibility for the unemployment produced by it, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is enhanced by the complete unwillingness of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social and social damages caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into competition with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital their own population regardless of social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force the population to adopt the price dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done both by a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and by limiting the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food dispensaries for the poor for many years, who cannot make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already going into the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are quite commonly cases where properly employed people receive such a wage that the state must pay them an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of the auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation when people under the pressure of a disastrous decline in the social level are forced to either emigrate as was the case in the 19th century or live on hungry wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital will perhaps come to the country someday.
But here it is necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African still work for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media, until they are tired, argue that the state cannot participate capitalically in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists that the State must not interfere with the economy through management interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect, now it actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer that it is.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, the provision of mutual advantages, legislation, where practically everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that the state ministries, for lack of funds, enter the drafting of bills to private legal firms that are heavily related to industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people as proclaimed by Western-type constitutions, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
Clearly, liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation, as described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in complete disarray, and the authorities have occupied themselves with violence.
For bribes, unlawful acquisition of favor and with the help of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice" ..."characteristic people did not apply for the office at all, so once, as a result of this disruption, the state was without consuls for eight months". “It has indeed begun to be said that the only medicine in a bad situation is self-government, and that an energetic man must be chosen.” Appiános thought of Pompey, but it was Caesar who turned democracy into self-government.
Conclusion As in antiquity, contemporary society is based on a reckless preference for its own benefit regardless of society-wide interest.
Private capital is by its very nature unable to understand and apply society-wide benefit.
The result is now, as is then, the unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort to reform a deeper nature.
The causality of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalization of 19th and 20th century economic systems.
Under the current situation, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal-type democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing along with crimes against humanity as we know them from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the capital participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The chaos lab.
"Nothing comes out of violence and never can" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are"

After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have swarmed.
One stands behind Israel, arguing its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is the culprit in the periodically repeated waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
It is about offering readers a view behind the curtain, a view of who has been serving for the 95-year-old tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are supported by available historical facts some of them are derived from their own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find some Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomously directing their steps or whether someone behind their throne stood behind their throne, who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the life of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stand out one that might consider itself the head of an octopus (if anyone is still standing over them I don't know, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschields.
There's not much written about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought in the 1990s to stop combining their name with the highly criminal deeds in which they stood and which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all central banks in the world and against countries where shares in the central bank are not fought or are preparing wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the central bank to the Rothschield Bank of America, began issuing his own (understandably government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was murdered in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression of 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars by the highest-level, 33rd degree dedicated to Albert Pike.
The first war was intended to remove the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial estate of Great Britain in particular, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a forefield for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschields, works is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, so that the crisis like the one they provoked in 1907) does not happen again.
So, after the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they managed to start the First World War, destroying Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended in the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy the Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the Central European Power, Austria of Hungary, was fragmented.
For the easier unleashing of the Second World War, the bankers of politics had a latently conflicted situation created by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, creating a precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses and then just to give the Germans a strong enough, culprit-winning and simple solutions of the offering of the Fuhrer and the creation of a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields incited the founding of the Zionist movement, whose one branch sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created the precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler broke off the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or everything he did planned, is hard to guess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations of Germany, was invaded by World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the outbreak of war a third.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, like the latter, will be the victims on the front line of the fighting, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let's just take into account how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice begets wrong in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything stood the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like in our country, international bankers give people to choose their own candidates in elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, a politician who is doing everything he can to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to grow into a global conflict and, given the control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of the world’s oil.
What is the light of what the words David Rockefeller said in 1994 now appear: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that will make him a totally controlled being.
"And he compels all small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, that they may have a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, that he may not buy or sell, who is not marked with the name of the beast or the number of his name.
This must be understood: who has reason, let him add up the digits of the beast.
That number indicates a man, and it's number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When the worst is to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlavi, who fled to the U.S. after the revolution, which had been the patron saint of his regime for several decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - throwing the Shah overboard could not afford, because it would so fundamentally jeopardize trust in allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later exacerbated by the fiasco of an attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after the Algerian government brokered the negotiations.
Their lot at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film by director Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of that history that brought America a minor victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from it.
After complex peripates, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew, who in the country surveyed the locations for the shooting of a big-fined sci-fi movie.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, a betrayal - an example of this is the Danny's partnering series.
The film alternates moods - on the one hand, documentary sequences from Tehran (in the subtitle sequence are shown iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, light passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - the men in the suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, in the telephone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable reboot of his career.
The mock actor became a respected director, and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film, not taking place in the director's hometown of Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films exalted above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also showing it in Argo, where Tehran is "playing" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occur when history moves out of nowhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in scenes fictional (fake crew at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer much in the film sense of thrilling scenes.
She almost works with it quite successfully, sometimes she thinks something about reality - everything doesn't work out so elegantly there anymore (the scene in which the impending crisis at the Tehran airport turns away a phone call in America and the chase after the runway looks pretty far-fetched).
But the weakness of Argo is distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film somewhat loses its dramatic turn, it's a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking thrillers of the 70's.
But it's hard to pull.
As a reminder of one still living history, as well as a testament to how exaggerated the notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but sufficient.
Rules for balloon inflating, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU" workshop.
"We were led to this by the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of major European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the poll.
Among the nominees of absurdities is, for example, the European Court's recent decision to unify insurance rates for men and women.
So far, women have been advantaged by life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulation includes, for example, the mandatory addition of biofuels, which is harmful to nature, as a result, the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substance, or a directive on the size of chicken cages, due to which it has significantly increased the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on the use of the term spread butter or the elimination of classic light bulbs from sale has also faced criticism.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now enforces the demands of its banks with the threat of veto).
The lobby's interests were also behind the fact that, for example, high-quality bananas had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to exhibit "anomal curvature."
The European Commission has defended itself by merely harmonising existing inconsistent national norms that have complicated trading.
The EU has already softened fruit and vegetable standards despite the opposition of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which it must be mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 must not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to U.S. research that balloons between toys are the leading cause of children’s deaths from suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 when blowing into pilgrimage sniffs.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule on European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire has nominated the EU Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that may have been located in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for canned mushrooms, for which he was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for the application for a subsidy.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are handicapped by the fact that we do not have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," Jaroslav Palas, the then Minister of Agriculture, said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state was supposed to be full of warehouses, which he had to export.
The EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic to continue to ports, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission came out of the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant for obtaining the subsidy was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily criticised in Member States, EU efforts to regulate and at the same time to make the Union more functioning and development more easily deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions among Czechs are also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products in Brussels, while not always succeeding in this struggle.
Although the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc cheeses after a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs had to rename domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename it.
The name rum can only be carried by products from cane spirit, and not from sugar beet.
The official list of registered EU products includes, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, Pohořelický and Třeboň carp and Žatec hops in the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, and Parma hams.
The EU safety mark can also be used in Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do you think he wants to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country stealing from the last twenty years, how thieves run around, people's taxes and retirement age increase.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm forty years old and I'm an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you soon went to the castle.
You're not turning your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle according to the outcome of the Senate election.
I later specified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool how I can realize my vision.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
But the trouble is not only that as a nation we scold in a pub and at television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to make a change.
This will be joined by the media that dishonests a person and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
I was said to bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
You went to the fight for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the retroactive property returns of more than twenty million.
To do this, you have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How are you going to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for the guideship to be a free trade, it was enforced.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, it is deliberately rejected, and that delays the citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
For me, it doesn't matter at all whether a little to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it's important that we go forward.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose the bad idea.
You get dressed when someone says you're a populist.
But you don't prove it with what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts have spoken about them.
But without the support of parliament, you'll only have passwords left.
And you can't do that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to assert, for example, criminal and material liability?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to enforce it.
If I were elected president, there is no problem holding a television live broadcast, where I will ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to enact substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will name the insouciances, one can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, that was a credit to public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, that I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to find allies.
I've only just started in politics and I'm going to try to get the majority support for my program.
I try to push things myself, if I can't, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, that's why I've been bypassing a number of well-known people to see if they would run for Senate either.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud with light heating oils.
I've run for office with people being really dissatisfied, but I'm on a bit now.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who went mostly elected the establishment representatives.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have voted the Senate so that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven't considered that yet because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential party member, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20 grand in my transparent account.
Don't you have money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artworks for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Škoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against bad things and mischief.
You drive Aston Martin, you have 60 million dollars' worth of property and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million to campaign.
I'm supposed to be in debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors is indicative of the fact that my program is probably not so interested.
And I have no obligation to campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign will basically cover what kind of senatorial salary I'm getting.
But I wouldn't live off him, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30 grand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd suppress these activities?
But that has nothing to do with the salary.
As promised, I partially subdued my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the travel director in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I need to live off something, too.
How much were you used to take as an entrepreneur per month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take next.
And if I were president, I'd shut down my business.

The MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don't just happen in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"The building looks fun, it looks futuristic. Finally, there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
I wonder why we need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to any of these old-style libraries today, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, several years ago, the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councillors recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of insanely bold bar charts and a contractor of funny, often even cynical buildings, accepted the matter with the usual calm, and at a competition meeting in 2003 he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around in stunny and shrugging its shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled his gifts on top of each other according to size and ended his activistly reasoned speech with the words "Dear towns!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was piled up for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
The small-town grey, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is, thanks to this, richer in a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural structure in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: a reading eldorado under a cheese hatch.
The resort of the mountain mass is the elevator, but you will discover real spatial and reading passions only when you walk topography.
From all sides the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor of a burnt cabin and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space that is mostly incozy and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and we ejected the space for the reader from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is cleverly used: on Wednesday there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a control panel of house technology.
A special delight is the black shelves for books, which are once the lining of the walls, once the windowsill and other times the railing of the stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Even sworn architects and civil engineers shake their heads over unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so, in one of the Friesian farms, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture one day.
For many years, a millimeter fleece of synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots of greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons and then is ripe to throw away in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - was pressed onto a plate with a thickness of four centimetres.
The effect of heat and pressure turns so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will reach the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficuls in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the correct humidity in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is, despite many glass surfaces, a sample project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It heats up and cools with the earth's heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as a shading and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can handle fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial IT business skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
Thus, optical gaps in the previously not fully equipped library, which currently consists of 70 000 pieces, should be filled.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are completely full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-declised library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This is how MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in deciding on the adoption of Palestine.
According to US-Europe relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is on the edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany initially signalled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
Berlin then abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is currently changing its foreign policy, towards a policy that was, so to speak, controlled by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just getting settled in their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, as they have in France or the UK.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the readiness to take positions in the case of national interests, which are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and by its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of other superpowers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests have an impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has major outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to deter the public, but also to the elites in Arab countries.
That plays a role anyway.
But I wouldn’t want to attach too much importance to it, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German reasoning.
Did Germany's relations with the US be damaged when Germany abstained in the case of both important decision-makings, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German attitude in Europe and even in the US.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic a turning point as on the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
This signals that it must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly spoken out in favour of the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think the Obama administration probably has a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, he cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I think the differences in opinions are not really as great at all as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans to have a coherent and consistent European policy, which is not currently happening.
They cannot be part of a wider line and instead have to drive things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he even want to take the lead role?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes a bigger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.
The US's influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum. Who else is left?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable with it and it'll make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
This is due to the designation, which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they enjoy protection until they are sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it's unclear whether they can get the rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the office of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in trademark infringements in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
Forgers just need a few extra letters to log in their tags.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they will have Prada-Kny registered.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of Puma sporting goods, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens the binder with records of the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the Zegna DF Puma brand. An artificial name that parasitizes even on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and intellectual property violations.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
But Pattloch's cases are different. On behalf of his mandates, he opposes Chinese companies receiving from the trademark office the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
This means women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging the trade, we have to fight it," Pattloch urges.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
Financial losses and court costs of affected industries go into the millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to data from the CLSA market research company, China, with a volume of 15 billion euros in a year, is the third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing at its fastest pace.
However, it is difficult to delete questionable records in the register of brands and it costs something.
The proceedings can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch recounts cases where the court dismissed the lawsuits because the accused name became a "market reality" after a long period of duration.
When the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Well-known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sana, a business that recently took over the German producer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
The Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
While the CTMO trademark admits that there were shortcomings there in 2010 because of too few employees and premises.
But last year, he reportedly "the course of the work process returned from an emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed objection proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still, 81 500 complaints about the handling are still pending at the office.
Anything against it is expensive to do
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, nearly a third more than 2010.
That's a record, and it means China is running a list of new applications around the world for the 10th consecutive time.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected on fees.
In simple terms, each login costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
The dispute is several times the case, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The Germans achieved the fact that its illegal production of imitated automotive parts was canceled.
However, the counterfeiter has retained Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget this ourselves, because in Germany the surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark also rejected the Munich firm’s objection.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg won the law, but the opponent continues to fight the dispute to this day.
You have to be very careful
The matter is now being heard in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will bring a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "Management is extremely costly and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archives, they even had to inspect the hundred-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party in vain a "high six-figure amount in euros" to settle the dispute.
"You can see from that what it means to us," Wentzler says.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will also affect Europe.
And that's when the impersonators get unprotected marks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to sign up for the Freudenberg designation for footwear and leather in Germany.
The Group gave up this area of business activity long ago, yet managed to avert registration.
"We need to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and his lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Foreigners would rather have "everything worth protecting in any way, to apply even in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of its drama, then it will probably have to pay the counterparty royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Corps is trying out - and in Swaziland, orphans are happy about it after their parents who died of AIDS.
A story of a connection that surpasses far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's the stomping: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's loafers are looking for tact on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly rise up - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are redy, moms and prosecuted.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it from his textile boots as he unleans the voices with his supply wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69, from a human genetics researcher to a housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every choir voice has a different text and, moreover, in a very foreign language - zula spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotha, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Helping to self-help
Unaids, a United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV live.
Of these, 23.5 million live in the south of Africa.
There are 245 000 orphans in Swaziland after their parents who died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans after their parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second-grade school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, patronage can be taken over.
He guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "narrator of stories" or "he who praises" in the language of zulu.
No one can speak gas in this space, just sing.
For almost a decade, he has been practicing choir songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing them back to where they originally came from: the south of Africa.
At an air distance of 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Swaziland kingdom is the village of Esitjeni, which is dependent on the massiveness of the voices of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected
There are about 2000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjen, the small, what the stand of the whole of Swaziland is seen: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity within themselves. It is not rare that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by the congregation during a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but all: food, clothing, education.
Without a school education, they have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private deployment of individuals, who, for a few euros a year, allowed to send the child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, the choir of the association "Voices for Africa" was founded, which has since taken care of orphans from parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Muňky and scabies are among the parasitic SPIs.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute concludes that at least four of the five cases of syphilis that have been reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people who are newly infected with HIV are infected with this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more often than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases should be reported.
The number of infected with syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That's roughly one-tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms point to STD?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty in urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The dangers of infection can reduce condoms, but they do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable gifts and, last but not least, the royalties earned by the choir by singing all over Germany, will collect some money.
"We have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjen," says Annette Lennartz, chairwoman of the association.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can assert herself.
He also takes care of orphaned children finding shelter, for example, at one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as old women are called in the language of zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children arrive every day in time in uniforms for school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman paid by the association as well as two cookbooks, who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a school of sewing, built two chicken coops and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had their HIV test done.
That's not a matter of course. Even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, quite strange in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immense lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but nobody uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To support the cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi choir travels once every two, three years together in the south of Africa and sings songs full of grief, combativeness, confidence in the future and the self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know even from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award not only brings mood and joy, but also has already brought out tears in many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on the maps, it is more than famous in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjen, there's light," people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is 8733 kilometers from here, to the trampling singers in the rehearsal room on the Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 metres thick.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday by the professional magazine "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the area of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It is reportedly at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters thick.
This water apparently came from comets, or perhaps even from asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
But let’s not put the ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said lead scientists working on Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us clarify how water and other essential elements of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved Earthlings, are taking part in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, small windows to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic instrument developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, except the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which circles the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" under the new conceptual definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This cut-out from the Spitzer telescope's infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, harder to identify are the pink-colored "newborns" in the birthing hall of the stars.
This region where stars are formed - scientists call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This shifting heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The muffinous ring consists of a material that the star threw out during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid nebula, which is 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from the gas and dust.
The photo of the galactic "cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The Cluster of the Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, the colors will stand out better.
The Helix nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to the earthly continent has earned this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the origin of an extraordinary coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was able to scan in full glory the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they came into being is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Telescope: the vortex galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The footage, published by the European Southern Observatory, depicts the Trifid Nebula, several thousand light-years distant, in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trical), because the dark strips of dust divide the glowing heart of this star maternity hospital into three parts.
In the constellation of Snakefish, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are coming at each other, and a collision must inevitably occur.
This birth of a star was recorded by the Huble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical shortcuts can call it the South Windmill.
A photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a cutout of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefea.
This 1400-light-year-long nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula, the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way is located.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever new additions.
Also, these star clouds, connected to the Rosette Nebula, are giving birth to new young stars. They are 5000 light-years from Earth.
There is no dust, but only gas, in this bright galaxy with a small black hole.
Scientists believe it originated only shortly after the Big Bang when there was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Even before Galileo Galilee, he used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever widener - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to peer into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Still, its diameter is about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equals the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecib (Portorico), scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner can help, which will make its computing power available.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It stands here the Very Large Telescope - and honors its name.
This telescope, with a total of four mirrors, can also shine through the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to be 42 meters full and consists of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Images can be counted on in 2018 at the earliest.
Two of Keck's telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, views the universe using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be built a new giant telescope - with a thirty-foot diameter of the mirror.
You can admire it in the picture here.
The most important impressions of the universe, however, are conveyed to us by the Hubble Space Telescope.
It has been providing us with distanced worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - primarily those that are habitable.
2. February 2011 NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The image documents the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
James Webb's Space Telescope (JWST) will be fired into space aboard the Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe there is ice at Mercury's South Pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger circles this planet far closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurement has been pointing for decades to the fact that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The Talysh Mountains can be called wild romantic.
The microbus rumbles along the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple peasant buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems we're in the Black Forest.
This is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talysh, about which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and lives to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. The arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-lane.
The fairy-tale wealth for which the country owes diesel in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the opportunity to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world here next year," says Fatulajeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the life of nearly eight dozen Talysh from around here is documented, who are over the age of a hundred. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still fathered a child.
The disputed star of this museum, however, is the shepherd of the sheep Şirali Müslümov, who reportedly was 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he said he fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov not make a mistake at his age by a few decades?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of age-old people in Central Asia.
"Conspicuously many people of old age also live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when registers are missing.
A glass of melted butter every day
But the fact is that people in the area around Leric live to a biblical age conspicuously often.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many long-standing people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the strange genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatulyeva Museum, on the other hand, believes that it consists of nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy does not seem to be very credible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a plain wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterfly that he relentlessly roasts.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter. Both have long been grandparents.
There are also two young children around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in typical belly glasses of "armad".
Mirzayevy's white teeth form the perfect line and under the scarf hides a long dark blonde copy, which is proudly revealed from us by her son.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like me and kept my color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
A monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven't bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the Second World War.
But everything improved when the oar was taken over by "beloved father" Geidar Aliyev.
The propaganda sounds strange from the old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is being made around the figure of the father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
The elderly in Azerbaijan at least do not suffer from the need.
Mirzayeva receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is, by the circumstances of the locals, an amount from which to live well.
And perhaps even Mirzaeva's long-gray son is right: "Old people enjoy great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for and happy.
Unless there's a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is lacking in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The disputed demonstrations in Cairo have exposed the country's deep ambivalence.
There is a sharp debate about the future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We have to make a transition.
"And for succeeding, I am responsible, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly quarreled in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a "state of God" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said he had temporarily limited the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral degree at the University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about that.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which the hundred-headed Constituent Assembly, with the predominance of Islamists, hastily approved in the 15-hour night marathon, partly raise concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principle" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that the Islamists will use this unclear wording and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this is illuminated by the newly added paragraph: In all matters concerning Sharia, it is necessary to consult with the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
This may not, but may mean that the clergy will supervise the legislation, which would bring the justices a de facto withdrawal of legal capacity.
There is a lot of interpretation in the draft constitution
The problem is also that the civilian jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11 000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values."
This is so inaccurately worded that, using this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In understandable language, this means nothing but censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph defines in writing the explicit equality between men and women.
However, another paragraph prohibits the defame or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
But what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
In this case, is the caricature of the president or a joke on behalf of the experts of the law already sufficient?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular voting.
"The revolution has returned"
For weeks now, opposition to the superiority of Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual conclusion on Friday night in Cairo's Tahrir Square and pledged to destroy the constitutional charter before it even came into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranked third in the presidential election.
Nobel Prize winner and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej said the draft constitution belonged "to the dustbin of history."
Through the short-range news service, Twitter accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition member Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a de-demonstration, out of caution, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile outside Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who shouted, "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They challenged Morsi: "Clean up the earth!" and assured, "The Quran is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which it all began, would probably trigger a state similar to a civil war.
Apparently, Morsi's supporters didn't want to take that chance.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents and proponents of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box decide which way the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur even once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is yelling Hafiz Abu Sa'da.
The forty-eight-year-old human rights defender and chairman of Egypt's Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or stood trial.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that, he was beaten, convicted and jailed.
"And in the new constitution now, the words 'human rights' are not even once," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi's expansion of power to all three power forces in the state has forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da feels abandoned even by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That might backfire on him.
The protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norway's Rakfisk: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily smelling fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it lying down for a week.
This will give you a smell of paralysing the smell of the raffisk, one of Norway's biggest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a wonderful view - and there's a pervasive smell hanging in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes are starting to meet for a festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, to the most captivating dish.
"You eat it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general," who is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk," Havard says.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled up and ate - the senses no doubt dulled with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and seek work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At the moment, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and a large-scale care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival that was not long ago much richer than Norway, are flowing into the country for work.
The raffisk is viewed as something important, indispensable, though rather smelly part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will come out to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway is often not getting into global news - and it seems to suit most people that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with distaste.
Instead, the shooting is called "the event of 22. July."
Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
Her English, like the English of most of the people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We don't show off, we don't like pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from the sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash was throwing away money they didn't have, the Norwegians wore strings tightly tightened on their pouch.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat the raffisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of the rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But tonight, the smelly fish is here again.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where the rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast in which the presenter with the bow tie is surrounded by plates with a rakfisk.
It's like a Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC is looking at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected, closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive a presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a challenging task.
Mexico has performed well economically at the time of Felipe Calderon's outgoing office, but the country is in the clutches of a drug war that has already taken an estimated 60 000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence," President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
The straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
The albums with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP for the party of President Pen Niet, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We are particularly hoping for interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so badly needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
MP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, much is expected inside the party from Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he rejects the opposition's statement characterizing the new president as a man with no substantial content.
He is a very straightforward person, very intrigued with the excellent vision of the country.
He is a great statesman and, above all, a person who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not an impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotle, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more apparent.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially the burning violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in deserts next to a huge garbage dump.
At the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notorious city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case scenario, Pen Niet's critics say he has failed adequately dealing with the problem of women's murders while working in office.
And at worst, his leadership is accused of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me a photo of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone had washed her body," Ms. Buendia recalled.
There were signs of blows, and the posthumous stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice."
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they have been denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, troublemaker and whiner.
They want you to simply accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sash that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new president has vowed that for the duration of his tenure in office, they will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," PRI MP Olvera says in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, military prosecutor says
Military prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims regarding the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, has missed many chances of complaining about the rough treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor has. Ashden Fein during the cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits Manning had with the unit's officers over nine months of custody in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred during a hearing made at the defense's motion to dismiss the case against Manning because of rough treatment at the time of detention, which is itself a sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then posted online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, passed forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at a detention facility in Quantico, where he was held in high-security mode from July 2010 to April 2011.
The Manning officers asked questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and rated the overall treatment in the facility as "very professional."
The forms show no complaints about mistreatment, although Manning's officers directly asked about how he was treated, Fein argued.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about the various issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about these concerns and indicated that they would address them, but did not notice these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment of his person in January 2011 when meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had previously expressed in a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the regime of "injury prevention."
The military said it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the surveillance regime because of suicide) for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was OK and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life I saw it," Manning said.
Manning on Thursday testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transported to a detention facility at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and once fainted there because of heat.
He stated that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very daunting.
"My world only shrunk to the base of Arifjan, to that cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said that upon arriving in Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, slippers, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the regulations during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from outside the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manninga also asked about the charges he made in Thursday's testimony regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his Quantico cell naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow inmates during the morning counting.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when counting.
In an interrogation on Friday by Judge Manning, he said he had decided, by order of his guards, that he had a blanket that could be covered, but admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use the belt from his underwear or his slippers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his slippers and glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience in the course of his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before a military court, the beginning of which is expected to begin at the beginning of next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense said it plans to plead Manning guilty in lower crimes and that he will fight the other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend detention terms as justified.
The Pentagon said a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all those arrested in custody with maximum security.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security, and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged on all counts, he can be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they are reminded of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made my way through the crowd and arrived in a space for an immigrant agenda where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Strangers").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
So later I ended up with the label "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it wasn't necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I cannot get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and put myself in line for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House this week.
On the agenda, they had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why there is the same likelihood that Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they will travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto has pledged to continue the Mexican war on drug cartels, even though he provided no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of weapons, to rewrite half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over the span of centuries, not minutes, the comments are pervasive.
So a minute after the U.S. official says something just a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite a complaint about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will step up the war path.
And yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There are a lot of them.
In Mexico, the winners and losers, the people to whom the country offers possibilities, and others who don't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, weak education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we are now living the American dream, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living an American dream, not a Mexican one.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is towards the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and view us as an inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bonds to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, in their opinion, only a failure.
If our families in Mexico had not failed, they would never have left it.
And we would not now be trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally traveled to the United States in childhood, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans dislike it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like a part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in either.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And in order to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders want to reconnect with the diaspora, and some of the intelligence, as I learned during my trip.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country, and pressure political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well, well.
That's not going to happen, then.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel displeasure for the way their family members were treated in a considerably closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The end of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such thing is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary conjectures about who started it, many buildings were turned into debris, killed by more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza fell near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians appear to have been stuck in their distant conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and the Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the chaos in the region.
It may cause their fight to be even bloodier than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly deadly deadlock.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there is not much reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21 lasts, the fighting from this week has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most pitiful and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently run by its stubborn rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has made powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that once was Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas. So did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering people of Hamas say that the Islamic crescent is surrounded around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/militia rules, through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism, can depose Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can appear as a player who cannot be excluded even by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a box.
The Israeli missile defense system Iron Dome proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unwavering as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the start of the final round of violence.
And most importantly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, it has been relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombers, partly thanks to the wall that extends into the West Bank, the main part of what a Palestinian state may one day be, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing missiles like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
Perhaps hardline proponents will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than the spending of all its four Arab neighbors combined.
The start of a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economy.
That President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis, too, should look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, it is creating the denial of rights for Palestinians to self-determination of a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - as well as a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating the situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza, which are taking place every few years to push Hamas, will increasingly take a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what the reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper proclaim: two states where Israel will advance territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping fire will give pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this issue.
Egypt, which, along with Turkey and Qatar, must work to stop arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to embrace the idea of a 1967 Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs from outside also have to push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the United Nations to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a piece to do on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant in his entry into the trial.
That's woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packaging have come into force
On unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, warnings are displayed for smokers and sick body parts.
The Australian laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the first of its kind in the world, came into force, replacing the logos and colors of the brands with general olive-green boxes with hideous pictures of sick body parts and the depiction of children and newborns ill as a result of smoking their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, they are mandatory from Saturday the only difference between the boxes of brand names that are printed in the same small font.
It is the most stringent regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by depriving the bad habit of its attraction.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says federal Health Secretary Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that, for example, have shown that children associate a crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry has been lobbying hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have claimed that the law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will result in serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeigers from China and Indonesia will bring in far more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Another says the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned firm, said demand for cigarette packaging made of silicone used to cover up disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals regarding laws to the Australian Supreme Court, rising from near-zero sales.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts cite the popularity of social media in the demographic group targeted by the plan.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and demanding that most vendors hide cigarettes from direct sight, tobacco marketing has shifted online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a tobacco marketing worker and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is an insurmountable place for you to be in," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman has seen an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza."
Do we have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and put in the job and created this video, or is the marketing company involved in that?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how it will handle new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries do commercially significantly with Australia.
The decision of the SOO is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
Many smokers in Australia are resisting.
The pictures have no bearing on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and stick the box back," says Victor El Hage while buying a box with a photo of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in central Sydney, says it's harder for him to level the racks thanks to the single boxes.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them altogether, then we'd say, 'OK, that's over, we're going to shut the shop down,'" he said, throwing his hands around.
In a world of constant connectivity, it's not so bad to be bored
I spent the last Thanksgiving day unexpectedly for five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the scattering with books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts on children's development are increasingly coming with praise for boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we don't have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
Should we encourage boredom?
Yes. Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that has occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011), says.
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription related to boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then the question is how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, John D said. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After watching the research literature and showing the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it."
Boredom differs from apathy by the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about apathy.
He says the core of boredom is "a violation of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and a feeling of slowly passing time."
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read an article from a journal.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they could barely notice it, while the third group could not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, a distraction can lead to boredom, Mark J said. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and doodling, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically more attentive.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to be wagged will learn more and retain more information than those forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom sometimes - the delay of my flight, the humming speaker, the particularly lengthy movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed a "Scale for Susceptibility to Boredom Proneness Scale."
The scale includes questions like, "A lot of things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodnovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "adolescence is a peak time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and youth are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodnovich, who has studied the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is a way of brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing you should do.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to have fun or self-administer, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of our reach of constant thornying of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly over-stimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise shuts down."
There is no manual in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a senior vocational student and footballer from Southeast Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state - for possessing a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was riding with several friends in Lamar, on the plains not far from the Kansas border when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offences, for which there is 100 USD for each fine - and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote to legalize a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the ground rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana violations have already been lifted here and in Washington state, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older for holding small amounts that will be legally allowed after the law goes into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have said they will proceed with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the Denver suburbs towards western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is going so fast I don't know what's going to happen next," Daniel J said. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads.
And they're looking for a guide on how to set up a licensing system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or for worse, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," Brian E said. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State's Alcohol Sales Licenses Council.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can follow," he said.
The Washington law, so-called. I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there is yet to be a state licensing system, but a legal possession yes.
And there are intricate mechanical issues that need to be resolved over the course of this time, such as how to balance the state's directive regarding "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Officer Chief Oates of Aurora sent an email to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offenses for possession of small quantities of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21, and that the police would "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he declared that his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way of pressure on users to seek treatment.
He currently faces charges of possessing 56 grams or less marijuana of 119 people, although many face additional charges.
"Our office is required to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they took place," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places like the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the district's largest city, no longer accuse adults of holding small quantities.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports the decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all ongoing possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have exposed a deep ambivalence among local officials in light of this large state green experiment.
For district attorneys, this is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendants in marijuana possession, and a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states that treat a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are well on their way to becoming national testing cases to legalize the drug.
Defense attorneys and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Lawyers for the legalization of marijuana hope the Justice Department will submit.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana salesmen and patients who use it, which attracted attention, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to knock the door out to catch a small bag of the drug, it is likely that they will resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana stores allowed by the new laws, Kevin A said. Sabet, a former adviser on President Obama's anti-drug policy.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to advance.
Even before the election day, some local governments had approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, although it would take another year before any store could open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and it is likely to come into effect next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we issue a license to someone and then we get a big federal issue out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We look at what the municipality voted for, versus what the state voted for.
There really are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
It is not just today’s university students who are attacked for their views.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world's largest residence of knowledge, a modern wrap-around Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I gave up because I objected to the students' lovemaking in the next room.
The Writer A. N. Wilson said himrously that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran.
Yes, I ran away because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was pursued for one reason, and in this cradle of imagined enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm only pulling this out now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center suffers from a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Junior Years Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College argue that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and shown that they are not welcome."
They are calling for the creation of a position in the University Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they are free to communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary programme Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right.
The show featured a graduate of Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are treated as "scapegoats" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association of Nottingham University, told Sunday's newspaper that "the left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.'
Twenty-one-year-old history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for more protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while nineteen-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in JCR's approach to people to the right since the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the welfare of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of a member.
I started in September 1986, 18-year-old and crippling in a shy way.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most feverish.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to award the honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would tremble with concern about the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students meet each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the wormworm that was to come.
I found out that not only do the professors tacitly approve of the taunting of conservative pupils, but they also take part in it with pleasure.
A policy of mining strike, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa has been brought to the timber-panelled auditoriums.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed was not ready for me.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "place the first paragraph, please."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very bile-like.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your free time, unless you're too busy with social affairs," Professor Pitt growled.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat alone when I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's right.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later in a local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted I didn't agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who (what irony) went to Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students noted with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
He's hitting each other, isn't he?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people just after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me, they unfolded as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being an adviser to Margaret Thatcher on foreign policy and one of those who writes her speeches.
He was almost not there.
He hated the place for his provinciality and pettiness and for his inclination toward a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he took the position of professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes gloomed.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
I'd break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week, during the course of teaching, when another professor of history in complete seriousness declared that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was blushing with shame inside, I confessed that "my parents brainwashed" me and called them "old fools."
The relief was only short-term.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At the time, he was writing two columns each week in Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snotty weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poison in an educational institute.
Even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 Conservative prime ministers emerged, but who, to this day, is also hiding behind an undeserved reputation for a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance rather than glory"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation," which began this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, Isabella I's ancient residence. English, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashionmaking", which represents more than 130 models of the top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his revered clients it could not be written.
Valentino has always felt enchanted by the precious and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is brimming with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social ascension: from a simple tailor from the city of Vogher in the north of Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian cream."
To love the royal family is not a bad thing.
"At least they don't tire your starling of a cigarette into a great carpet, like some gorgeous pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 60's and 70's we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his chat in Gstaad," explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always had elegance rather than glory.
He is still a star.”
Valeria Mazz performs Valentina
The Argentine model Valeria Mazzová does not forget the charisma of the designer.
"It's been a lot of years since we went to dinner with him after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every little thing of his apartment, decoration, food, music, everything was reflected and his spirit was smelled.
Everyone invited could feel important and loved thanks to him," recalls the top model, who began working with him during the Paris Peak Fashion Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Show of Nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly re-loving.
He loves people with good manners and better titles and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a distinctive seventy-meter-long passage that offers a role-changing: the visitor turns into a model and marches through a passage to observe the "occupancy" of dreams worn by Valentin's masterpieces as a dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, a costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Night," or a coat of wool and a coat of wool
The audience of the mannequins shines names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "can't be forgotten."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vest "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I give him priority over others for his femininity and great love for women because it underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, brighten up a lot and give a "spark" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first wore Valentina.
When she grew up and lived in Italy, she longed to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It was finally in the late 90’s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with ruffles, a clad-up bodice and a strapless top.
It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodriguo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because dresses are not just dresses, it's also a set of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Pavel the Greek in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" to create this silk dress with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a siding four and a half meters long.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents the landmark of the ultimate fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from a high society."
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-être," is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honors in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulate as much honor as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been attracted by his selection, calmness, groomed and perfect appearance," acknowledges Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at the Orsay Museum's gala dinner.
He was at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was impeccable, time left no mark on him.”
When the princess says so...
The hardest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano
For four euros, carriers in the Indonesian volcano are gambling with their lives and health as they endure 70 kilos of sulphur down steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anta Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living by conquering the sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day must rise to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and, when in contact with the air, pass to a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulphur that weigh up to 70 kilos together, it carries them on the shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which towers 2 386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for the exhausted carriers to climb upwards at a turtle pace, as they maintain balance and thoroughly deliberate their steps so that they do not slip and crash into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could cost them their lives, as happened to one French tourist who crashed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for each kilo of sulfur they mine
When they're up, they make their way around the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
It is the firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has benefited in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar bleaching.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," Anto explains to us, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
While this seems like a negligible amount for such an inhumane effort, it's three times what he would make in the field.
"The daily salary of the miners here is very high. For example, coffee is collected with 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the carrier, which previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, has trouble breathing, still coughs, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks living in a Kawah Ijen volcano three times a day, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, despite having a face protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated with toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than decent English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, afflicted by fate, could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, and instead does the work of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and wakes up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulfur at night continues to spring up and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto rages into the crater and illuminates his path with a small lamp, which he has attached to his helmet and bought it with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry on the shoulders of a basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, has not mechanized the sulphur extraction due to cost savings, nor does it provide carriers working on their own and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of the 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the surcharge for photography, which, along with a ticket for 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros), are collected by the nature park’s guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for cattle, and not for people," argues Madrusin, a sturdy 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left schools.
He manages to lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can work "as long as possible" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the dense vapors that come out of the volcano, the miners are so claiming that none of them complain that they suffer from serious illnesses... but it is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulphur in a volcano, which then take three trucks down a steep road between the thickets to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant misery of one of the world's heaviest crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the fact that they do not have children, careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. Let us do our civic duty and beget a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but still - or perhaps for that very reason - the video expanded mass-wide to YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These sentences are part of rap, which uses local allusions like "we put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency's artistic director, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill "their civic duty."
"This is exclusively an issue of the Internet, so it must have been funny and funny.
It's the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to touch on.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like spread perfumes with pheromons or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem.”
1.2 children
He who doesn't take it too lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend USD 1 300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representatives' conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value was 2, which is considered the recovery rate, in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Government's Department of Marriage and Family Affairs, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"People thus have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it's not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbearing. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While immigration policy efforts have been made to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as measures against population decline, this has caused displeasure among locals.
On some Singaporean websites, undisguised xenophobia is seen against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping salaries low and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party recorded its worst election result since independence began.
After the election, there was an effort to solve the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has begun regulating the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in the marketability.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support a bachelor's lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of developer EL Developers, claims their "shoeboxes" are selling far faster than larger homes.
"They are more popular, by selling for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger size.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow.'
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, the interview with Singaporeans working in a financial district in the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why a lot of people put it off," says a young official.
"Let the others have children.
But for me, it's important to rely on my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old, youngster.
Both men and women mention career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is the Singaporeans who have the final say about starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something that has a personal nature or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any violation."
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet matters that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely inherent" on a personal level and a "user name and password" when it came to social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my biggest secret," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," she argues.
"On FB I give nice photos or photos of us playing.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn't share a photo that wouldn't be mine, or a photo that would ridicule anyone," she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I opened a Twitter account so I could express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I'm just putting them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicating with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of fourteen-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits to the last network that he doesn't know 20 people from his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them directed him to anything, nor did he ask for an address or phone number.
"If they urged me or demanded it from me, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now called cyberbullying.
"They blackmailed a friend on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who he was," he confirms.
The victim, according to Jose, did not opt out of the account.
"She's just activated the private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps on how to secure the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if someone bothered me or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he argues.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that children and adolescents need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
It states that: "The Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic fellow Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Aborigines and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and we are still learning for ourselves.”
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also, to be - in terms of the surroundings - deliberate, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, asking questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone posted your photo the way you posted your friend's?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag people in the photos from the celebrations, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more: Do everyone constantly need to know what you're doing?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the same way in the Internet environment as outside it.
It's the same rules.
"One is guided by respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and it should be the same on social media," he argues.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-grade teacher and education counselor explains that it is essential for children's parents to read the rules of social networks carefully.
"If they understand every insidiousness, they have a good basis to talk to children about the consequences that setting up an account on the Internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers."
The summit of South America is over and the Lima statement has not been made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without issuing a statement from Lima, which was announced and which was reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access a document signed at the sixth meeting of Unasur's heads of state and government, but representatives of both the Foreign Ministry and the presidential office, who initially determined to publish the document after the summit, said it would be later published on the Peruvian government's website.
They further said the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists have had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message "confidential session, transmission of sound prevented."
A small amount of the information available to journalists was provided by the press secretaries of some governments who were present, but not by a Peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, prompting the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is just a statement from President Humala, and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and the originally promised Lima Declaration was not made public on this occasion, despite being zealously required by the press.
On the official ASPA website, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasts for all journalists, but to completely prevent the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the dispute over the border between the two countries.
Peru President Ollanta Humala and Chile's President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday by hearing the defense speech of both sides to discuss a dispute launched by Lima against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute the judgment that will resolve the dispute we are hearing in this international court today," President Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts," Piñera added, greeting President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that he would submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, thus expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia deemed the decision to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from the organization Unasur in 2011 after the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening morning speeches and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been accepted and that 31 projects had been planned between South American countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries would take "important steps towards a South American citizenship target for which residence agreements are being expanded."
He said actions were encouraged to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a victorious essence, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our peoples a better future.”
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links of various places of South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries more connected and create new economic ties," the Peruvian president said in a reading.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American Nations” from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In that sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before his participation in the regional meeting that he hopes to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to respect the International Court of Justice's ruling on the dispute over the maritime border, which is disputed by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega to lead the negotiations in the most civilized and thoughtful possible form," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peñi Nieta.
As part of the summit, the EU's defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and a consensus on defence of the field.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last mentioned country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of the regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case really, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told state-run TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War 2" and in other conflicts, "but now there are practically one homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which Unasur member countries support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean community, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
Among other things, the President of Ecuador has agreed to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and those who signed the San Jose Human Rights Pact will be taken into account.
"Those who are in the lead never commit to anything, and we South Americans, on the contrary, will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Interameric Human Rights Commission is funded in Washington by the United States," he said, referring to political asylum provided by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at the time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing trial."
In addition, he criticised the Swedish judiciary, who asked him to submit to questioning on Swedish territory over an alleged sexual offence, with "the Swedish legislation's own legislation allowing for interrogation by videoconference call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But there is a risk that his physical and mental state will deteriorate because he is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that talks with London were held to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We do not negotiate about human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant conversations.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings in various European instances.”
He stated that "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Mr Assange's Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without a problem, and as has already been done in other cases, this issue will be brought to an end tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, and made clear that he certainly did not tolerate "under-averageness, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the wicked and depraved politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy that neither such journalists, "neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor bourgeoisie, control Ecuador", and stated that if he was re-elected, "he would continue to change guided in the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also backed the decision to further maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership of the union Unasur at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupism wrapped in legality" because it has in fact "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, Ecuador's president said he considered it "completely" a wish by his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the aftermath of the International Court in The Hague ruling, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
The judgment is not accepted at the moment.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be judged wide to overcome and be able to move forward.”
He also expressed hope in settling the dispute over the maritime border, which is being resolved in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept the judgment, however harsh it may be."
In the wake of the possibility that he will run in Ecuador's next presidential election to run for a third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
"I have never been interested in power, but such unfair situations as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept that responsibility.”
"If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, the same thing awaits me.
I've already made up my mind," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatments for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
"I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says President Chavez has gone on planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It's not a relapse in the president's health," he explained.
The head of Ecuadorian state attended the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) today, which concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like lightning hit me," he recounts in his memory of the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "relieve a little" but apparently to no avail.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his own illness on his own shoulders and began to report on it. And that's with such a commitment that he's already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is without a doubt one of the most ancient HIV patients of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from the age of 22, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.
Even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are a lot of people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused destruction of the organism and has debilitated the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS has emerged in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "means great success that the life expectancy of a patient who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate way is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, adding that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that the researchers concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that survival and full-life depend on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, with better those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cells CD4 to 50 years.
Simply put, it means that whoever is diagnosed with HIV at 25 can, according to these findings, "in adherence to treatment to live without problems until the age of 75," the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the death rate has decreased significantly in recent years and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has fallen from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (UN/AIDS Joint Programme Yearbook), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and so far by May this year, 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
- Why do people continue to die from the disease?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have not exhausted our medical supplies. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the infection, i.e. in the late stage of the disease."
He adds a convincing figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infection already manifests. The only thing that needs to be done in order to be able to influence overall mortality more is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all those who ask for it."
In his proposal, he coincides with specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in the state of Jalisco, and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tests done in a private laboratory just because his friend did it, and despite his young age, AIDS has already broken out and also suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have a lot of fun three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication.”
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who has accepted the invitation to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today as part of World AIDS Day.
"Let them have the tests done. If they took a risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarizes the motto of the Battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a large gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajar journalist who finds out information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task "they have actually increased the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages even hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to the new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judging from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and medical staff that teens want to avoid, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Let the condoms not just be behind the counters, but let the hundred be found in dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"It's not a promiscuity boost.
Nor is it about "paying them beer and motel," as Governor Emilio González reacted to a question about whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his county.
There is no such sexuality. It is best to make condoms accessible to those who already lead the sex life," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13 435 cases (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This condition marks the fourth place in new and detected cases of AIDS in Mexico and 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of the infection occurs sexually, 6% bloodstream y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50 thousand people can live with HIV, because for one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognize the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt established by bankruptcy in Mexico, raises a detrimental precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
So it seems that the restructuring procedures of companies that allow Mexican law do not apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
Approval of the judgment issued 15. Last June, Judge Harlin Hal, in bankruptcy court for northern Texas, left Mexican firms in practice defenseless against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the el Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door to the U.S. Supreme Court of Mexico to the main glassmaker, appealing against three irregularities.
First of all, while a judge of this case argues that creditors are to be governed by the United States Insolvency Act, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the main procedure is determined by bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
Essentially, a model law of the United Nations was created for this purpose to unify international commercial law, which is designated by the Arbitrator by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without a vote of branches from the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro vs. branches is recognised, the required majority would not be achieved for the approval of the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws allow this possibility.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples of Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose internal debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro would stand trial in the United States, i.e. funds of "vultures" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach a majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm Gonzáleze Sady will appeal for a new assessment directly before the Court of Appeal to make the assessment with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because only three had originally voted.
If it fails here, it will require as an appeal a revision of the process by a higher instance, in this case by the U.S. Supreme Court.
What is serious about the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as a department of amicus curiae, in which the Vitro procedure under the Bankruptcy Act is detailed and in which it points out that the company has eased itself by inclining to the agreements signed by both countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules intended for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
A bump on both sides: punishment for both Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Unnoticed, a criminal complaint from the Mexican aviation union against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárrag Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, lay on the table for several months, and according to the pilots' union, the vessel had already overflowed.
An instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which he accuses of obstruction in achieving justice.
According to her, the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General’s Office on the transaction made by the entrepreneur, in which he selected 198 million pesos from IXE from the F/589 fideicomism on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were probably directed to buy the shares of the Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The siege of Dragon Mart
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association met at the weekend in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankun.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge commercial and distribution center with products from a "land with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which at the bottom would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies.
The organization Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has been able to unify the governors of the south-east zone in order to oppose the monumental area, which would partially devastate the protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of matter with ACTA
The request of the Senate, which the Government did not take into account and which demanded an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Anti-Country Agreement in Japan, known by the English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial) had ceased to be up to date.
As is well known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to freedom of expression on social media.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: " Basketball was my life"
Basketball world-beating Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was in charge of a wheelchair stroke in 2008, passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior category player, a BSN national basketball player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I've held a lot of roles in basketball over the course of my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, the general director of the national team and chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled during a visit to reporters at the Primera Hora newspaper at his home in Bayamón, where he has been living with Isabel for more than 50 years, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest move of all guards those that resemble his work in the draw Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"That was my best years, I enjoyed it the most because I had the opportunity with the team los Vaqueros since 1967 to participate in eight championships, whether as the owner, co-owner or coach.
It has been a number of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
That's when the team took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said in a statement.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was previously a coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, told me: "I have a two-foot player for you.
Do you want him?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon a championship win, Gausse would then contribute to the next one.”
He enjoyed the championship, when he played Gauss for the team of los Vaqueros, but only remotely, because in 1988 he was already the president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's placement in the national team.
“I remember the first time we beat the United States in a qualifying Olympic game in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have had the bronze had it not been for that Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw-in," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as is the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we ratted out the United States team, which was pretty similar to the one that blew our bronze at the World Championships.
That team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also there were youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have had a perfect composition but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was a team from the 1995 Olympic qualification in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players ruled out because of a skirmish in the Pan-American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Piculin.
Not to mention his tenure in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like Leo Arilla's work very much.
Which success do you consider the greatest in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN national league had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you not manage to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the guys from Ponce would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in compulsory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
That's what I'm pleased about.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, Larry Hagman was world-renowned for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted ruthlessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewinga in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 80's, he died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new Dallas series, died according to an official announcement by the family provided to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon for cancer-related complications.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he liked best," his family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in both the original and new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in a Dallas hospital," her agent, Jeffrey Lane, announced.
He brought joy to all he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
The Hagmans diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie, broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (the genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to his home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His appearances in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star-studded peak.
The dramatic CBS series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Jajar?", which was supposed to raise expectations about a work full of emotions, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only a huge array of speculations by viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in the sazing offices.
It also helped this episode to reach the record for ratings.
The November 1980 episode, in which the response was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most-watched entertainment show in history after the end of the 1983 MASH series, watched by 50 million viewers.
His sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) fired at J.R..
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy greed with a charismatic smile: a cunning businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be confined to rehab.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for the millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
The ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The filming of five episodes of the second row has already been completed and the sixth has just been filmed," the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would go.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the stage in New York, and then served in England with the Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The married couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and have lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published an autobiographical book, Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything there that I knew could hurt someone or harm him in any way," he told Prensa Asociada.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give courage, I meet them when they go into surgery and after that," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
A course begins that explores the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course this semester about the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which is scheduled to come on December 21, many people caught on as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call "the debt of Armageddon," and the growing conflict that Israel is drawn into, the place where, according to Christians theorizing about the end of the world, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester he's ever been," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey this week.
When you talk about what’s going on in the world today, like we have 30 days left, it’s a really good time.
And remember that bad means good for apocalyptic-minded people.
And this is not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Vacker is throwing a course "Means, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're discussing why these ideas expand with time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic topics and exploring how they are different from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what was possible, probable, believable and impossible," Vacker says.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history, and his colleague, Amara Solari, an assistant professor in the history of art and anthropology, came together to organize a course with the simple title The End of the World.
"We don't join "2012" because we always count on the possibility of holding the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "impending destruction", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "up to the evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He stretched within two hours," Restall said of his course for students with a high average of 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we were asked by e-mail whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular, or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour before that could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan predictions and we're refuting it in some way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that reaches back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions about the end of the world.
The Internet has caused this speculation to flourish.
"Elsewhere, people don't think about it," he said.
This is the case in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, when asked if he knew about a course about the "end of the world," he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not involved in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception to the highest office.
We have mercy from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last trial, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several have said they intend to go to the "end of the world" celebrations.
"I'll probably call a few friends to laugh together," explained twenty-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
