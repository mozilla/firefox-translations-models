Economia and Centrum connect management.
For example, they will offer joint advertising
Economia&#39;s new integrated newsroom in Prague&#39;s Karlín.
The Economia company took another step to transform the Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and Centrum have shared top management.
&quot;The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house,&quot; commented Kamil Čermák, vice-chairman of the board of directors of Economy and authorized general manager, on the changes made.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by the CEO of Centrum Holdings, Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the store, to whom Zuzana Tylčerová, the advertising director of both companies, reports.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editorial offices is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes the transformation director Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pittsová was entrusted with the newly established function of marketing director.
Věra Lhotská is the new head of the separate corporate communication department.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, human resources management for both publishers is managed by Petra Slabá.
&quot;Among other things, the new organizational structure will allow us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the creation of content for all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly further streamline the company&#39;s business management,&quot; added Čermák.
The company Economia, owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded an agreement to purchase Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz, and the SMB agency Najisto, as well as a portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
The company Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly magazines Respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Prague&#39;s Karlín.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was supposed to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
This was announced by CNN, citing an unnamed official of the US government.
The explosion at the alleged missile depot was widely reported in the Israeli press, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli army refused to comment on the airstrike when asked by CNN.
&quot;We do not comment on foreign media reports,&quot; she said.
According to a US government source, the targets of the Israeli airstrike were missiles and related equipment, which the Israelis believe could be transported to the Lebanese militant movement Hezbollah.
The AP agency, citing another American security official, reported that the target of the Israeli airstrike on a target on Syrian territory were Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly advanced Syrian air defense system.
However, according to the DPA agency, satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, a battery of SA-3 missiles was said to be visible on them, including a command center with a radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to an Israeli television report, the recorded missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will strike at any weapons shipment destined for Hezbollah or other designated terrorist groups.
Tony Blair has said he would jump at the chance to return as prime minister, but admitted a return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since June 2007, when he stepped down after ten years in the leadership role, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talking about British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, London&#39;s Evening Standard quoted him as saying: &quot;Yes, sure, but it&#39;s unlikely to happen, is it, so...&quot;
Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport due to shooting
Shots were fired at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Because of this, the police evacuated a part of the airport, allegedly it was terminal three.
The Reuters agency, citing California media, claims that law enforcement officers shot an armed man with a rifle.
Citing police, the Los Angeles Times reported that there was a shootout in which two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration were injured.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any victims is still not clear.
Firefighters are talking about an incident with more injuries.
Berdych and Štěpánek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players, Jaroslav Navrátil, nominated a quartet of Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives are defending the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent&#39;s field in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15 to 17.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in the last five years.
&quot;We know that we are going to a hot ground, that it will be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always.
&quot;We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best,&quot; said Štěpánek, the architect of the winning point in last year&#39;s final with Spain.
The Brno observatory will take visitors into space in the new digitarium
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the large planetarium has changed over the past six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sink into new comfortable seats, and above their heads a 17-meter-diameter projection surface in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz has been added.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
&quot;There are twenty-one computers that generate an image,&quot; said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
&quot;The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classic personal computers,&quot; noted observatory technician Tomáš Hladík.
Digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The audience will thus find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to show purchased programs as well as their own creations in the hall.
There are two shows on the program from Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly into space, take a spin in a centrifuge, and then see with illustrative examples how demanding conditions astronauts face in space.
The second program is for children and is called Magic Cliff - Kaluoka&#39;hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost approximately fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
&quot;The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers,&quot; explained Dušek.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to director Dušek, 25,000 to 30,000 visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
Supreme Court upholds Obama&#39;s health care law
The US Supreme Court has ruled that Barack Obama&#39;s signature health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&#39;s individual regulation -- which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a fine -- is unconstitutional based on the government&#39;s taxing authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court&#39;s four more liberal members, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented.
The court also upheld the remainder of the 2,700-page bill, further ruling that the health care law&#39;s requirement, which mandates states to expand access to health insurance or face the loss of all federal funding for health insurance, is uncoercive and unconstitutional.
A lawsuit was filed to block the law by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
During the 2012 primaries, Law strongly opposed each of the major Republican candidates, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.
Naďa Konvalinková in the role of the innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a barmaid and she was very successful.
Perhaps the popular Czech actress was planning to change her profession and start a business in a pub?
Naďa Konvalinková appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and poured beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and it worked for me right away.
My boss even offered to hire me and I could make a living by brewing beer.
But I refused, I&#39;d rather stay with what I do to this day, with acting,&quot; revealed Konvalinková with a smile, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the operation of the Irish pub.
&quot;I like Irish beer and I&#39;ll drink Irish whiskey every now and then,&quot; the actress revealed her tastes.
Nadi&#39;s longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I am after death and in this new life I must not drink.
I&#39;m allowed one beer or one shot a day, and I try to follow that,&quot; added the actor.
Egypt inaugurates first freely elected president
Muhammad Morsi has been sworn in, but his triumphant day is unlikely to end Egypt&#39;s political unrest.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he was inaugurated as the country&#39;s first freely elected president since Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and Egypt&#39;s fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 black-robed judges in a mansion built overlooking the Nile that resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
&quot;We strive for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said in a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
&quot;Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by individual governments.
When Morsi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pageantry of the Mubarak era, traffic was only stopped briefly to allow the motorcade to pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, mockingly described as the uncharismatic &quot;spare tire&quot; of the Muslim Brotherhood, has soared since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as the candidate of Islamists, but also of all those who want to see an end to the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak .
&quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to deliver an inaugural address.
While standing at attention, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Husayn Tantáví, was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chants of &quot;the army and the people are one hand&quot; from hundreds of people gathered in the university&#39;s main lecture hall.
Cairo University was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a stronghold of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak&#39;s authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly vowed to retake the presidential powers stripped from his office by a military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath in court, rather than parliament as is customary, he bowed to the will of the military, suggesting the power struggle will continue.
Morsi&#39;s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a city should go to the cemetery.
A visit to it will reveal more than a walk through the busy center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than Bedekr would reveal.
Many people &quot;read from the grave&quot;.
They slowly wander the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what their nationalities are, what their beliefs are, how big and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How do they express their social status, what are their tastes.
And from the condition of the graves, they also find out how the survivors take care of their dead.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I have become a hoarder.
I haven&#39;t seen candy in my apartment for two years, and this year probably won&#39;t be any different.
However, statistics show that I am the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year – 158 million of them, in fact – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween are the trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are the latest fashion fad.
Sexy doesn&#39;t just have to be women anymore; foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots can be sexy too.
As for the men, I expect we&#39;ll see a lot of zombies thanks to the parade of the dead, and I bet Daft Punk&#39;s spacemen will make it to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there&#39;s nothing wrong with going with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.
So you will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we waste no time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That&#39;s roughly 300 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers, and Clark bars.
That&#39;s amazing news for the 41 million carolers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhoods.
In fact, we buy, and believe it or not, 45 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
The one thing we don&#39;t want is candy corn, and yet, according to the National Candy Stores Association, nearly 16,000 tons of them are sold around Halloween.
That&#39;s about 9 billion individual candy corns.
That&#39;s a mystery I&#39;ve never solved.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like &quot;Terror behind the walls&quot;, &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The house of shock&quot;.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that, according to the American Haunted Houses Society, generate $500 million in revenue, and that includes those awesome pictures of you peed on by the scares that your friend posts on Facebook and you can&#39;t delete them and the person you like will view the photo and add a comment like &quot;you look nice&quot;.
And finally, a little about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were little, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - we&#39;ve been doing it since we were little.
Luckily for us, the pumpkin baby trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving a pumpkin instead of sitting in one.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably came from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins were grown this year.
If you&#39;re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon of Napa, California, and try carving their nearly one-ton pumpkin.
How insects from Thailand boosted the sales of a Paris bar
Maybe you sneer at insects and at the same time have no idea that you eat about half a kilogram of them a year completely voluntarily.
For example ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you are also provided with a unique experience.
Elie Daviron, chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar, was the first to include insects on the menu of his establishment in Paris at the beginning of October.
A bar whose name was inspired by William Burroughs&#39; book The Naked Lunch, you&#39;d find it in the trendy 18th arrondissement near tourist-heavy Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now bite not only various larvae, grasshoppers or water bugs, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (so that the insects do not damage their wings, bend their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to the Davirons all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons for consuming insects.
The first of them is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
&quot;In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids,&quot; Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, what makes a good restaurant is pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
&quot;I&#39;m not saving the world, I&#39;m just mediating a new experience,&quot; he explained.
Not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of eating a bug decorated with pesto, but according to the owner, the reactions of the customers of the Parisian bar to the insects served are very positive.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and eventually choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands ALSO CHANGES YOUR MOOD.
98 people, divided into three groups, took part in the experiment.
The first two had the task of solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after failure appeared to be much more optimistic than the group that didn&#39;t wash their hands.
The group &quot;with washed hands&quot; also performed better than the other group in the next test.
Nevertheless, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash them.
The results of the &quot;washed&quot; were at the level of the third group, whose participants had not experienced any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical cleanliness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, motivation decreases, test takers have to concentrate much more in the next exams.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from WC.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs do not wash their hands, but after traveling by public transport, it is already a fifth.
They also stick to hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Petting a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks as to how necessary it is to wash hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks would wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands roughly ten times a day.
&quot;Although it would be appropriate, I am afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better,&quot; commented dermatologist Klaudie Komárková on the results of the survey.
A US-Mexico drug-smuggling tunnel with its own railroad has been found
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
US authorities have described the roughly one meter by one meter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds for the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is full of nondescript warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be smuggled through it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
The three men, who authorities say worked as drivers, were charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine.
If convicted, he faces prison terms ranging from 10 years to life in prison.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a challenge for drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 2,000-foot-long corridor equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Is Europe&#39;s elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses together and define what changes to the relationship with the EU British businesses and job-creating companies want to see.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, asking leading UK business people their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and across sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe&#39;s arcane institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulation to product laws – most business people expressed the view that control of these key powers should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business people said the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European trading area – with even 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreeing.
And finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling finding: a clear majority want Britain to seek a treaty change and relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which were agreed by businesses of all sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for &quot;meaningful change&quot; that will bring influence back to Britain.
The stakes are high – achieving a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% in the referendum vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this poll shows British business backs his plan to amend the terms of Britain&#39;s EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to represent a significant shift away from the current balance of power back towards Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be the priority, and as our survey results show, for business this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels&#39; regulatory approach.
Pamela Anderson had her iconic blonde curls &quot;plucked out&quot; and put on a new, dramatically shaggy cut.
Pamela&#39;s blonde hair is famous for her role in the sexy TV show Coast Guard.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock her fans with a new hairstyle.
The ex-Coast Watch cat ditched her long blonde hair and sported a platinum rascal haircut.
The 46-year-old actress revealed her latest look change as she stepped out in LA on Wednesday, posting a photo on her Twitter page.
It&#39;s the first time in 20 years that the blonde beauty has worn her hair short, and we&#39;re loving the low-key change.
What do you think of Pammy&#39;s hair?

The UK Government has announced a study which aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2&#39;s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin once the first phase starts in 2026.
Transport Secretary Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot;bring Britain together&quot;.
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was &quot;thrilled&quot; to be working with the UK government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase Two is complete, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
HS2 has been commissioned by the UK government, in talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, to explore additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that better connects the UK and its cities.&quot;
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without it, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it&#39;s also about connectivity – 18 cities across Great Britain will be better connected thanks to HS2, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today&#39;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; support Scotland&#39;s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: &quot;The high-speed line has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds to Scotland&#39;s economic weight in the overall case for high-speed rail across Britain.&quot;
So we are excited to be working with the UK Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to benefit everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report of this study with UK ministers over the next year and deciding together the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge for carry-on bags
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 per carry-on bag and $2 per coffee or soda, though it said in its announcement Wednesday that passengers will be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance and $100 if passengers wait until arriving at the gate to pay.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&#39;Malley said the $100 fee is intended to encourage passengers to pay in advance.
&quot;We would hate to collect that fee,&quot; she said.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees by cramming as much as they could into carry-on bags hidden in the storage area, so there was often a lack of space in this area.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to bring less stuff on board.
O&#39;Malley said the new fee isn&#39;t really about raising more money.
The thing is, Frontier&#39;s most loyal customers have made it abundantly clear that finding space in the overhead storage is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company&#39;s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in line at Frontier&#39;s gate can bring a bag for which they pay nothing, while another passenger in line pays $100 for the same bag.
O&#39;Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure passengers are aware of the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier&#39;s new carry-on fee won&#39;t go into effect until the summer, but a date has yet to be set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money and passengers who request the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are struggling to raise enough cash to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
But the majority did not touch the hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for carry-on bags three years ago, and fellow low-cost carrier Allegiant Air later followed suit.
Hungary&#39;s Wizz Air is the only company that also has such charges, says aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated Spirit&#39;s carry-on fee would generate $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when passengers were met with Spirit&#39;s unusual carry-on fee.
&quot;Boarding the plane was the smoothest I&#39;ve ever seen in my aviation career,&quot; he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and arguments at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, &quot;and boarding was a snap.&quot;
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit&#39;s lead.
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the entire can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but backed off seven months later after complaints from passengers, and no other major airline has followed suit.
Frontier&#39;s latest move to charge a carry-on bag unless passengers purchase a flight directly from the airline is its latest effort to drive customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all the airlines an incentive to drive passengers to buy directly from them instead of through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency just half their loyalty program miles.
On Wednesday, it cut the rewards for miles flown to 25 percent of the miles of a given trip.
So a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased through an online travel agency earns a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to select their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through Frontier&#39;s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and it&#39;s losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results reported Wednesday by corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings
Republic is trying to solve Frontier&#39;s financial problems by selling this airline.
We studied 11 THOUSAND ADS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November of last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 advertisements offering a job, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 advertisements (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is therefore becoming the most important medium for posting job offers.
Back in 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it stabilized at around 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertisement of job opportunities largely reflects the current situation on the labor market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in a time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same monitored period, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
In contrast, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider spectrum of professions, including blue-collar ones, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The degree of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
Advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts took the leading places on the Internet.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses appeared only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs mainly to service and blue-collar professions.
Of course, education is among the most frequently stated requirements that employers express through advertising offers.
Other monitored areas included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was stated in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of advertisements, employers required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for &#39;computer literacy&#39; appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the field was required in 54 percent of the advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
The blue-collar professions are mainly mechanics and repairmen or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairmen of electrical devices, added the author of the study, Jiří Tillner.
Employers also state requirements for the qualities and skills of potential applicants in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently requested skills, communication skills have been appearing in first place in advertising for a long time.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centers are struggling with low attendance
This follows from data from real estate consulting companies Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
Kraków Shopping Center opens to the public in Prague&#39;s Bohnice, it will be the 19th shopping center in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center in relation to the location and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead spots in the centers,&quot; said Michal Soták from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle head of retail real estate Sylvia Samadi, about a fifth of malls are experiencing low footfall.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in a given location.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centers must try harder to &#39;lure&#39; their customers to new market brands, entertainment, services and marketing events,&quot; added Samadi.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, even rising in some centers, because landlords were willing to discount rents and sublease some units during the crisis.
&quot;However, it is true that some projects have opened recently that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda &amp; Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc),&quot; added Soták.
According to Sylvia Samadi, shopping centers opened in the last two years are gaining ground very slowly.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called &#39;convenience centers&#39;, focused on shopping and services of daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity,&quot; said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also room for additional shopping centers on the domestic market.
Both for small &#39;service&#39; centers and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansions in regional cities.
&quot;Cities like Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth,&quot; added Soták.
In Prague, he sees space for the upcoming shopping center on Vítězné náměstí, and Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square have clear potential.
&quot;The expansion of retail parks is being intensively developed, which enable traders to cover and expand into smaller and smaller cities at favorable rent and operating costs, there is also space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores , which benefit from a good location,&quot; added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags behind by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Parents of minor Georgia boy who died in freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor Georgia boy whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school&#39;s gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family&#39;s attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Ga., was found slumped over in the bleachers at his high school gym on Jan. 11.
Lowndes County sheriff&#39;s investigators have ruled Johnson&#39;s death an accident, but the 17-year-old&#39;s family denies that.
&quot;They clearly believe their son was murdered,&quot; attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff claimed.
&quot;They believe it defies logic, the laws of physics, and it defies common sense,&quot; Crump said.
They believe this is to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son&#39;s death.
&quot;As usual they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag,&quot; he said.
State&#39;s Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting a routine investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
&quot;I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for a routine investigation,&quot; he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died of &quot;positional asphyxiation.&quot;
However, a second autopsy gave a different cause of death, according to Moore.
&quot;There are some question marks that need to be answered or confirmed,&quot; he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in Johnson&#39;s death to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation warrant, he will ask the FBI and execute it.
A deputy with the Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Office was not immediately available for comment Thursday.
A south Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager&#39;s parents hope the footage will hold a clue to how their son died.
Report: Obama campaign considered swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama&#39;s closest adviser secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ballot, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the highlight of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann&#39;s eagerly awaited book on the 2012 campaign, &quot;Double down: Game Change 2012.&quot;
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president&#39;s top aides held intensive focus group meetings and polls in late 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama&#39;s fading reelection hopes.
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and at the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the election effect of moving former Secretary of State Clinton to the post vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a handful of the president&#39;s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former top White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was being considered.
The book, &quot;Double down,&quot; claims that Daley spearheaded efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they ultimately decided not to make the move when data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would &quot;not substantially increase Obama&#39;s chances &quot;.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
&quot;I&#39;ve been researching a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley told the paper.
You mustn&#39;t forget that at the time the president had a terrible outlook, so we were like, &quot;Christ, what are we going to do?&quot;
While Daley characterized the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment to see if the move would pay off in the election.
&quot;Campaigns don&#39;t put that kind of money into elections and qualitative research unless something is really being seriously considered,&quot; Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team was considering this trade.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential shuffling.
While Daley said he didn&#39;t think the president &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted it was &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book &quot;Double down&quot; does not definitively answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama&#39;s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn&#39;t know about the research into dropping Biden.
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Martin replied.
Not so, Mr. Haska.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
Such pressure must be exerted so that Martin Hašek is deprived of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will lower the level of political culture, which is already meagre.
Martin Hašek protects himself by the promise he made, but everyone, and politicians in particular, must be aware of the consequences of a given promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn&#39;t apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr. Haška, if you mean well for this country (and your frequent statements confirm this to me, if you haven&#39;t lied - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as a statement of a man who made a mistake and takes responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be a proud, albeit flawed person, or a life-long skeet.
You may think it is unfair that I address only you, but you are the leader and they are just lost sheep.
And you are a leader and always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to lower your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit out the shame and then attack again, but that&#39;s how partisans or renegades behave.
You are, I repeat, in your own eyes the leader, the alpha male, so act like it.
Accept responsibility and get out of politics.
Black box in your car?
As America&#39;s road planners scramble to find money to fix the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits easily on your car&#39;s dashboard.
The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and relay that information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning officials to overhaul America&#39;s antiquated highway funding system.
The usually dull design of highways suddenly stimulated an intense debate and the formation of various associations.
Libertarians got together with environmental groups and lobbied for the government to use these little boxes that would record the miles you drive and maybe even where you drive—and then use that information to compile a tax assessment.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has cited a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress can&#39;t agree on whether to proceed, some states are waiting for nothing.
They are looking at how they can move to a system where drivers pay per kilometer of road they drive over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
&quot;It&#39;s not an issue where we have a lot of choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of State Governments, which plans for the state to begin tracking the mileage of every California motorist by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The stimulus is the fact that the Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes Americans pay at gas stations, is at rock bottom.
Americans aren&#39;t buying as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars get a lot more mileage per gallon.
The federal tax alone, at 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by even a single penny.
&quot;A gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently put tracking devices in 500 cars to test this pay-per-mile system.
&quot;In the long run, it seems like the most logical alternative,&quot; he said.
Experts call it a mileage user fee.
It&#39;s no surprise that urban liberals like the idea, as taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planners look to this system as they plan strategies to meet the goals set forth in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (D-Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most workable long-term alternative.
Free-market advocates at the Reason Foundation also favor the idea of drivers paying for miles driven.
&quot;It&#39;s not a tax that&#39;s going to disappear into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US Secretary of Transportation, who in 2011 encouraged Congress to move in the direction of paying per kilometer.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would include about 10,000 cars.
But the House of Representatives leadership rejected the proposal, doing so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve traveling many miles to work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The most zealous is Oregon, which has included 5,000 drivers in the nation&#39;s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a mileage tax, instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York is currently exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do this on a limited basis for trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state departments of transportation, along with coastal states to the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement the change.
However, this concept does not only have supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
&quot;Concerns about Big Brother surveillance and things like that have been a big issue,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn&#39;t something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.&quot;
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure that inevitably expands to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among several states trying to find affordable technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car drives, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
It wanted to break into the emerging liability insurance market, where drivers would pay based on how far they drove.
But the device he&#39;s testing is attracting the attention of road network planners because it doesn&#39;t use GPS and only delivers a limited amount of information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
&quot;People will be more willing to go if you&#39;re not tracking their speed and their location,&quot; says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major flaws have emerged in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don&#39;t have to take any device and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all state residents.
Elsewhere, the hope is that a wary public will embrace the concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a tolling device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide mileage-based insurance and collect data on the speed of other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams .
&quot;Motorists will be willing to participate because of the value of the benefits offered to them,&quot; the city&#39;s project document states.
However, some transportation planners would like to know if all the discussion about paying per kilometer is just a giant proxy problem.
Officials with the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could fix the problem with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund very easily by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid or other fuel-efficient cars so they pay a fair share.
&quot;There&#39;s no need for radical surgery when an aspirin is plenty,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the operator O2.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, the deal is already in hand.
The announcement of the transaction should come in November, probably before the beginning of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner&#39;s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications, it started auctioning frequencies for LTE networks.
And to everyone&#39;s surprise, until then there was no talk of the company&#39;s desire to break into telecommunications.
But Sazka is now led by Robert Chvátal, a very experienced telecommunications expert.
He started as the marketing head of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), then became the director of Slovakian T-Mobile and most recently headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now admitted that she wants to start a virtual one with Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to transfer already existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like this under normal circumstances, but according to information from Hospodářské noviny, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone therefore needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer it can bid for specially designated spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to enter the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning off only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will let Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at a frequency of 900 MHz), which will enable the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the saved money on a fixed internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
By buying the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is a daughter of the Czech Republic), the latter would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big juggernaut that will be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would acquire the LTE networks already for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share networks.
Thus, the auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high sums that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic would be able to choose between calls with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia were transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September for protesting planned Arctic oil drilling have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by the AFP agency today with reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, she claims that the original accusation of her activists for piracy has not yet been withdrawn.
&quot;Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia following nonviolent action against an Arctic oil platform have been transferred from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg,&quot; the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA agency, it was a planned move.
The authorities first accused the ecologists of piracy, for which they could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace this charge with the lesser charge of disorderly conduct, which carries a lower penalty with a maximum of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace warned in today&#39;s statement that the authorities have not yet dropped the piracy charges as promised.
This is said to mean that the detainees are now charged with two offences.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace the piracy charge with a disorderly conduct charge.
But when the 30 prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not dropped.
Instead, new charges were brought against each,&quot; AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries near the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they filed an appeal, but the court rejected all of them.
Environmentalists complain about prison conditions.
According to AFP, Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg will facilitate meetings between detainees and their families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
&quot;In fact, they could be worse,&quot; he pointed out.
Faiza Oulahsen, one of the detained activists, asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published by Algemeen Dagblad today, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster against a police investigation has been jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to pass information to underworld kingpin Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would come to light.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top barrister who tipped off a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light has been jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was accused of passing sensitive information to underworld boss Neil Scarbrough about an investigation into his drug-trafficking activities after becoming suspected of using cocaine.
The barrister, nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; (party) and hailed by criminals as a top lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
Officers saw Sarborough, 32, leave three bags of cocaine at the lawyer&#39;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, where he was having dinner with colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
Over a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he sought to extort information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were wanted at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
A further 32 people have been jailed with them after police seized heroin and cocaine worth around £1.5m, along with £200,000 in cash, during a series of raids.
Ditta (42) gave information to criminals for fear that his addiction to cocaine would be discovered.
Today, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, had an embarrassing moment at Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer&#39;s downfall came after a police investigation into Scarborough revealed he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditto&#39;s home, and saw him place the 60 percent pure drugs under the lawyer&#39;s basket wearing a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was in regular telephone conversation with Ditta, who was having dinner at Blackburn Rovers&#39; Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned to the home where he found the drugs, and nine interviews took place between the two individuals.
The court heard that traces of the Class A drug were found in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards and that Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was &quot;confidential communication&quot;.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but all were seized and his hair samples were taken.
During police questioning, he said that he operated an office at both his home address and his workplace, and that clients also visited him at home on business matters.
But the court heard that after the key arrests he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;Who else is more aware of not breaking the law than a criminal lawyer.&quot;
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a legal representative and of getting too close to a particular client.
The relationship we&#39;re talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were no doubt legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He thwarted the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring his profession a good reputation, on the contrary, he brought it into disrepute.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be eroded.
Ditta denied the wrongdoing, stating: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to give information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn&#39;t wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.&quot;
However, after the hearing, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: &quot;Mr Ditta went from being a criminal solicitor to becoming a criminal himself when he started sourcing drugs from organized crime.&quot;
His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the designs of leading organized crime figures tasked with gathering valuable information for police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest standards of integrity and inspire the public to trust and feel that they can be relied upon.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit led an investigation into Mr Ditt, which also saw him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now of obstructing justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the trade were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta conducted an online interview about himself in which he said his dream job would be to legally represent clients on America&#39;s death row, he would like Mohammed Ali as a dinner guest, and he cited inequality as a motivation for the work.
Obama Backs Off on Health Care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated and ambitious promise that &quot;if you like your health care program, you can keep it.&quot;
Citing hundreds of thousands of provider termination notices, Republicans have accused the president of lying to the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama backed away from his original promise.
&quot;The vast majority of people who have health insurance that works can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called a &quot;media uproar&quot; about the terminations, Obama urged Americans who received the notices to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even less than expected.
&quot;You&#39;ll get a better deal,&quot; he said.
His administration says it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise that the 5 percent of the population who bought insurance on their own may be forced to switch programs because their insurance doesn&#39;t meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
&quot;I&#39;m telling these Americans straight up: you deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone &quot;miserably&quot; since October.
&quot;I&#39;m disappointed and angry like everyone else,&quot; she said.
I will try to earn back your trust.
An exasperated Sebelius uttered the line, caught on microphone, toward an aide sitting behind her at yesterday&#39;s Committee hearing, which came after a heated exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Missouri, over whether she herself must join the Obama care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing, he repeatedly pressed Sebelius about why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance and buy the program through HealthCare.gov that he is now forcing on millions of Americans.

Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he was only treated for a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, forming a hematoma there that troubled him throughout his life.
&quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; says Georges Bwelle.
We would have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals where he received whatever treatment was simply available.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy,&quot; says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be the first there, but you are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle&#39;s father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 residents.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle.
S because of poverty they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 surgeries for free last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped almost 32,000 people with his group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others pile into vans, attach medical supplies to the roofs, and travel over rugged terrain to villages in need.
They are not always lucky.
More than once the vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they receive a true hero&#39;s welcome: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best lodging the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle – with his big smile and unbridled energy – is more than willing to join in the local merriment.
The next day, the team begins treating hundreds of patients.
&quot;We have 500 patients on each expedition,&quot; says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document required by the school but which many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually done in the school building, the town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery area to make room for the next patient.
With the help of light from a generator, an operating room and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It&#39;s exhausting, but the village musicians usually keep the team motivated.
&quot;They play drums all night long to keep us awake and keep working,&quot; says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
The group – made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 surgeries for free last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to local residents.
One man said he would be able to work again after hernia surgery.
&quot;This will change the future of our family,&quot; the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second job funds about 60% of his non-profit activities; private contributions cover the rest.
&quot;I&#39;m not sure when he actually sleeps,&quot; says Katie O&#39;Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers for Bwelle&#39;s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O&#39;Malley, who come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it&#39;s great practice they wouldn&#39;t get at home.
&quot;We washed Dr. Bwelle&#39;s hands thoroughly and removed blood stains or held instruments for him,&quot; says O&#39;Malley.
You never get to experience that as a second year medical student in America.
Student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transport and studies.
&quot;He&#39;s a hero without a doubt,&quot; says O&#39;Malley.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant sleigh is not a burden.
Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy doing this job,&quot; says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope they see what I&#39;m doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain - that&#39;s why I do it.

Central banks will maintain swap lines in perpetuity
Temporary and bilateral arrangements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks said this in their joint statement.
&quot;It&#39;s a very sensible move,&quot; commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at London-based Barclays.
&quot;So far, all temporary instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is no surprise in my opinion,&quot; adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began to emerge in 2007 when the international credit market first faltered.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers&#39; decision comes as the US Fed prepares to end its stimulus program for the US economy, which could drive the price of money even higher on the global market.
A swap contract is normally used to overcome a lack of liquidity in one currency with a simultaneous excess of liquidity in the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
The number of people infected with the HIV virus has exceeded one thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people grows every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121, and in 2010 there were already 180.
Last year, 212 were infected, a record number.
&quot;In my opinion, there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year,&quot; said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led Prague&#39;s House of Light for Patients.
According to him, 165 HIV patients increased in the country from January to September last year, while this year there were 176 during the same period.
From the beginning of monitoring to the end of this September, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1,005 in September.
206 infected persons resided in the Central Bohemian Region.
156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region and 116 from the Ústecký Region heard the diagnosis.
The fewest infected come from Vysočina, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people were infected in the past during a blood transfusion.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus, transmitted to them from their mothers.
Children should learn myths and legends as &quot;models for a way of life,&quot; says the author.
The stories of Thor can show that &quot;brute force is no match for cunning,&quot; while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myth would be &quot;too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught in school,&quot; said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of age-appropriate works.
&quot;I think it&#39;s great that myths and folklore are already part of education,&quot; he said.
I have defended this plan for twenty years.
He added that &quot;openly instructive&quot; authors and teachers are a &quot;switch&quot; for engaging stories with a &quot;subliminal&quot; message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also writes Norse Myths (Penguin Book) and British National Tales, says: &quot;You can have good intentions, but you do better if you keep them to yourself.&quot;
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or have a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through story, not overtly stated.
The old truism that it is better to show than to describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not used to.
At first, she put away her smile, the one she always displayed as a defense against her friendly surroundings.
This was a great relief to her as it was a mask she had decided not to put on in public.
He was honest at home only on days when she was a grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Adík around.
And of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered all too well the lesson from endless business skills courses.
Now they finally fit really well.
So that she does not make her loved ones sad.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a disguise for a masquerade.
November, not even any other month, can do the miracle to make her smile for real, like when they were on a trip with the one who hasn&#39;t been here for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier&#39;s style evolve like a living language
My task is to preserve tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, Pierre Rainero, style director at Cartier, explains his position in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
GM is recalling some new light trucks in the U.S. to fix seatbacks
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a manual reclining seatback defect, according to an announcement Friday from the U.S. Auto Safety Authority.
In some of these vehicles, the front seat reclining mechanism may be defective.
As a result, the seatbacks do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#39;s (NHTSA) website says that &quot;if the car is hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, increasing the risk of injury.&quot;
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the van in June, and it&#39;s the major U.S. automaker&#39;s biggest vehicle launch since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.
GM informed the owner of the van about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the notice to owners because of the 16-day government shutdown that dampened auto sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra vans, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its inventory.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Overly inquisitive newspapers are to be investigated
A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page call for the release of a reporter accused of defamation will be thoroughly investigated, a press administrator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about the partly state-owned company.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now carry out a &quot;full remedy&quot;.
The &quot;correction&quot; order came from the State Administration for Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports about the said company Zoomlion.
&quot;The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disorganized,&quot; the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide &quot;to impose the administrative penalty of revoking Chen Yongzhou&#39;s journalistic license&quot;.
He also &quot;ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a comprehensive rectification of New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of New Express&quot;.
Mr. Chen has written several articles for New Express that have covered financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page requests for his release, claiming to stand by his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had been paid to publish false stories.
&quot;In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion as well as to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust,&quot; he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I did wrong.
Following Mr Chen&#39;s apology, the New Express newspaper issued a front-page apology saying it had failed to adequately check its reporting.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have made confessions on television.
Confessions are still regularly coerced, experts say, despite a law change this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
As the middle class impoverishes, Singapore&#39;s pawnshops are booming
At a pawnshop in Singapore&#39;s Bendemeer Mall, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter&#39;s school fees.
&quot;My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it,&quot; says Ms Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 (SGD 3,000) as an administrator every month and her husband also works, the family&#39;s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across regions in Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - is such that ValueMax, where the woman is carrying out her transaction, became the third-ranked pawnbroker on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelery pawning is not only a quick way to borrow cash – SGD 1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga&#39;s case – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawn shops in Singapore normally charge an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And so, as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit supported by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with their worsening financial situation.
This week, rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s cited rising household credit use, largely due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia as a percentage of gross domestic product.
Malaysia tops the list at 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which just barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
&quot;The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,&quot; said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia&#39;s CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have seen people rush to mortgage their personal assets and seize the opportunity to cash in their family jewels.
About 70 percent of the items pawned in the city&#39;s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we will stop grandma&#39;s gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand&#39;s largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen up to a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawn shops in recent months.
Growth in the mortgage industry is so great that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer Center branch and 15 like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also beyond Asia, says ValueMax chief executive Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund it using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says the mortgage not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn&#39;t directly increase debt.
&quot;Customers are pawning items they already own, and cashing in on personal property doesn&#39;t add to household debt,&quot; he says.
In society, asset pledge is increasingly accepted as a means of providing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops are not only people in financial distress.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches when they drop in gold bars or Rolex watches and can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come from all possible backgrounds.
&quot;These include wealthy individuals who need short-term borrowing for their bold deals or investments, or small businesses who need help solving their cash flow problems,&quot; says Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
NSA blames &#39;internal error&#39; for website crash, not hackers
The secretive National Security Agency said last Friday that its website went down for several hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacker attack as some claimed online.
&quot;The NSA.gov site was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a routine update,&quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be fixed during this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors recorded that the NSA website was down for at least six hours, and the site remains inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency&#39;s internal sensitive networks were not compromised &quot;at all.&quot;
A spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet has claimed responsibility for taking down the NSA site through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until the servers become overloaded and the site crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret agency NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has become the focus of public attention and scathing criticism in recent months following a string of revelations about foreign and domestic surveillance programs, largely the product of the theft of classified NSA files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency fueled earlier speculation that today&#39;s crash was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded one thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with the HIV virus.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 to the end of this year&#39;s third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1,005 people from the metropolis.
This follows from the statistics of the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the State Institute of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infected in the whole of the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease of immune failure has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new infections, and in 2010, 180.
The year before, the number dropped to 153, but last year, on the contrary, was a record.
According to the laboratory, there were 212 of them.
&quot;There is no doubt in my mind that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year,&quot; says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who for years led the Prague House of Light for Patients.
From October to the end of the year in 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavatý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three female patients.
From the start of monitoring to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS disease broke out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected people were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that at key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form that she could fulfill her duties as a statesman.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to the end of his presidential term and the events around Munich would have played out a little differently.
We probably wouldn&#39;t win the war, but after a symbolic resistance, the air force could fly over the border, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately and not fight hard for its legitimacy there.
And above all, the nation would not have a hangover from that capitulation to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and he was still in good shape during Munich, but things started to go downhill for him during the war and he behaved accordingly in February 1948.
Had he been a little better off, he could have gone into exile a third time and undermined the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It&#39;s a shame to talk about Hách.
They elected him with the idea that &quot;Mr. President will not be in a position to make decisions&quot;.
But he had to, even though it was probably not a big decision with a knife at Hitler&#39;s throat in the chancellery.
The head of intelligence, František Moravec, was saying until the last days of March 1939 what should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, did not go so smoothly and with such profit for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, they both did not trust him and were afraid.
A human wreck, Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow ordered him to do.
Ludvík Svoboda definitively disabled himself by participating in normalization and they had to depose him, already completely senile.
The fact that Husák was a helpless and sick depressed old man made the events in November 1989 easier, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky that the last years did not meet him in office, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh retired tennis player, but many of his actions suggest that his thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, now here we have this.
The head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like what he looks like and we don&#39;t know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the republic now.
Or maybe it&#39;s threatening, it&#39;s just not as visible.
Then there is the question of whether it is exceptionally good (from a historical point of view) that the president is not completely in power.
But it is not a normal state.
Couldn&#39;t we once again elect someone reasonably sane and reasonably sane as president in this country?

Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
The chairman of TOP 09, Karel Schwarzenberg, expects another early election soon.
A week after the last ones, in an interview for Aktuálně.cz, he said that there is no other way out and that any government emerging from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible conglomerate.
&quot;It can&#39;t last long,&quot; said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the lifespan of the new election period to be up to two years.
Arguing that voters are unlikely to choose completely differently next time, he disagrees: &quot;I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making.&quot;
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters in the next elections like this year (compared to 2010, it lost roughly 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there will be early elections, it would strengthen Andrej Babiš&#39;s ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Schwarzenberg comments on the turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party leadership last year, declared that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democracy:
&quot;Leading functionaries of the democratic party like little boys go to the head of state to allow them a coup in the party.&quot;
&quot;I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and more intelligent.&quot;
&quot;Because I&#39;ve never seen something so impatiently stupidly executed in my life,&quot; added the chairman of TOP 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (whom he faced in the fight for the presidency), he blurted out: &quot;The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over the party.&quot;
TOP 09 has already submitted the first laws.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally presented its first draft laws in the House of Representatives, including Farského&#39;s register of contracts, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with the early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the chairman of TOP 09 claims that such speed is due to the fact that &quot;these laws are needed&quot;.
At the same time, TOP 09 obviously wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the electoral leader of the ANO movement, Martin Komárek, accused TOP 09 in the pre-election campaign of &quot;stealing&quot; the program of the ANO movement with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 now took advantage of the lead - it simply brushed aside the proposal, which had already entered the second parliamentary reading.
Coulson hacked into his phone to verify the tip
Former News of the world (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; methods to confirm a fraudulent tip about an affair involving the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that the News of the World picked up false reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his &quot;attractive special adviser&quot; Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby&#39;s voicemail and invade her privacy, but the court heard Coulson had also called her and left her voicemails.
&quot;The DA suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not someone who stands outside a house hoping to catch people outside, but someone who likes to push stories to people to see what they have to say,&quot; said Mr Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three methods of investigating stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, tracking, he must know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, &quot;But of course he knows.&quot;
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW newspaper&#39;s reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs Pawlby was told: &quot;You&#39;re wasting your time, she&#39;s with Charles.&quot;
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair&#39;s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator&#39;s computer where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as &quot;The Projects.&quot;
During the time Ms. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former Correspondent James Weatherup oversaw the tracking of Mrs Pawlby&#39;s movements.
Coulson left her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, telling her, &quot;I&#39;ve got a story we&#39;re going to publish tomorrow that I&#39;d love to talk to Charles about.&quot;
Mr Edis says Coulson&#39;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as that of other high-profile figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr Blunkett about having an affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup pleaded guilty to phone hacking.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theater on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people by the interview method.
Fay&#39;s innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of solo comedy institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year - with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
&quot;Most of these titles have appeared at the Carolines and become successful to the point where they are too big to be played in a club,&quot; Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year&#39;s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; the annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year&#39;s festival came from non-traditional outlets, such as shows on smaller radio or television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll hit the ground running with his sitcom (the hilariously spicy fantasy-football-themed &quot;League&quot; on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both &quot;Saturday night live&quot; and &quot;Parks and recreation&quot; but is most famous for her fast-spreading &quot;Marcel the shell with shoes on&quot; video series.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with distinctly recognizable voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the acerbic, racially charged W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but went on to become a successful television and film director, as well as the unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called &quot;Sit down comedy with David Steinberg&quot; on TV Land.
The meeting is held at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
&quot;This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry&#39;s work,&quot; Steinberg said.
He told me that when he&#39;s here, he sometimes walks down the alley between the two buildings and thinks to himself, man, if I lose all my money, I might as well live here.
Many things have moved, and things are different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman Štěch was stirring up discord.
Governor Chovanec was suspicious to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
Chairman Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen mainly showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice President Zaorálek made himself impossible most by an interview on television.
Based on this, I see no better option than for the ČSSD to propose Senate Vice-President Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one who would not have an initial handicap and I think she would perform standardly.
This is such a good solution that hardly any of the management will support it.
I add that this solution is the only option to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could easily form a minority government with only the blessing of President Babiš and without the People&#39;s Party, but with the People&#39;s Party Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a devout social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper law on the referendum, and the chairman of Úsvit Okamura has pledged to support it.
Chairman Babiš would eventually come to terms with the progression of taxes, because he is smart and will see that it is not possible without it.
The People&#39;s Party would not cause problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in the government.
The same applies to YES, there would be a valuable minister here too, but if they sensibly don&#39;t want to enter risky government involvement, but provide support, fine too.
Let&#39;s give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Bárta&#39;s detention is related to Janoušek and Bém: Are they behind the wiretapping leak?
The head of Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, head of the analytics and informatics department of the anti-corruption police, was also detained with him.
The detention is related to the wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about wiretapping, which came from the Novinky.cz server, was confirmed to the Czech Press Office by a reliable source.
The intercepted phone calls between Janoušek and Bém, which were published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other as &quot;Mazánka&quot; and &quot;Kolibríka&quot;, show Janoušek&#39;s influence on the actions of the city under Bém&#39;s leadership.
The newspaper stated at the time that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they were leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was then owned by Bárta.
The Novinky.cz server pointed out that the detained criminal Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek joined the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretapping, at the same time that they were published.
&quot;With respect to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything at all,&quot; said prosecutor Michal Muravský from the Municipal Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he supervises the case.
The inspection does not want to comment on the case for the same reason.
They also arrested an anti-corruption police officer with Vít Bárta
Bárt&#39;s lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of the alleged corruption of VV deputies, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: &quot;Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but due to the protection of classified facts, I cannot comment further.&quot;
According to Práva, the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS) is handling the case.
The tn.cz server stated that Bárta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case could be related to the case of former police chief Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the position Bárta allegedly sought.
However, the latest information from Prava shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, the spokeswoman for the police presidium, refused to comment on the matter, saying that the case is being dealt with by the Prague city council.
&quot;We will not comment on this question due to the protection of classified information,&quot; Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Municipal Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Prague, told Prav on Friday.
It is the local prosecutor who oversees Bárt&#39;s case, and it indirectly follows from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under secrecy.
The Novinek reporter managed to catch up with Vít Bárta&#39;s wife Kateřina Klasnová in the morning in front of their residence in Prague&#39;s Klárov.
She was just loading her suitcases into the car and was leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole incident.
On Friday morning, Tomio Okamura, the leader of the Úsvit movement, commented on Bárt&#39;s arrest.
According to him, he has no idea what the case is about.
&quot;Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate list, and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura&#39;s Dawn of Direct Democracy,&quot; he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for Tomio Okamura&#39;s Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the past early elections to the House of Representatives in the Pilsen region, is known for his corruption case of bribing members of the Public Affairs Department.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months suspended for 30 months.
Later, the sentence was changed and Bárta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mozambique&#39;s security are escalating due to the conflict between powerful figures
Under a statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique&#39;s founding president, thousands gathered in central Maputo to chant slogans of peace in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, the investment firm&#39;s chief executive.
Fearing for her country&#39;s future, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with the words &quot;we demand safety&quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital&#39;s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and the Renamo party, some of the worst fighting since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize that country&#39;s independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to re-emerge into open conflict, but recent events have spooked foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the Northwest could bring investments worth more than $50 billion over the next few years from companies such as Brazil&#39;s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy&#39;s Eni and America&#39;s Anadarko .
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the resulting tensions.
Renamo says the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on September 17.
Violent attacks on former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked a Renamo base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group&#39;s leader, Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflicts because it is said to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to ease fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French news agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;whatever is left of his power to try to prove that he can dictate his own decisions to the government&quot;.
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns grew when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace accord.
He told the FT that he meant Frelimo was no longer honoring the agreement.
&quot;Our aim is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions between the parties, fueled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It&#39;s a fight between two big personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither is a good negotiator and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been pushing for electoral changes, has already said it would boycott local elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the moribund movement to gain favors and financial gain from the government.
Renamo&#39;s electoral share has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country&#39;s democracy.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn&#39;t want transparent elections, he doesn&#39;t want peace because he doesn&#39;t want to let go of the presidency,&quot; Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but it has carried out devastating terror attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south road.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo but is home to the city of Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale rely on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga would not comment on whether Renamo would repeat its threat.
Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,&quot; Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many are also worried about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.
&quot;People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he says.
Protester Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
&quot;Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want to have free access to the roads,&quot; he says.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
A former New South Wales (Australia) Labor minister will be investigated by the state&#39;s corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the offshore lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Committee Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several ministers of state to have his lease at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without having to seek his expiration in August 2005 to participate in the selection process.
The committee is now investigating claims that Mr Tripodi knew about Mr Obeid&#39;s secret interests in the properties, based on evidence given on Thursday by Mr Tripodi&#39;s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks that began in 2005, the government pushed for the leases to go to public tenders.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, the leases for businesses at Circular Quay, which had brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need for a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Ports Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, Mr Tripodi admitted, had been pushing for a shift in the government&#39;s rent policy.
A call transcript produced at ICAC showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ports Department after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
&quot;Was the development of commercial lettings policy discussed during those phone calls?&quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.
&quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can&#39;t remember what we talked about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.

The dog rolled up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lány.
What is his health condition?
Cabbage is bubbling in Kunovice, they don&#39;t add chemicals to it
In the coming months, they want to produce more than a thousand tons of sauerkraut in Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here started in October and will last for about half a year.
The healthy delicacy has been produced here since 1925 in the traditional way, i.e. by stomping directly in large tanks.
This is a rarity in the modern industrial age.
Our workers walk a route of almost ten kilometers per shift.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, it takes three shifts to fill one,&quot; said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
Heads of cabbage are brought to the company premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsk and Břeclavsk.
Fruta employees then clean the vegetables, remove the skins and throw them into the grinder.
From there, the chopped cabbage falls into the six-meter-deep pools, in which trampers dressed in white clothes and wellies work tirelessly.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with a sheet and weighed down with water.
&quot;The cabbage crumb then ripens for six to eight weeks under spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances,&quot; emphasized director Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, the individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage goes to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet and sour pickle in bags or jars and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It also registers interest in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Damkové is said to prohibit UEFA from publishing punishments for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees commission of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing punishments for referees.
UEFA rules forbid it, as she stated in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, FAČR would be threatened with punishment.
Damková also denied that in her capacity she would favor the footballers of Pilsen, where she comes from.
These speculations are really nonsense.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote, I can lose 1:6,&quot; Damková said in response to criticism that erupted after Plzeň had recently taken twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although FAČR has stopped publishing punishments for referees in recent months, Damková assures that referees are punished for their mistakes.
&quot;Believe me that if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, they will limit his delegation, whatever the match,&quot; Damková declared.
According to Damková, the reason why the punishments are not published is a ban from the European Football Union.
&quot;UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and severely punishes violations.&quot;
&quot;We are very suspicious here and look for something behind every mistake.&quot;
&quot;We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don&#39;t stop it, there will be severe sanctions,&quot; said Damková.
Other countries respect the ban.
&quot;We were really the exception,&quot; she added.
If the publication of the information were to continue, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
&quot;And you are very important to us.&quot;
&quot;Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the referee training program,&quot; added Damková.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Center seems to be successfully bucking this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit forecast and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its full-year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, down from its previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current trends are maintained, this will represent a twelve to seventeen percent increase over the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Chief executive Graham Turner said Flight Center made an eight per cent profit in the first half and started the second half with strong growth, mainly in Australian and UK non-business travel.
&quot;To date, 10 of our countries are profitable and several are on track for record annual earnings before interest and taxes,&quot; he said.
This includes Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
The leisure activity business picked up in Australia during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Center performed well in leisure, while corporate clients spent less.
The US business recovered from a loss during a seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to post its third consecutive full-year profit.
Shares in Flight Center were 3 cents higher at $38.20 yesterday.
British police served Assange with an extradition notice
British police today served an extradition notice on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had served the 40-year-old Australian with an &quot;extradition notice&quot; asking him to attend a police station and face arrest if he did not.
Assange exhausted his options under British law when the High Court this month threw out his appeal against extradition, and he faces extradition to Sweden on sex crime charges.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would extradite him to the USA, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he asked the South American country for asylum.
Scotland Yard &quot;served an extradition notice on the 40-year-old man asking him to attend a police station on the date and time specified&quot;, a spokesman said.
Assange continues to breach bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face espionage charges for publishing 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court ruled: Netimes can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court decided that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can be prosecuted even for possible crimes that he may have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House of Commons.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchore, on the other hand, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
With this decision, the court rejected the proposal of public prosecutor Ivo Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings against the deputies.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies in exchange for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be prosecuted.
Aircraft manufacturers are fighting over seat width, big orders are at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights has flared up among leading aircraft manufacturers, sparking a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai Air Show this month.
At issue is the width of the seats provided on long-haul economy class flights - not exactly the kind airlines would normally shy away from, but whose allocated space is key to the efficiency claims of the latest planes offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards to offer at least 46cm wide seats in economy class, but main US rival Boeing says that is up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute comes as planemakers compete to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with a potential record number of orders expected during the Nov. 17-21 event.
How the rear of the aircraft is laid out - particularly whether there are 9 or 10 seats abreast - is the basis of the economic performance claims for new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; aircraft designs.
Boeing says the upgraded &quot;777X&quot; will carry 406 people in economy seats more than 17 inches wide, spread 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46cm wide economy seats spread across 9 rows.
The giant aircraft often challenge each other on technical issues through advertisements in trade media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently previewed what could be the start of a new ad war when he showed financiers a picture of three people huddled in a restaurant with the caption &quot;Would you like it?&quot;
&quot;Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turboprops,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but airplane seats haven&#39;t changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, to the turn of the century, the weight of the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
According to US health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to the seating concept of the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research which suggests that widening the seat by 2.5cm will improve sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing rejects Airbus&#39; seat dimensions, saying it is not within the plane makers&#39; power to decide how airlines balance fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just seat width.
&quot;It&#39;s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful,&quot; said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don&#39;t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, more elbow room is essential, but for suppliers, it&#39;s a growing problem that can affect revenue.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with business estimated to be worth at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the scales of US and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, seat layout is exactly what&#39;s driving the battle between the latest planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim their latest twin-engine long-haul designs are 20 percent more efficient than the market leader in the segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing&#39;s performance claims hinge in part on comparing the design of the 10-abreast 777X to the 9-abreast 777 concept.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
&quot;The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram in more seats and make their planes more competitive against our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say the 10-abreast cabins for existing 777 models are consistent with many passengers favoring a tighter layout that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
&quot;A forty-five-centimeter-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business perspective for Airbus, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777,&quot; said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply the seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft salesmen even carry tape measures to check competing layouts.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density layout aircraft for low-cost carriers and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its planes.
Without the backing of a single other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for new industry standards will go unheeded but could discourage a wave of 777X sales.
CME will target the TV business.
They will fire almost a quarter of the people.
CME media group to lay off.
He wants to lose a thousand people by the end of the year.
He intends to cut all side activities and focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of approximately 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television stations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CET 21 is a part of CME, which holds licenses for the broadcasting of TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
It is not yet clear how much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs approximately 650 people, and what it will mean for the number one domestic television station, TV Nova.
&quot;It&#39;s premature and we really can&#39;t comment on it,&quot; said Nova&#39;s communications director Josef Koukolíček.
According to MF DNES information, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the greatest impact should be on the personnel levels of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Nova&#39;s new chiefs Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who succeeded longtime director Adriano Sarbu, both spoke on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that they want to scale back all activities not directly related to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that they will significantly reduce the costs of producing their own programs, filming and production activities.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
A group that owns thousands of defunct Nortel&#39;s patents filed a patent infringement lawsuit Thursday against cellphone makers including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel&#39;s bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought Nortel&#39;s patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in US District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the suit says, which is core to Google&#39;s search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google&#39;s Android operating system, which competes strongly with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel&#39;s patents.
Google raised its offer several times, eventually offering up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in a battle over Nortel&#39;s patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola&#39;s patent pool.
&quot;Despite unsuccessful attempts to obtain the patents at issue at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents,&quot; the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it says Google&#39;s patent infringement is intentional, the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another independence horror story.
This time there is a warning that a condition for an independent Scotland&#39;s membership in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian&#39;s Wall.
It is true that the Strathclyde paper did mention the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – predictably – this did not make the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that EU member states spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
With Scotland now not in Schengen, an offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession to Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it&#39;s a pretty weak story.
And, moreover, so old that it became an excavation. I heard the journalistic duck that &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; at least 40 years ago.
Nevertheless, there is an interesting idea hidden in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland even be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade London&#39;s grip for Brussels&#39;, especially now?
This is the real European story: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties devoted to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany - founded this year - came seemingly out of nowhere and already captured almost five million votes in the September federal election, essentially &quot;sweeping&quot; the Free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been resistance at home to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
Austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket placed on national economies through clinging to a single currency, have led many to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running high budget deficits – this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that locks its members into exchange rates favorable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, Southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut income and public spending - which Germany encourages.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper cause of Europe&#39;s lackluster performance.
As a result of Brussels-backed &quot;green&quot; energy policies -- code for supporting French and German firms at the expense of consumers -- European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen with Grangemouth.
Not even all the wage freezes in the world would prevent Europe&#39;s petrochemical industry from being trampled by cheap US shale oil.
The result is a smoldering rebellion, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to position itself in the world on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy, and has enforced its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen&#39;s right wing, the anti-European National Front, just won a crucial by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - an early warning to British Labor that they cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically translate positively to the left.
How is Le Pen handling her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year&#39;s European elections to create an anti-European bloc working against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
It occurs to me that in the foreseeable future the growing anti-European feeling and the attitude against the common currency will combine and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but will rather be transformed into something freer in the sense of &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations&quot;, which was favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect Great Britain to distance itself from this project and align itself with the United States.
However, Washington&#39;s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area of (basically) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – that includes telling Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed European setup provided it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should follow the example of Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a large majority in 2011 thanks to its opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labor Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to accept austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;gender indeterminate&quot;
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to list any gender for such children, allowing them to list the gender as &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressure on parents to hastily decide on gender reassignment surgery for their child and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years: &quot;I am neither male nor female.&quot;
I will remain a doctor-made patchwork, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born each year who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available and determine it, rather than wait and monitor the child&#39;s psychological and physical development until it is done surgery, if any.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-assignment issues, said the new German law &quot;looks like a good thing.&quot;
Intersex children present an ethical dilemma.
&quot;Some individuals are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,&quot; he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery and then one can wait as the identity develops.
Knowing how a child&#39;s gender will develop is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It&#39;s like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological make-up, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as neither.
These traits can be manifested in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair growth, bust and stature, in primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Non-gender boys now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to indicate male, female or &quot;third gender&quot; on official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian woman, became the world&#39;s first recognized &quot;genderless&quot; person in June when she won a court appeal to keep her &quot;indeterminate&quot; gender status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in addition to M (male) and F (female), German passports will also have a third designation, X, for intersex people.
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, the issue of gender is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also criticized the German law, writing: &quot;As the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization upside down.&quot;
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told Baby zone that she would prefer to see babies assigned a gender at birth.
&quot;Parenting itself is stressful even without the restrictions, especially if you don&#39;t know the gender of your baby,&quot; she told a parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek who had two genders.
And about a decade ago, the medical community believed that gender was something like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But many are now questioning the ethical basis of the surgery, saying gender is a complex issue and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they don&#39;t know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
&quot;In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency room,&quot; Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn&#39;t call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
An enduring theory on how to deal with gender-ambiguous children was put forth by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the new term &quot;gender&quot; and argued that social causes and environmental influences—how parents raised their child—acted on a child&#39;s genes and hormones to shape the child regardless of whether he or she identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case known as &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theory became moot.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poorly performed circumcision to have their child castrated completely, his testicles removed, and to raise him as a girl.
&quot;The media presented this case as a successful conversion case, but the reality was different,&quot; Drescher said.
When the boy was 15, he had surgery to turn himself back into a boy and married a woman.
However, he committed suicide at the age of 38.
Drescher said some doctors &quot;use this model&quot; to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these surgeries emerged &quot;dissatisfied with the outcome.&quot;
This was also the case for Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never live a &quot;satisfying life&quot; as a man.
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce&#39;s external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
&quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 he was sent for vaginal plastic surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for the medical records.
What he found was horrifying.
I was sterilized after birth and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (DSD), which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to allow his genitals to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone and had his breasts removed,
The operations made him infertile.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project, which seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigmatization.&quot;
&quot;Many activists fear that the German law will encourage parents to make a snap decision and choose an &#39;indeterminate&#39; for their child,&quot; she said.
We fear that this will prompt intervention.
We think it&#39;s better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don&#39;t know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it &quot;allows adults to choose to be assigned a third gender&quot;.
&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,&quot; she said.
German law is going to allocate it at birth.
That is a battle that a young child should not be fighting at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh thoracic radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law would &quot;empower&quot; both parents and children.
Baratz&#39;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie has developed female features.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and working as a child psychiatry intern as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
&quot;The law will give parents some space so that they don&#39;t rush their decision,&quot; said Baratzová.
It gives them time to run some tests and think about it and it gives them time to write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;.
In that regard, everything is fine - you are raising and loving your child.
You have a wonderful baby and you are happy about it.
You don&#39;t need to rush into surgery, which is irreversible.
&quot;It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said.
Ultimately, the child will decide which gender they identify with more - and that&#39;s a great thing.
It empowers children to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from an oil rig in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was brought ashore after being found emaciated on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One rattlesnake was airlifted to Aberdeen last month after previously being treated by the Scottish SPCA at a rescue center until he recovered.
Operations Centre&#39;s Colin Seddon said: &quot;This rattlesnake is likely to have migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by strong winds over the North Sea.&quot;
Apparently he ran out of strength and took refuge on an oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: &quot;He was unable to take off again so they contacted us for help.&quot;
At the time the rattlesnake was released, it was in good condition and healthy.
Znojmo starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by construction workers who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the municipal stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Nízké Jeseník in recent times (from a geological point of view).
The last eruptions here were at the beginning of the Quaternary.
When viewed from a greater distance, on the top of Uhlířský vrch, the white-plastered baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765, is striking.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church has not survived.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an avenue of four rows of linden trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The Stations of the Cross on Uhlířský vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by the local artistic carver František Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the Nízké Jeseník region.
Similarly, plinths made of rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated at each stop.
Uhlířský vrch is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements vary somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudny (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venus volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born from an explosion.
During it, it ejected a considerable amount of volcanic ash together with rock fragments from the bedrock, which were burnt to a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters thick.
The second eruption spewed out red, brown-red, and in some places even black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters thick and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
In the tuffs there are conspicuous volcanic pumas up to 1 meter in size. The second eruption was also ended by an outpouring of lava.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms a layer of slag-like basalt up to 50 m thick.
Volcanoes that alternate between ejecting volcanic ash and lava flows are the most common type of volcano.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, it was only threatened by the mining of rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuffs were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and low cohesion of the rocks, which quickly weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The quarry thus disappears relatively quickly.
To further complicate the situation, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal location for some rare species of plants and animals.
The remedy is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
You can reach Uhlířský vrch by following the green tourist sign from Bruntál or from Slezské Kočov.
Motorists can use the free parking lot at the beginning of the linden avenue, where a short educational trail also begins.
A drunkard doused the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
The tension was increasing, the fear was increasing.
The man started threatening to set the whole house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire department, went to the scene.
A police negotiator also arrived at the scene and tried to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
The emergency unit had to break into the house, which neutralized and handcuffed the man.
The aggressor then ended up being examined at a hospital in Mladá Boleslav, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol detention center.
Firefighters eventually covered the house doused in gasoline with a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to people, all domestic animals were also rescued from the house.
The man did not give in to the police negotiator, so the commando went after him.
Anger over sentence handed down for Bali bombing mastermind
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings have reacted angrily to the verdict handed down on the last of the masterminds to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia&#39;s most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for assembling the explosive devices used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of church bombings in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution had sought a life sentence, although it could have insisted that the man nicknamed the &quot;Demolition man&quot; because of his reputation as an expert in making explosives receive the death penalty.
The decision rekindled painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastating attack launched by Patek and other trainers nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Ms Corteen told AAP: &quot;He should be put in front of the firing squad.&quot;
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was leveled when a powerful bomb placed in a van parked outside was detonated shortly after 11pm on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy&#39;s bar where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had detonated a rucksack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was being kept alive, the doctors &quot;died&quot; three times.
Mr Hughes said Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jama&#39;a Islamiya terror cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no other.
Keeping him alive... there&#39;s just no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not so much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He eluded arrest for almost a decade, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
&quot;He didn&#39;t surrender voluntarily,&quot; said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt remorse for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
&quot;We&#39;re going to see a lot of tears this year,&quot; Ms Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals hold the highest position in the Catholic Church&#39;s clergy after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope - the group is thus reduced to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a gathering of current cardinals, known as a consistory, will be held before the new cardinals are formally promoted.
&quot;Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to drop by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as are needed to bring the electorate back up to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Next year&#39;s consistory will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and especially Italy.
&quot;It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
&quot;Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said.
He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
But we haven&#39;t been in this situation before - it&#39;s completely new.
Valero said that popes have traditionally elevated bishops from major places to cardinals, but Francis is &quot;full of surprises — so we don&#39;t know who he&#39;s appointing.&quot;
Series of racing Land Rovers announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercom equipment.
Options include upgraded brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racers that come to Bowler have changed.
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an attainable path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to be able to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and we believe this format offers a new way to experience the different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas and will prepare competitors for the rigors and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We&#39;ve really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge - it&#39;s going to be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week&#39;s Strings of Autumn
Saxophone great and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will end the 18th annual Strings of Autumn festival next Wednesday.
Shorter will perform at the Lucerne Grand Hall on November 6 with his quartet consisting of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined with a spontaneous jazz improvisation by the PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter&#39;s arrangements for symphony orchestra will feature Pegasus from his new album Without A Net, as well as his earlier compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his eightieth birthday this August, Shorter is still full of energy, which is also proven by the fact that the Prague concert at Struny Podzim will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music over sixty years ago.
The list of artists he has worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the direction of the new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past thirteen years, he has been performing mainly with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
A sort of after-party after the festival will be the Spotlight club night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin will introduce themselves to the domestic audience with their jazz influenced by electronics and the young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
US commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and returned.
Without being swayed by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and are no longer commenting on it.
The exact opposite of the confused and bigoted, unsupported actions of Obama&#39;s Syria policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don&#39;t be fooled by the media&#39;s claims that a &quot;Syrian base&quot; or &quot;Hezbollah supplies&quot; were bombed.
I recently wrote here that while US aid to the country&#39;s secular rebels remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply Syria with weapons.
And it was the fresh shipment of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And note, again, Israel bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although popular internet theories say it should be the other way around.
The US government awarded 2 members of the space units, probably Delta force.
It was not known until now that they distinguished themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two ex-SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city is known, I think they were members of the secret commando of the CIA, which is made up of ex-soldiers.
There has long been speculation as to what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA residence elsewhere.
Now it&#39;s clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (it was on one such that both SEALs were killed after being hit by a mortar) is rather surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the American commandos in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news about the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, shot their way to the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is blamed for the fact that during that attack the commando was not deployed officially and in full, and that it simply hesitated about what to do.
The commander of the commando will apparently release these volunteers without orders.
In any case, the fact that American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors operate in the country not once, but permanently, is quite interesting information.
And this is due to the fact that, until recently, nothing of the sort was officially acknowledged, and now there is only talk of a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US is trying, albeit half-heartedly, to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although it would take a lot more help to solve the national situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not too long ago, the media almost sang the praises of Iran&#39;s air force for pursuing US drones.
However, little is known about how the Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to discover your drone in the airspace, nothing can be done about it.
However, if a drone is discovered by the Iranians in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that an Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in international space above the sea, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American F-22 Raptor super fighter in history took place.
He flew past the Phantom to optically check its armament without the Phantom registering it on the radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared near it and told the Iranian pilot to return home, the Phantom obeyed without complaint.
It is not surprising when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but it remembers the war in Vietnam.
Can&#39;t compare to the Raptor.
The court blocked an order regarding the NYPD&#39;s stop-and-frisk procedures
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department&#39;s stop-and-frisk program and removed a judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin&#39;s decision would be stayed pending a decision on an appeal filed by the city.
A judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by implementing its stop-and-frisk program.
The city challenged her findings and her remedial orders, including the decision to assign a supervisor to help the police department change its procedures and its associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge must be removed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges by failing to act as a judge required to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and a public statement in which she openly she responded to the criticism of the court.
A judge ruled that police officials violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongfully targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an independent watchdog to oversee major changes, including reforms to procedures, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some areas where people are stopped the most.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police search.
Oral arguments on the city&#39;s appeal are scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Stop and frisks have existed in some form for decades, but recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, mostly of blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed what became a class action case.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD&#39;s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force and could influence how other police departments use the procedures.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police morale but not crime, and that it will waste money but not solve the wider problem of a police force under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stop-and-frisk people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD conducted the searches.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) released a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies is on the rise.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how to make teachers and staff aware of children&#39;s food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
He also recommends that schools have adrenaline on hand — the EpiPen brand auto-injector is most commonly used — to be able to respond to a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms appearing in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child may say, &quot;It feels like someone is poking my tongue,&quot; &quot;I feel like I have hairs on my tongue,&quot; or &quot;My tongue is itchy.&quot;
How Tipsport (does not) delete personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on the Tipsport.cz website.
However, I didn&#39;t finish it afterwards, because there was someone sitting at the branch who couldn&#39;t complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn&#39;t want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and because of that, my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it is not possible because I have a different OP number, address and that it simply cannot be completed and that I should request the deletion of the data and perform a new registration.
That is what I did and on 24/10/2013 I wrote to technical support that I am requesting the deletion of all my personal data from the database in accordance with the applicable law on the protection of personal data.
After that, the technical support wrote to me the other day that I should complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after the 4th emergency on 25.10. they wrote that they deleted personal data at my request.
So one would think that he could do the new registration and here the problems started again, first it told me that my username is already taken (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but in the end they deleted this too).
So I used a different username and it jumped out at me that they already have my personal data saved to complete the registration at the branch (how can they save something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, they wrote back to me that they really deleted the personal data on 10/25. and to send an email with that error.
I did that (yesterday at around 3 p.m.) and today they wrote back to me that I registered on the same day (October 31, 2013) at 1:22 p.m. and that it was not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I&#39;ve been contacting technical support for a week and I&#39;m dealing with them that it still doesn&#39;t work.
And what about the fact that if what he claims were true (as it is not) no one with the same name or the same date of birth could register if this is already registered.
By the way, at 13.22 I actually registered, with the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictitious e-mail and phone number, and wow, I got a page that they sent me a link to complete the registration by e-mail.
But how is this possible when you cannot register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to an e-mail and a phone number and simply did not exclude the data as they claim.
So I again told the technical support that they are simply lying (either on purpose or they don&#39;t know what they are writing), because what they are writing is not true.
I documented several screenshots that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so &quot;fake&quot; registration simply has no effect on this.
Tipsport wrote back to me with a stern sentence - I&#39;m sorry, but since you&#39;re already registered again, we can&#39;t verify your claim.
And he ended the communication.
In other words, he repeats the same sentence over and over, that registration is linked to name and date of birth.
They can&#39;t even accept the fact that the registration wasn&#39;t completed by clicking on that link in the email, so it didn&#39;t even go through.
So to sum it up, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as they claim, but they lie when they say otherwise.
What&#39;s worse is that it&#39;s easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer&#39;s side.
By the way, after mentioning this matter on my personal blog, things started to move a bit and an email came from Technical Support saying that they are forwarding the matter for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgent care and arguing and being notified of the same error).
We regret the killing, but we are innocent, the representatives of the Khmer Rouge defend themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge&#39;s 1975-1979 mix of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population, died from exhaustion, starvation, disease, torture and execution.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by saying they believed they were acting in the best interest of the nation and had no idea the true scale of the killings.
&quot;It is easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation,&quot; Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority,&quot; he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to &quot;mistreat people or kill them, deny them food or commit genocide&quot;.
But he admitted &quot;moral responsibility&quot; for the dead.
&quot;I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people,&quot; he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che&#39;s apology.
“He lied to us.
“He just wants to be exonerated.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t care about others,&quot; she declared.
&quot;If he had not given orders, his subordinates would not have killed,&quot; she added, adding that Khmer Rouge leaders were &quot;worse than monsters.&quot;
The &quot;foreign minister&quot; of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, was also supposed to stand trial, but he died in March this year.
His wife Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent by a court in September 2012 due to dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has produced the first ice cream that glows in the dark - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this sea animal and developed a luminous treat.
He got the idea after reading a scholarly treatise on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes the jellyfish to glow.
This ice cream reacts with the tongue of the consumer - it increases the pH level of the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream glows when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more you lick it, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of the Lick me I&#39;m delicious ice cream company, says: “It&#39;s a wonderful substance, but we&#39;re at the beginning in terms of production, so for £200 you get about 2g of the substance. &quot;
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We&#39;ve been testing it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea for a Halloween party because it creates this fantastic glowing effect.
It&#39;s probably the most expensive ice cream I&#39;ve ever made, because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each scoop costs me about £140.
But it tastes great.
Based in Bristol, Charlie&#39;s experimental company is known for its unconventional beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf flavours.
But his next product is to be even more ambitious.
He says, &quot;I really wish I could make invisible ice cream.&quot;
It&#39;s basically impossible due to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I reckon we&#39;ll find some way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
They want to make ski areas cheaper for families with children
The price of oil fell further to 96 dollars per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high inventories were offset by a report that showed a strengthening of China&#39;s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel in late morning European electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the drop was 39 cents, and for the month of October, it fell by 5.8 percent.
Abundant oil supplies have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said on Wednesday that US inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, inventories have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, a boost to more demand came from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed growth in activity.
That suggests China&#39;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two decades of weakness.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the International Mercantile Exchange in London.
Martin Doktor on the problems with the Olympics in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth hint at a slight smile, and then he just exhales deeply, &quot;It&#39;s challenging.&quot;
According to Martin Doktor, cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a bit more complicated.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
&quot;Nothing works the same,&quot; says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work more slowly and not as accurately.
It&#39;s so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of delivering information regarding essential matters, not so much.
For example, we have been asking them for three months to provide us with how individual villages will be officially marked, so that we can do a whole range of things accordingly.
We are still waiting and they keep saying they are communicating the thing.
They still communicate about many things.
Is the Olympic village already completed?
But it is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean that they are empty?
Do you need finished floors?
Just basic concrete, so that was the situation a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there as a vanguard on January 26, there will still be a smell of glue.
And if they couldn&#39;t keep up, what would happen?
Do you think President Putin would send the army there?
That&#39;s probably how it will turn out.
Just to make sure that Olympic villages = Potemkin villages.
Rather, there is a risk that they will not have time, for example, to adjust the roads, they will not complete the details.
Maybe the roads will be in such a state that we&#39;ll have to take our London Games wellies with us.
But I believe that somehow they will put it together.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although that number changes depending on the nomination criteria.
For example, the figure skaters will probably go in the trio that they set out with.
No one needs to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise things are in development.
Are you still waiting for your trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I shouldn&#39;t be flying there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves with a meter so that we don&#39;t just trust the sketches.
We are also preparing a whole range of other things, including transport.
And what does the head of the mission do one hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports, plus I am doing the regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Post-election stew instead of post-election tenderloin
The October elections produced a bunch of losers rather than winners.
It is not only the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD due to its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-election goulash at the weekend instead of a holiday tenderloin.
The movement of Andrej Babiš became the jumping-off point of the elections, which promised voters to change the current political style of governance.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party shows the political (dis)will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president lost his strategic advantage over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has several ways to regain it - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD&#39;s chances of winning the prime minister&#39;s seat are receding in my eyes, they are getting closer to businessman Andrej Babiš.
The post-election development is still miles away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by the communists, this development is better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy after all.
Given the loud opposition of ANO to join forces with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 MPs).
Given the split in the ČSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite discouraging for the ČSSD.
The ČSSD minority government made up of &quot;non-Zemans&quot; will probably not pass in the Castle.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD participates will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself: &quot;Aren&#39;t we headed for another snap election?&quot;
The next election would be more like a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the ANO movement.
ČSSD&#39;s plans to introduce sectoral taxes, more significant increases in income taxes or building a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
The parties ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit, on the other hand, agree, for example, on support for entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support for the employment of disadvantaged people, reduction of the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Friction surfaces are most common in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
ANO has the upper hand now, so the program of the most likely coalition of ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.
Which, from my point of view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that still moves in the economy.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, wasting money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, raising taxes and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this state of affairs.
That it didn&#39;t really matter to them and that they were actually satisfied with the state that was there (stealing and indebtedness of this state).
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not turn up for the elections, 596,357 voters voted for TOP, 09,384,174 voters voted for ODS, so a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all valid voters.
Which is an overwhelming majority.
If I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above-mentioned parties, then 64.23% of valid voters actually agreed with the old order (because all the mentioned parties participated in the &quot;robbing&quot; and indebtedness of this state).
In this way, the majority of voters showed that they are not in favor of punishing the perpetrators of theft and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the ČSSD who participated in this will stand up for the appropriate laws?
Is there any help for us?
Olomouc will open a public ice rink in the historic center
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, Pavel Spálený, said that preparatory work on the ice rink began on October 26, and that the ice production unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took up 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two punch stands available.
&quot;We expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stalls, and almost the entire area of the stage is covered so that the skaters can change their shoes comfortably,&quot; described Spálený.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, due to the repair of Dolní náměstí, the ice rink was installed right in front of the main entrance of the town hall on Horní náměstí.
The repair of Dolní náměstí was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city&#39;s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched on Horní náměstí a month before Christmas Day.
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog&#39;s mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog&#39;s point of view), while nervous dogs wag their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can pick up on and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;In humans, it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.&quot;
We tried to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that, just as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In an attempt to learn more about how dogs respond to other dogs&#39; disproportionate tail wagging, researchers monitored animals watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won&#39;t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and other times to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We showed the dogs movies of dogs - either in the natural version or in silhouette - to get rid of any confounding cues, and we were also able to adjust the tail movement to make it appear more to the right or to the left.&quot;
When the animals saw the otherwise inconspicuous dog move its tail to the right (from the perspective of the tail-wagging dog), it remained completely still.
But when she noticed the tail turning predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of the tail-wagging dog), their heart rates increased and the animals appeared uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs consciously communicated with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they need to pay attention to and which they don&#39;t need to pay attention to.
He said: &quot;If you encounter dogs several times and moving their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and moving to the right produces less friendly behavior, you will respond based on that experience.&quot;
The researchers say the findings may help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their animals&#39; emotions.
Dog behaviourist John Bradshaw, an undergraduate lecturer in veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right sides were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when observing an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
And in another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;Dogs were more likely to become familiar with the dog robot when it wagged its tail to the left than to the right, when it was more likely to become uncertain - exactly the opposite of the Italian study.&quot;
The difference, he says, may be due to the fact that the dogs in these various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the dog robots as completely dogs.
He explained that studies of how dogs react to real dogs could help.
&quot;Although there is strong evidence in many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be elucidated – and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won&#39;t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that global probes by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation are on the rise.
Some of the world&#39;s biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with competent authorities in investigations into the world&#39;s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of a widening investigation into the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension but confirmed it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
&quot;Our ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,&quot; the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the matter said RBS handed over to Britain&#39;s Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the former trader&#39;s accounts.
That trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understood to have been relieved of his current position as European head of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher&#39;s instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the matter said.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss watchdog Finma said it was investigating suspected foreign exchange manipulation at several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating claims that these bankers colluded to manipulate the currency market.
In addition, HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through years-old instant messages and emails to find instances of wrongdoing.
News of the investigations alarmed traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of profit-making at investment bank closes in recent years, but which has been disrupted as little currency volatility has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the gravity of the situation by saying that the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that &quot;you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.&quot;
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse said it had this week fired a trader from its equity trading division who caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The bank immediately alerted the relevant authorities and is cooperating with their control bodies.
&quot;We are confident that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved,&quot; Credit Suisse said.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the People&#39;s Party sent Jan Kasal against Babiš.
The People&#39;s Party won fourteen deputies in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter the government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to discuss the contours of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who negotiated the terms of government participation for the People&#39;s Party in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time it will probably resemble the first negotiations in 1992, when ODS was also a completely new party.
&quot;The experience was minimal then,&quot; Kasal estimates how this year&#39;s talks will develop.
Driver fined £1,000 for driving over 200km/h with hot drink between legs
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 210km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to charges of careless and distracted driving.
Seven points were added to his account, as a result of which he received a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and an accused surcharge of £100.
Slept: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the juice, lust and enthusiasm
Family has always been the first priority for Prospal, which is why he wants to fully submit to it at the age of 38.
He will either get a job overseas and extend his career, or quit hockey for good.
&quot;I want to fulfill the role of a father and a husband.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to it,&quot; says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he is a famous worker who never cheats on anything.
Despite the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every time and is able to tear his teammates down with it.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus&#39; most productive player last season.
&quot;But the desire to show everyone is still in me,&quot; he declares determinedly.
Maybe he will wait, the New York Rangers are reportedly interested in him, who failed to enter the season and also have injured two mainstays - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How is your arrival at Rangers?
It&#39;s just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it&#39;s not worth bothering with.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that&#39;s about it.
Nowhere was it added that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce myself that I have some kind of contract, but that&#39;s just not the case.
You didn&#39;t even get a call from the club?
This kind of communication happens every day in the NHL.
It&#39;s about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, for example, a player is injured or someone is not doing well and the team is not working.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, similar circumstances occur, don&#39;t they?
Rick Nash is injured along with Ryan Callahan and the team has not been successful entering the season, so there is some chance, don&#39;t you think?
Of course, there&#39;s always that chance.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides to it.
I would take a lot of offers today, but I haven&#39;t received any yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
You are leaving for America on Friday, are you expecting that something might work out after all?
I&#39;ve had these expectations since July 5th, when the free agent market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Heading to New York to reminisce?
Definitely not, I&#39;m going to Tampa for my kids and my wife.
I&#39;m looking forward to the sun and to seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned somehow?
This is due to the fact that I am a father and a husband, and everything depends on that.
I&#39;m not a hockey player at the moment - I don&#39;t have a contract and I don&#39;t play matches.
So I will be fulfilling the role of father and husband and I am really looking forward to it.
Vašík already has two hockey games on Sunday, that&#39;s a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Thinking you could do this in quotes full time?
Sure, one can think about a lot of things.
This can also happen.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games due to knee surgery.
And I really, really enjoyed it.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, wins and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children are the meaning of life.
Have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You&#39;ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play in the NHL just because it&#39;s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I&#39;m a hockey player, sporting success also comes first - in addition to family.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And family life also depends on this.
My children, I&#39;m sorry, our children - mine and my wife&#39;s - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we would be very happy if they continued this trend.
Because no matter what we say, in America the possibilities are somewhere else entirely.
We should offer them such a chance.
So do you plan to stay in America permanently?
We will practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia in Hluboká and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or wherever our steps take us.
This is absolutely ideal, to be always warm.
I have been extremely lucky in my life.
You can say that I went against him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of opportunities and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we will live.
There are many people in the world who crave this, to be able to choose what they will do and how they will live.
At your age, how long will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, so that&#39;s a question I can&#39;t answer.
Today, I still have it in me, that juice, that lust, that enthusiasm, that passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you&#39;re still in the NHL, that I&#39;m still better than someone else.
But I can&#39;t say how much longer it will stay there.
This cannot be planned.
So it can be said that this season you will wait to see how it unfolds and then decide what to do next?
I&#39;m at a stage where I&#39;m going day by day.
Distant planets, black-and-white films or a bit of fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter throws around casually.
In the view of his quartet, which will close this year&#39;s Strings of Autumn festival on November 6 in the large hall of Prague&#39;s Lucerna, everything is connected to everything.
The score of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter&#39;s quartet is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, colleagues two generations younger should play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in cinematic images.
However, the newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, winner of nine Grammys, former bandmate of Miles Davis and probably the greatest jazz saxophonist alive today - does not like to explain this principle.
He doesn&#39;t talk much about music, although his overall outlook on life is closely related to music.
In my eighties, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life surprise you.
&quot;Too many people plan everything and then are disappointed when things turn out differently,&quot; says Shorter.
Jágr joked: A goal from a break?
He won the puck in the defensive zone and no one caught him.
He also converted the escape after a quick forehand loop.
This is how Jaromír Jágr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening he commented on the 119th winning goal in the NHL on the social network Facebook.
&quot;After watching this video, the director of the Czech Railways contacted my agent Petar Svoboda and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!&quot; wrote Jágr in the introduction with exaggeration.
They say we are very similar in type.
I guess I&#39;ll have to stop my night workouts so I don&#39;t speed up even more.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that the Minister of Defense might call after that and want to advertise jets!&quot; he added smileys.
In addition, New Jersey claimed its second straight victory.
&quot;And most importantly, you noticed - the treatment by Maria Rottra is working,&quot; Jágr concluded.
The brutal murder of an elderly man in the Zlín region will be dealt with again by the regional court
The regional court acquitted the 25-year-old Slovak and the 22-year-old Czech of the charges due to a lack of evidence.
The men pleaded not guilty.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even exceptional punishment.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court overturned the regional decision and sent the matter back to him for consideration.
The judge refused to comment on the reasons that led to this, saying that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men attacked a seventy-seven-year-old man in his home.
The senior died an agonizing death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled, beat and kicked him all over the body and also inflicted about three dozen wounds on his head with a metal object, apparently a gas gun.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as skull fractures, brain swelling or brain bleeding, from which he died on the spot.
The young men allegedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the regional court, the only, moreover, indirect evidence against the defendants were odor traces, which the expert evaluated as not fully established in the sense of legal instructions.
Odor traces from the scene of the crime and on other things did match the defendants in more than ten cases, but the police initially treated them as physical traces and not odor traces.
In addition, certain errors in handling them were found.
According to the panel, the defendants&#39; guilt was not proven beyond doubt.
However, the court recognized that the police had very difficult conditions.
The elderly man was found dead with a fractured head by relatives who thought he must have fallen and injured himself.
Not even the doctor who was called to the emergency service pointed out the violent death.
It was not until a few days later that the criminologists were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of a violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the clues from the crime scene that the relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in the Uherskohradišť region.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed last year by the Olomouc High Court.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men responsible for robberies of gold shops.
The robberies happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of an elderly man in Slopné.
The youngest of those accused of murdering an elderly man lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever do without signature events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with the legendary scene with the ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that collect evidence of harassment of the castle party.
In the past, the traditional influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was never documented in this way, let alone signed.
True, the editors took the lead.
However, the described cases do not provide an answer to the question of where such favoritism of some journalists towards the Zemanovs comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, to avoid vulgarity, a typical manifestation of misplaced empathic friendliness.
And if we already assume general rottenness, one cannot help but wonder if other, no less unscrupulous powerful interests that haven&#39;t had the opportunity yet are trying to change the situation in television.
Those who say that in developed countries there are no such attempts at intervention by politicians in broadcasting are right.
However, it is also true that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
The applicants do not dispute their independence.
On the contrary, they mainly criticize what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we simply have not reached this stage of civilization yet and this situation does not exist here.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides.
As crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear the competition was not going to be easy.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet at school and only took his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted smoothly through three laps to finally claim the top prize, leaving behind 30 trailing adult rivals.
The inseparable pair - of the same height - were praised for their looks, behavior and style at the annual competition run by Sunnybank Equestrian Center in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He faced gentlemen and ladies in smart hats, tipped his beret at a jaunty angle and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to handle horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got top marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee for his third birthday in March and has been training the Shetland pony daily since then.
His mother Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee work great together.&quot;
They didn&#39;t have high hopes, but in the end they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only his second time competing with Toffee and we were thrilled when he won.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and complete strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
The boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells says: &quot;There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and clapping.&quot;
He ran on the sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and the farm and has been put in charge of two chickens.
Given the way he has started, he will soon be in the Horse of the Year competition again and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: &quot;Fenton is only three but he already knows how to handle a pony.&quot;
They make a great team together.
The judges singled out Fenton and Toffee for their excellent presentation and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always look at how good the team work is between the pony and the handler - and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I&#39;m sure Fenton&#39;s adorable outfit helped too, he really fit in there.
Snowden is willing to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has announced that he is willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, are unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, on Thursday and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP handed to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: &quot;Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as defectors and seeks to criminalize political speech with heavy-handed prosecutions that leave no room for for the defense.&quot;
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed support from the international community could persuade the United States government to drop criminal charges against him.
Charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany&#39;s interior minister, told Zeit Online magazine: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.&quot;
Tensions in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when claims emerged that the NSA had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads a parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &quot;without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the US&quot;, it should would do so.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for Germany&#39;s Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his trip to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that, according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia once he left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, a member of parliament said.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said he faced a harsh and sustained campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
But he said the world&#39;s response to his &quot;act of political expression&quot; had given him courage.
Citizens around the world and high-ranking officials – including those in the United States – have hailed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance as a public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot;until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.&quot;
So that I don&#39;t become filled with hatred
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel, Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a thin volume is indicated by the number of pages comparable to his best-known work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
Another significant contemporary Czech writer - Emil Hakl - gave an interview for Salon Kahuda.
What made you write a novel after twelve years of silence?
I did it - so I wouldn&#39;t be filled with hate.
Seeing around him new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, young organisms affected by blind selfish striving.
I&#39;m not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by impotent greed, vekslak souls and oppositely polarized ideologues who try to sell their &quot;product&quot; with the expression of a little sales whore.
At the turn of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my geeky friends, weirdos, and hidden entities.
I&#39;m over it.
Sometimes I feel like my brain is on fire from living on this planet.
I like to go for walks and then read books by the lamp in the evening.
You talk about a sense of doom, of hatred.
Was there a turning point somewhere in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old like we all are?
The turning point happened a long time ago, around ten years ago.
It didn&#39;t have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
But somewhere inside there is still a surprised silent boy.
I see more lonely exercisers, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
Writing books saved me.
I am participating in that vast, millennia-long movement of the life system on this planet - that birth of an elusive future.
That immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir of our presence.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game where, through trial and error, another and another generation of beings is created, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some kind of superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start completely from scratch?
The soliloquy, or better said the dialogue between the right and left halves of the brain, sometimes surfaces and takes the form of a book.
As periods of peace are interwoven with quietly sleeping metastases of wars that may one day awaken - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn&#39;t do something, it would one day silently overwhelm me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and put to the layers that are stored in the darkness &quot;below the surface of consciousness&quot;.
The neocortex, the gray cerebral cortex, questions older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient tree rings of the brain.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, looks for an answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you refer to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has lived through.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, is used by the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, I am exposed to a constantly changing presence, in an unceasing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes overload faults occur.
Analogously - as if your PC &quot;fell down&quot;, from the speech emulator and foreign language translator program you would first get confused in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts you would end up at the dark green flashing Bios screen, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who haven&#39;t yet understood what I&#39;m talking about - I&#39;m talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you regularly interested in this type of regression?
Because it&#39;s a pit.
A gap appears in the previously functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: &quot;He gazed into the abyss for so long that the abyss gazed into him.&quot;
A genuine feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, he psychologically &quot;dies&quot; and a new quality begins.
And why do I care personally?
I will answer with a parable.
Once upon a time, one fell into a pool and drowned, days, months and years went by, he kept drowning while reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a &quot;diver&quot;.
Perhaps a sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal&#39;s texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think about the reader, about the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, others the super-ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
&quot;I am someone else - this reader participates directly in the process of formulating words and sentences.&quot;
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo&#39;s submarine, ran around Stínadly in dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branching of authors and their messages, it reads: &quot;The bright sun of other worlds by Karel Hynek Mácha&quot;.
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader&#39;s opinion?
On the backlash that gets to you through people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some difficult life decision.
Books are actually &quot;lives&quot; or rather &quot;worlds&quot;.
They are encoded in the characters of letters, they carry the experience, the history of the regions of that language.
We can bring them to life at any time by letting their sentences flow into the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbiddenly divine - awakening more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonology books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published - as usual - a chain of author&#39;s readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like to read.
Will you throw yourself into it again with joy, or do you feel differently after years?
Today I prefer to just talk.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic characteristic - they are inconspicuous, they don&#39;t draw too much attention to themselves, they have a friendly aura, you don&#39;t feel lonely with them.
I&#39;ll give an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec there lived (and I hope he still lives) a curly-haired bookseller (his name is aptly Červenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
Over a drink, he introduced me to the individual articles in the chain of readers of my book Houština.
I looked into their eyes and then was shown a tattered, read copy of my book.
Embarrassed, I put down the morning meal I had just read and let out a short manly cry.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and drunkenly crying with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn&#39;t stand it and with a roar jumped headlong out of the window into the snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night landscape and hunted with the happy rage of the sensitive, the aching soul of the compatriots and the longing of the lost patriots - howling and howling like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and in content different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It&#39;s a narrative.
It is a fairy tale about a land behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian fable into the mouth of a folk healer: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
A dog is lying with a gray chest on it.
Horror, terror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps once upon a time we were devils in hell casting lots - what role we would play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or will you leave it to the free flow of inspiration again?
Answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful form of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, affects our will from such a depth and in such a breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so with absolute self-awareness we act exactly according to the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes a breakdown happens and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That&#39;s the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shore of the ocean of unconsciousness, catching the tides of the balmy wind in a leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on maths, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, it will be necessary to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novella, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also include &quot;hidden text&quot; to encourage deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a Leaving Certificate in the language and will be encouraged to choose English Literature as an elective.
The Ministry of Education is due to release new syllabuses for English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other essential subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate move, Ofqual, which oversees leaving-leaving exams, will unveil changes to the structure of the leaving-leaving exam, along with a new marking system and fewer projects for students.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was &quot;broad consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society&quot; and that there was a need to make the Leaving Certificate &quot;more challenging , more ambitious and stricter&quot;.
The study shows that English schools spend less time on maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
By comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on mathematics, and in Singapore about 138.
While there will be no official requirement to spend more time on maths, coalition sources said a comprehensive maths leaving exam - along with more emphasis on the subject in results tables - is likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on &quot;real world problems&quot;, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the ČSSD
Before the elections, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava ČSSD flared up.
Everything culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court because of the undemocratic selection of female candidates.
Still, the actors in the case did not want to comment too much on it, so as not to damage the party even more before the elections.
But now the voters&#39; votes have been counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD immediately on Monday evening called on the mayor of Ostrava to resign from the party, and will probably press for him to lose his position.
But Petr Kajnar wants to fight on.
He described what the disputes are about and who is on whose side in an exclusive interview for Deník.
How do you perceive the election result?
ČSSD certainly expected a much better result.
Did the fact that disputes within the party were resolved in the media before the elections harmed it in our country?
I can imagine that Social Democracy could have a better electoral result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the ČSSD is now.
It is a party that has its own internal problems, is internally sick, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the ČSSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through a decline for some time now, and unfortunately similar things are happening now in the social democracy.
It is the case that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends with the ODS, have moved to the people in the ČSSD and have influence over them.
It is related to the fact that the police go around the offices of the Ostrava municipality and collect computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not only composed of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps even in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between Haskovci and Sobotkovci.
But even that had been in preparation for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.
Hašek&#39;s wing gradually occupied positions so that after the elections it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotko&#39;s wing.
In politics, you are in a situation where you sometimes have to make compromises.
However, everyone has an inner limit where they can no longer make compromises, and this is also my case.
Originally, I did not want to run for the House of Representatives, but when I perceived the whole thing within the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get on the regional candidate list in order to strengthen Sobotko&#39;s wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hašek&#39;s wing put a stop to it.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
In my opinion, Slávek Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to a certain extent, about the visions for the party and for this country.
I confess that I have not heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I don&#39;t understand how the presidency, which is a lower body than the central executive committee, can just start removing the party chairman.
This is a power struggle regardless of everything and against the party constitution.
In my opinion, with what Michal Hašek has now demonstrated in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How did you perceive the fact that the Ostrava ČSSD leadership did not approve you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on the competition of who among their members ranks where.
That competition should be based for the most part on program visions and on the abilities of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have much ability or vision also apply for this competition, but for them the political party is an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore by unscrupulously breaking the rules, breaking the party constitution.
With their practices, they are turning political parties into mafias, and in my opinion, they are also violating the laws of the Czech Republic.
Highlighting this issue is more important to me than considering whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, you filed a motion with the court for a preliminary measure against the appearance of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by being able to cancel organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establish new organizations, and gradually expel inconvenient party members.
An example is the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they preferred to cancel the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party statutes through the courts is indeed the last option, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the ČSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The Ostrava ČSSD leadership, led by MP Adam Rykala, is trying to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumir Palyza, has a crush on this post.
That&#39;s right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything in order to recall me.
They promise people positions, get votes, and then consolidate their power in the party for those votes.
If I go back to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could label me as someone who puts money where it doesn&#39;t belong.
At the same time, the city bought property that has great strategic value for it.
So how do you see it going forward with your remaining in the position of mayor?
The district committee already invited me and other people on Monday to consider staying in the ČSSD.
But I think it is like a thief shouting: Catch the thief!
If we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I don&#39;t see anyone in the Ostrava Social Democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes even against party members, the creation of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Still, everything makes me uncomfortable.
I don&#39;t read it as anything other than preventing others from making their way to the places they desire.
Will you still fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, the political parties must also function well.
It is hard for me to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state when it cannot even manage itself.
So I don&#39;t think that I would leave the ČSSD now, because I think that the one who is causing this party&#39;s cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to piss me off.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It&#39;s a bit of a paradox.
While his team has not been doing well in terms of results recently, Viktoria Plzeň&#39;s defender or midfielder František Rajtoral has the form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He also succeeds in shooting, he is very active, after an intervention he was awarded a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice, but in the end took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant streak in the match against Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
&quot;I believe that we will beat Jablonec at home,&quot; promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match against North Bohemia, who play attacking football.
Everything is aimed at the match with Jablonec, the coach is preparing us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent&#39;s game.
&quot;I believe that it will be an excellent match on Friday night,&quot; the Czech national team player invites fans to the stands of the Doosan Arena.
Pilsen&#39;s last matches did not turn out the way she would have liked, but the Viktoria defender rejects the word crisis.
That&#39;s how it goes in football, sometimes you&#39;re in good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn&#39;t talk about the crisis in any case.
&quot;I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again,&quot; says the defender of West Bohemia.
The Viktoria team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
&quot;It&#39;s played on Friday night and I&#39;d like to invite our fans, who are great.
&quot;I believe we will repay them with a win,&quot; adds Rajtoral.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to both Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on students, pedagogues and management of secondary schools and universities in several regions with open letters to defend academic freedom against the election campaign that President Miloš Zeman was conducting in schools.
I met with more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary chairman of SPOZ - Zemanovec in the pre-election period, was even retaliated against in the form of not being invited to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were not so brave and made Miloš Zeman&#39;s visit possible: University of Technology in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, JE Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice we encounter the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
Newly elected deputy for ODS, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it&#39;s really not the same as if you stayed in the position of mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the ČSSD governors who forge the position of deputy and governor at the same time and, like them, degrade both professions?
This is because you are telling people that both of these demanding functions can be handled with the left rear.
I know, we have the example of Michal Hašek here, who manages even several dozen functions at once.
But that&#39;s probably not exactly an example of a person you should follow.
We also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who preferred to leave the post of deputy in order to devote herself fully to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the position of dean is that you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the Pardubice ODS sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help &quot;your&quot; school even without remaining a dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion to that of me and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and save face.
Otherwise, it may happen that the voters will do the math for you in the next election.
And that doesn&#39;t have to last long.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States sometimes went &quot;too far&quot; in spying, according to AFP, the head of US diplomacy, John Kerry, admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, the collection of information served to avert terrorist attacks.
According to AFP, the &quot;first confession from Washington&quot; was made amid fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic due to scandalous revelations about mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which also targeted US allies.
&quot;In some cases, I admit, just as the president (Barack Obama) has done, some of these actions have gone too far, and we assure you that will not happen in the future,&quot; Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the current practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as the attacks of September 11, 2001 in the USA, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005.
&quot;We have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to be informed of plots in time,&quot; Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information &quot;went unreasonably far in some cases&quot;.
The scandal surrounding US intelligence, which allegedly monitored hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s mobile phone.
European leaders did not hide their indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prevent or significantly limit the surveillance.
The royal commission has heard that two staff members of the Young Men&#39;s Christian Association (YMCA) were accused before the charges against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has heard that before charges were laid against Caringbah child educator Jonathan Lord in 2011, two New South Wales Young Men&#39;s Christian Association (YMCA) staff were accused of child sexual abuse.
But it was heard before the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association said that they had never dealt with a case of child sexual abuse in their organization.
Chief executive Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA staff member was charged with child pornography offenses and another in which a Caringbah YMCA trainer was convicted in 1991 of sexually abusing children in his care .
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, an adviser to the commission, that he knew about the first case but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA&#39;s initial statement was also inaccurate when it said there had been external audits of the YMCA that recognized the organization as a leading advocate for children&#39;s rights.
Evidence presented by the commission said the YMCA was made aware that it had received the second-lowest of four possible ratings in a Department for Education and Society audit in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted management from himself down failed to take Mr Lord on without making sure staff were aware of their duty to report breaches of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys during a two-year stint at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected claims the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Mr Lord&#39;s breach of child safety.
Staff members gave evidence that they witnessed such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, privately watching them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cellphone by phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord&#39;s subordinate and requested child safety training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of children&#39;s services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord&#39;s supervisor, was &quot;very intimidating and often hard to talk to him about anything&quot;.
The CEO said he did not accept staff&#39;s evidence that they felt uncomfortable contacting their superiors to report the incidents.
Instead, he said their friendship with Lorde clouded their judgment and that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t report the problem.
Mr Hare said he told the New South Wales YMCA board his view that the lesson for the organization from the &quot;Jonathan Lord case&quot; was that staff &quot;didn&#39;t report back&quot;, and the board agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign non-disclosure agreements was made by the YMCA&#39;s general manager of children&#39;s services, Liam Whitley, shortly after the allegations emerged.
He said the aim was to avoid tampering with evidence but was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly executed.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission the NSW YMCA was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems with recruitment, screening, onboarding, training and management of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: The new green economy should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuous decrease in the volume of orders and the state&#39;s lack of interest in solving the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens, who will save considerable amounts of money on heating after the implementation of the measures, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government&#39;s resolution and requests the implementation of such steps that would allow the program to continue, so that further calls could be announced within it.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use tech on planes (but not make calls from their cell phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices &quot;gate-to-gate&quot; — in addition to making calls from their cellphones — to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music under eagerly awaited new rules issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA ).
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA that their airplanes comply with the new rules and that they have updated cabin crew training manuals and equipment stowage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
&quot;Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 3 kilometers and the captain gives permission.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane is descending to land and not to turn them back on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose planes are properly shielded against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
&quot;Once the new rules are safely in place - and we will be working closely with the transport companies on this - it will be a success,&quot; Glading said in a statement.
Frankly speaking, we are getting tired of looking like &quot;watchmen&quot;.
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and SMS or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
So still no Words with friends, the online scrabble game actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously kicked off an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off his device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops will still have to be stored due to concerns they could injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for cell phone use are not set by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Commission.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Board, an expert on national transportation safety for CBS News, said cellphones continue to be considered a risk.
&quot;Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference to transmission towers in the air,&quot; Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study the issue suggested last month that the government allow the electronic devices to be used more widely.
The FAA has come under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, say there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of such devices becomes ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technological achievement of the time.
The new airliners are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generation aircraft, but they are also engineered and approved by the FAA to be immune to electronic interference.
Airlines have offered Wi-Fi to passengers at cruising altitudes for several years.
Plans tailored for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Today&#39;s electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio emissions than devices of previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal emissions when turning a page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Among those pushing to loosen restrictions on passenger use of these devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded an airliner with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA&#39;s advisory board expressed mixed feelings about whether the devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off their devices during low-visibility instrument flying.
A travel industry group has welcomed the changes, saying they are a sensible move for the traveling public, who make heavy use of technology.
&quot;We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience does not conflict with safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
In unprecedented admission, John Kerry says US spying &#39;has gone too far&#39;
John Kerry has signaled a softening of the US defense stance on its surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases the spying has &quot;gone too far&quot;.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting on &quot;autopilot&quot; in the face of damning revelations about the NSA&#39;s spying activities that emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The leaked information sparked a diplomatic firestorm between the US government and its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There&#39;s no doubt that the president and I and others in the government have really learned about some of the things that have been happening out of inertia because the possibility was there, referring to to World War II, the difficult period of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.&quot;
He thus became the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that US spying had crossed a line, but stressed that no one&#39;s rights had been violated.
He said: &quot;In some cases it has gone too far.&quot;
And the president is determined to try to explain it to the people and make it clear, and he&#39;s already doing a thorough review so that nobody feels there&#39;s been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
But Mr Kerry insisted that the NSA was for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: &quot;We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot;
There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent on murdering and blowing people up and attacking governments.
What if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We&#39;ve actually prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed because we know about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate European Affairs Subcommittee said Thursday that US lawmakers are heading to Europe to address concerns from abroad about alleged US espionage and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joining forces in the fight against terrorism.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned by their threats to end participation in counterterrorism organizations because they are disillusioned with National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance.
&quot;It&#39;s really important to US national security interests that Europe stays in the same boat with us in terms of joint efforts to fight terrorism,&quot; Murphy, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington. .
And I&#39;m heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, even though the agency&#39;s head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States.
Another revelation cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had been monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s cell phone and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spying by allies as necessary and said it was commonplace on both sides.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year and hopes to include members of both parties and chambers in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to participate are to be announced.
He said the program is still a work in progress.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help mend relationships, he added that &quot;well-intentioned educational measures&quot; would also be in place.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spying programs they themselves have used for years.
&quot;While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize that we are not the only ones doing espionage here,&quot; Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the animosity already sparked by US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance.
The words &quot;Mugabe is a lame donkey&quot; are no longer punishable by prison, the court annulled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be very careful about how they speak in public about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and has been its leader since the end of 1987.
According to Section 33 of the Penal Code, insulting the presidency was punishable by a fine of $100 and up to one year in prison.
&quot;State prosecutors should not eagerly accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places,&quot; said the representatives of the Constitutional Court.
The nine justices unanimously agreed that the law undermined freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court&#39;s decision, the British BBC reported.
A number of aggrieved Zimbabweans spoke out against the law, including Tendai Danga, who the police arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during an argument with a policeman in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist who insulted Mugabe in public by insulting him as &quot;lame donkey&quot; ended up in prison.
Then in August, a prosecutor charged the 26-year-old man over his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe&#39;s face as toilet paper.
The court also declared the law restricting media freedom unconstitutional.
&quot;The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false,&quot; Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwean law allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years in prison.
&quot;The existence of a law that makes it possible to criminalize someone for making a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to free expression,&quot; Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a heavy hand for more than 33 years, in March Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties in a referendum.
The country took small steps away from a one-man dictatorship in 2009, when a deal between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the prime minister&#39;s seat.
Nevertheless, the country continues to be plagued by an economic crisis and, until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, in Zimbabwe, payments are made only in currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is taking its toll on Mugabe&#39;s ill-advised agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers between his supporters and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with running farms.
The young couple has matured to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the plot itself slightly sloping.
The requirement further stated that two generations would live in the house, who would like to live together, but at the same time each should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping lot.
The architects therefore decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
&quot;When creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place.&quot;
&quot;The three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy,&quot; the designers explain.
The parents&#39; home is at the level of the garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, as they differ in the different final finishing of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using plank panels, the part where the office is is plastered in white and the remaining elements have remained in a pure concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very much connected with the exterior.
The parents&#39; home, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance to the family.
The connection between the interior and the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house through the main hall entrance and from there climbs the stairs to their quarters.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is what the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and give it something unique.
The young couple&#39;s household is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with a sliding door.
A living area with a dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which flows freely onto the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is designed in a clean combination of white and black.
The staircase is a dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds itself in the entrance hall and from there climbs the stairs upwards.
Firefighters came to rescue a lost puppy stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Ruby the cocker spaniel ran away after a minor car accident.
Three days later, he was spotted trapped in a quarry by a person walking a dog.
Firefighters rappelled down the rock face to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire crews who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous ledge in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a minor car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived on her own for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and to thank West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away when he got into a minor accident, they frantically searched for their lost dog and posted appeals on social media.
On Wednesday at about 2:15 p.m., a sharp-sighted dog handler spotted Ruby stuck on a ledge in the quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to lift him up the rock.
Andy Clayton, specialist technical rescue team leader, said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
He was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
He didn&#39;t bat an eyelash during the rescue - he was completely frozen.
But he&#39;s fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual outing.
The fact that someone spotted the dog is unbelievable.
Expert technical rescue team leader Peter Lau said: &quot;Ruby was very lucky during his escape.&quot;
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and other than being exhausted and dehydrated, he was fine.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;I was scared to see the rescue operation.&quot;
Above all, I couldn&#39;t believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The vet said if he got too exhausted and collapsed he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: &quot;We were worried he might fall but he stayed there.&quot;
The firefighters were great.
We just still don&#39;t understand how he got there.
A cooling tower burned down in the industrial complex of ČKD in Prague during the night
In the industrial area of ČKD in Prague, a large-capacity storage tank was on fire, according to the firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
&quot;Firefighters went to the fire on Thursday before eleven o&#39;clock in the evening, and this morning they were still putting out the fire,&quot; announced Pavlína Adamcová, spokeswoman for the Prague fire department.
According to measurements, the amount of pollutants in the air in the surroundings did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the premises in Kolbenova Street.
&quot;This is a fire in a large-capacity storage tank, probably a cooling tower,&quot; said Adamcová.
&quot;There is no functional fire hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing with the help of transport lines from tankers,&quot; she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing was complicated by a malfunctioning network of fire hydrants, so the firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The commander of the fire brigade declared the second level of fire alarm.
There are four levels in total, the fourth is declared in the most serious situations.
Chemists also went to the site to check the level of hazardous substances that could have been released into the air during the fire.
&quot;However, they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygienic standards,&quot; said the spokeswoman for the fire department.
A $325 million bailout for Tasmanian health
The Federal Government is insisting a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania&#39;s moribund health service contains tough conditions to ensure the state government does not squander the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced the Australian Union was taking &quot;fast-track action&quot; to avert a crisis caused by the island&#39;s aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic disruption.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultation with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
&quot;The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems the state is facing,&quot; Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for patient-requested surgeries.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract operations, will help clear the debt.
The money is also for open access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
&quot;These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian health system,&quot; Ms Plibersek said.
The Minister emphasized that the Tasmanian Government must require a strict reporting regime and record keeping obligations.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels to receive the Australian Union money and report monthly where the additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would be of no use &quot;until there is genuine reform to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania&#39;s public health system&quot;.
Still, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first raised during a meeting with the prime minister in early May.
&quot;I believe that the federal relief package can get the state&#39;s public health system out of a critical state,&quot; Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elective procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today&#39;s announcement is just a &quot;band-aid&quot;.
&quot;The reason I&#39;m here is because the Labor government has taken $430 million out of our health system,&quot; he told ABC TV.
You can&#39;t have a state government taking almost half a billion dollars and the Australian Federation giving $300 million and pretend it&#39;s good news.
Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout was spent on senior bureaucracy.
There is music playing in the Műstek subway
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) of Prague launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during subway operation, is the Bridge of line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The trial run will last six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos, they are supposed to ease the tension
Police specialists should work in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They would spend up to half of their errands here.
They would keep order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing the tension between people from slums and residents from the surrounding area.
The Ministry of the Interior takes this into account in its proposal to reduce security risks.
According to him, &quot;accelerated provision of social housing&quot; would mainly help to improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
80,000 people lived in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were jobless, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in &quot;special&quot; schools.
Usury was rampant.
According to experts, problem locations have increased by a hundred in the meantime.
Relations between their inhabitants and others become strained.
Anti-Roma marches were held in several places.
People from the neighborhood also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
A fundamental condition is said to be &quot;consistent application of an equal approach in law enforcement&quot;.
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without detailed knowledge of the place and people.
The specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest he would serve in his district.
He would oversee order in a troubled locality.
He would also know the locals, so he would be better able to solve problems or offenses.
&quot;Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of illegal actions,&quot; the insider said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive additional payments of 500 to 1,000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be paid for from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being worked out.
The project should last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
&quot;There are so-called Roma settlements,&quot; the authors of the report said.
It is not yet clear how many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic.
The answer is to be given by an analysis that will determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release for these members every year after the end of the project.
According to the project proposal, the selected police officers will first complete an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should go through this training every year.
The most suitable candidates will emerge from them.
There should also be special training for police officers who will work in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
They say it should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the ideas of the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
Medium standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social apartments, which would be comparable to regular housing, would have a higher standard.
Tenants would have to fulfill an integration plan that social workers would draw up with them.
They would have to comply with the housing regulations, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of living.
According to the interior, the transitional housing system should work for at least 30 years, until the next generation grows up &quot;in a pro-integration motivated environment&quot;.
The social housing model is being prepared by the departments for local development and works.
They have until the end of the year to propose it.
Together with Bárta, the inspectorate also arrested an anti-corruption police analyst
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was reported by the Prvnízpravy.cz server.
MF DNES soon found out that the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS) had taken charge of the case, its people were supposed to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where police officers are among the accused, but its authority also extends to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the anti-corruption police officers - head of analytics and IT, Jan Petržílek - is among those arrested.
He previously worked for the Security Information Service.
However, the spokesman of the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, refused to comment on the information, adding that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokesperson for the inspection, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, and immediately referred the case to the Municipal Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Prague.
&quot;We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information,&quot; said representative representative Štěpánka Zenklová.
Also, from this non-specific response, it can be inferred that the event took place, but is in secrecy mode, which does not allow the speakers to say anything concrete.
Bárt&#39;s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represents Bárta &quot;in this matter as well&quot;, but given that it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bárta&#39;s arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bárt&#39;s arrest could be related to former police chief Petr Lessy.
It was Bárta who pushed him to the position together with the former chairman of the VV Radek John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that flared up because of this between former Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV even had to be resolved by the then President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from on my person.
No one contacted me, I was not questioned.
&quot;I really don&#39;t know anything about the matter,&quot; Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became Chief of Police.
It was officially promoted by Radek John, but the real head of the party was Bárta at the time.
Bárta now ran in the elections for the Úsvit movement, he narrowly missed out on the parliamentary mandate - by 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn, Tomio Okamura, stated that he had no idea what this was all about.
&quot;Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate list, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of Tomio Okamura&#39;s Dawn of Direct Democracy,&quot; he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who said before the elections that he had given Bárta room to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the executors.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former party colleague from VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign workers with visa authorization may be subject to an &quot;eligibility&quot; test
As the government looks to expand police crackdowns, it is considering an &quot;eligibility&quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
When a government discussion paper was released today, former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government&#39;s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia&#39;s neighbours.
&quot;The slogans of &#39;foreigners last&#39; and &#39;jobs first for Australians&#39; are a very unpleasant holdover from the days when unions demanded a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor was to be protected - and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if anyone in the region has heard echoes of this historical artifact.
The discussion article breaks down 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O&#39;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials over people-smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, with the rest remaining to be considered.
If the &quot;eligibility&quot; criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be scrutinized to see if &quot;nomination is eligible where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business.&quot;
Following previous experience with businesses intending to sponsor a small number of workers but then employing hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat in Christmas Island this week.
The man&#39;s terrified nine-year-old son traveled to Australia with him and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat after his father&#39;s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
Israeli warplanes attacked a target in Syria, the official said
Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The official in charge did not say specifically what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the targets were Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria at least twice before this year.
She moved from the villa to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague&#39;s nicest residential neighborhoods, Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance pay.
Ivana therefore quickly looked for alternative housing for herself and her then elderly mother.
She got a tip from friends about a 3 + kk apartment in an older block of flats on the opposite side of Prague.
&quot;At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the extensive forest park and the dam on the other side excited me,&quot; recalls Ivana of her first impression.
At first, I thought it would be temporary for three years.
&quot;Today, we have lived here for more than thirteen years, and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I wouldn&#39;t change,&quot; adds the owner.
At the time, mother and daughter were moving from a one hundred and twenty square meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in fairly good condition, but the necessary modifications had to be made, for example painting the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hall, and on the contrary, the small bathroom.
Combining two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and divide the room, which enabled the new placement of lights.
The first intervention, which she decided to do after a few years, was the removal of the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery opened up.
The next step to partially improve the standard was replacing the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn&#39;t know how to deal with the bathroom.
For years I subscribed to housing magazines and looked for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So, on the recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
&quot;It was actually the most important step for the future,&quot; says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the layout of the hall.
The architect combined the WC and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with opening wings with sliding ones, thereby saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, there is also a comfortable seat in the shower, and a bidet shower near the toilet.
The successful collaboration with Kamila Douděrová continued.
As part of the program How a dream is built, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also took part.
We had to fit three functions into the space, which was created by joining two smaller rooms, dining, living and sleeping, without using the classic principles of optical division, for example half partitions or Japanese walls.
&quot;This would ultimately violate the openness and uniformity of the space,&quot; explains the architect.
It was possible to separate the sleeping and living areas in an original way.
It was enough to turn two sofas with their backs to each other and place a custom-made duvet cabinet between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and painting.
The architect used high-quality marmoleum for the floor in the kitchen and dining area, and enlivened the sliding doors with patterned wallpaper.
If necessary, sliding panels with wallpaper cover the kitchen corner.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marmole has a number of advantages compared to the previous one made of laminate: a softer, non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and soffits made of plasterboard highlighted with color is an example of how you can work with space in a block of flats.
I left the colors to the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
&quot;I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment,&quot; says Ivana.
Graphite glass cladding with a blossoming magnolia motif is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
For a warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern, functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are conveniently controlled remotely.
In the remodeled interior, the contrast between the new and the old works very well, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier and high-quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
Last came the kitchen.
The cupboards used to be placed on both sides and the owner felt a bit like she was in a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and rearranged the layout.
The furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface is softened by a slightly pearlescent surface.
Thanks to an imaginative solution, a washing machine, dryer and dishwasher fit into a small space.
The appearance of the small kitchen was enlivened by the all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
The unique graphic glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is also very easy to maintain.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
The original bathroom had a small bathtub and a sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower has Ronal glass doors.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the given environment, in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
We unified the interior in terms of materials and colors and tried to give it an elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
&quot;Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of daily necessities,&quot; adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát restored the position of Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
&quot;I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary,&quot; explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I respect the work of nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention by the Ministry.
In the performance of this profession, not only high professional professionalism is needed, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
&quot;I will gladly and with all responsibility try to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses.&quot;
&quot;We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare sector, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients, to perform their profession with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public,&quot; says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated on the occasion of her inauguration that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nurse&#39;s job position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
&quot;Fundamentally, I do not want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, while each has their own competences and, together with other health workers, they form a coordinated work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.&quot;
&quot;I myself encounter a number of problems that occur when performing the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution.&quot;
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
&quot;I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks unnecessarily burden nurses and take away their time, which they could and should rather devote to patients,&quot; says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas on which he intends to focus include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve mutual cooperation in the team and with the management of health service providers, adjusting competencies and also labor law issues, such as compliance with the labor code or not overburdening nurses with their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, but for fear of possible punishment, they are not documented in a specific case where the rules could be violated.
&quot;Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the function of the Chief Nurse of the CR could in this case serve as a guarantee of preserving the anonymity of such a complaint and let the relevant authorities examine the specific case,&quot; concludes Alena Šmídová.
M.Sc. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary School of Nursing in the field of Nursing (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been working as the head of the department of nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health.
In the course of her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal department, and also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009, she worked as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and has been engaged in lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denis Diderot&#39;s novella, which brings an exceptional cinematic setting and portrayal of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in 1860s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally depraved mother superior and becomes the object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slips into lasciviousness or sensationalism, and that&#39;s its problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to the fact that even the audience will experience an agony similar to wearing a linen shirt.
Jana Péťová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it&#39;s not actually a step at all, but a big leap - a leap back several years, into memories, into my childhood.
It&#39;s a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and do the dishes and clean up and do homework.
Although these &quot;obligations&quot; were mostly just theories, wishes of the parents.
Practice was completely different - run from school, throw the bag in the corner and run outside.
Play ball games with other children, jump shots.
Then, during the series Helena and her boys, embroider a festive tablecloth for grandma&#39;s birthday with chain stitch.
And only then, after the umpteenth warning, do you finally wash the dishes, delux, put wood in the tiled stove in the winter and do your homework under the lamp until after dark (or rely on a classmate and write amorous verses addressed to your school crush instead of homework).
In the morning, to have homemade strawberry jam for breakfast (made from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which did not even lie next to strawberries) and drink it with tea made from dried herbs that my mother and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was grave silence in the little room, when my sister and I recorded songs from the radio on tapes, which played loudly in the old cassette player left by mom.
And then we would rewind the tapes on a pencil and play the same song over and over again, our favorite, and drink a siphon.
Or we used to talk on the phone across the table with the help of cans that were tied together with a string - and speaking of phone calls, in order to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the earplugs at that time were matches + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it so that we didn&#39;t lack for anything.
We didn&#39;t need any iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
The clothes were passed down from generation to generation, and the best &quot;addition&quot; to the wardrobe was a batik T-shirt made at home with the help of SAVA.
In terms of electronics, our mother&#39;s cassette player was enough to satisfy us, and at most the Walkman, which we shared with my sister and which, by the way, we only used on the train on a school trip anyway.
We thought it was more interesting to play Hop the Hat or Man, don&#39;t be angry with aunt, or, as I already mentioned, to &quot;just&quot; go out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, my parents probably saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately it didn&#39;t warm up for a long time.
My younger sister poured strudel into it, she said that it chewed the cassettes so well, so she tried to see if the strudel could also be eaten.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this incident on his father&#39;s plate, poor thing.
She says that when Lenka was little, she made a strudel in a video and thought that she would play the recipe and it didn&#39;t, which is why she still can&#39;t bake it to this day.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, agree without a mobile phone or computer.
Together with my sister, we agreed with the neighbor&#39;s granddaughter on vacation at grandma&#39;s that we would meet again next summer at grandma&#39;s - and that&#39;s how it was, that&#39;s how it was.
We got together.
Make a promise to someone now that you&#39;ll see each other in a year?!
I also remember the winter, when we ran outside with the whole village, built snowmen, rode on the snowy hill near the church on sacks stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner together with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard the notorious phrase before every dinner: &quot;Go wash your hands!&quot;
Yes, this is still true today, but you certainly don&#39;t have lemon netted soap tied to the faucet in your bathroom.
After dinner, when dad &quot;worked&quot; in the garage with a beer with Jarda from the village, mom and I lay down on the floor, put our feet on the stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackling of the wood that flowed from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn&#39;t count how many friends we had on a social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn&#39;t write messages daily through various chats, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew far more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It&#39;s nice to remember, especially if I supplement those memories by looking through albums where black and white photos are neatly pasted with black corners.
And in case I didn&#39;t know how old I was at the time, the year the picture was taken is always written on the back of the photo.
I see that even though the haircuts didn&#39;t suit us very well and we had pants two sizes bigger than our cousin&#39;s, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I&#39;d rather go back that step forward - to reality.
Until 2013 and I&#39;ll wait to see what modern times will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now at least &quot;a hundred years behind the monkeys&quot; for the young teenage generation, and I think they are missing out on a lot, that they will not experience this &quot;pre-ape&quot; time either.
I wish them that!
Young Czechs know that they must save.
But most of them have no idea with what interest
More and more Czechs are saving money.
However, they do not reach the savings champions in the region.
Austrians save the most money, saving an average of 181 euros per month.
People in Slovakia also save a little more than the Czechs.
This follows from a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving and two-thirds of those surveyed plan to put more money away.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, people in Romania and Serbia still use very little savings products.
For example, according to the survey, almost every second Serb saves money &quot;under the pillow&quot; at home.
In the country, the number of those who save higher amounts each month has increased this year.
As recently as last year, 26 percent of respondents saved between 1,000 and 2,500 crowns every month for various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit fell slightly to 2,078 crowns in a year-on-year comparison.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is decreasing, compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
Only 16 percent of respondents already use them, while last year it was almost a quarter of people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they achieve on individual products.
Above all, young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money earns interest.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents have the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money, among people over fifty years of age, 73 percent of the respondents know this.
In an international comparison of the Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12 percent gap.
An Australian woman has appealed her stay in a Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in jail on the island of Phuket after she falsely claimed she was assaulted by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially charged by the Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 with false accusation when she told Thai police that the taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly held her up, assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before admitting she had fabricated the story.
She was held in a local police cell before her trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult women&#39;s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who sought help from the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra in his daughter&#39;s case.
Tunks told Sydney&#39;s Sunday Telegraph that the family were &quot;extremely concerned&quot; for their daughter&#39;s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
&quot;Obviously it&#39;s a difficult time, but we&#39;re hopeful that he&#39;ll come back to us safely as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the sentence and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
Reports from Australia say she has since been holidaying in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was said to have been warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to repair its tarnished image for tourists, which may have been behind the acquittal.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
Lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Municipal Social House in Cologne not only his brand new double-CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the Mezi námi program singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml, accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benek Orchestra.
After an introductory intro and an actor&#39;s etude about a delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in hand and thus recalled the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theater and the electricity went out in the whole city.
&quot;Otherwise, they produced two types of cards in Cologne, with which I came into contact a lot,&quot; he recalled.
He also reminded President Zeman&#39;s native.
&quot;Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravac near Bratislava,&quot; he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times during the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and when he was not speaking, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched on his new musical venture.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but at that time he had no idea about ice hockey, how we gather in those squares and chant that whoever does not jump is not a Czech.
That&#39;s also the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won&#39;t play it here today,&quot; he joked.
But Ondra Ruml sang from this album, which is said to be very suitable for him, Sleep in the Day, Sing at Night, and he accompanied himself on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he wasn&#39;t singing, he was playing percussion, and all three singers were accompanied by a band consisting of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists together sang a little dance song Do strání srdce sesá, which immediately stirred up the audience.
&quot;I&#39;m glad that you liked the song, which didn&#39;t surprise me in Kmoch&#39;s city,&quot; Michal Horáček responded afterwards.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, Rozezznam performed by František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, was rewarded with huge applause, and Hana Hegerová was reminded of the composition Tá ta ve rad Lída Baarová with Horáček&#39;s explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baarová with the American actress Mae West.
The composition Sebastián reminded the composer Michael Kocáb, and Segrado then sang the beautiful composition Praha set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zámuck and former Kolínák.
But that was the end, a standing ovation and an encore in the form of the optimistic composition We Live in a Wonderful Time.
There was one more encore on the playlist, but the fans didn&#39;t applaud it anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the foursome sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also older CDs, Michal Horáček&#39;s books and even the cover of the legendary LP and took pictures with any interested parties.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that he is postponing the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of Contracts of difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give the shareholder a recommendation, and not hide behind it.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave scheme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave scheme because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax assessment, made the claim as he sought to brush off the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer&#39;s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which will play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott&#39;s daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
&quot;He&#39;s put himself in a huge conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of his daughters get pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether they get paid parental leave,&quot; Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax after a recount of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott&#39;s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls close?
&quot;We have to have a better system,&quot; he said.
Why can&#39;t we have a system where you can come in, type the details into a computer, vote immediately and have the results at half past six in the evening?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballot papers.
The point is that the results can be erased if someone doesn&#39;t like them?
In this day and age, the use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda extended to the Sunshine Coast airport and he would take his new job &quot;very seriously&quot;.
Public office is a public service.
&quot;We seek no reward other than to serve society at this critical time,&quot; he said.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six companies out of ten are intensively preparing for the impending effect of the new Civil Code and the Act on Business Corporations from January 1, 2014.
Only eight percent of the interviewed company representatives said that they did not deal with matters related to both key codes in their company at all.
This follows from a survey by the law firm Ambruz &amp; Dark Deloitte Legal, which ascertained the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In connection with the approaching effective date of both key codes, it is only now at the last minute that many managers are beginning to realize what a significant influence they can have on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to the maneuvering of politicians, the business sector lived in uncertainty for a long time, whether revolutionary changes would eventually happen or not.
&quot;Now, however, they only have a few weeks left so that the transition to the new law can take place for their companies without complications,&quot; commented Ambruz &amp; Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spáčil on the results.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively dealing with the new codes, 26 percent said their companies have already taken all the necessary steps to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of companies from this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the other hand, every fifth company has not yet dealt with recodifications, but still has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet dealt with issues related to recodifications.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code for the largest number of surveyed companies is the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business terms and conditions (16 percent) and then changes in the real estate cadastre and liability for damage (ten percent each).
With contracts, one of the most significant innovations of the entire recodification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil Code and the Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
&quot;In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom in the arrangement of relationships,&quot; pointed out attorney Ambruz &amp; Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš Poddaný.
In connection with the Law on Business Corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
This is followed by topics related to changes in convening and conducting the general meeting (15 percent) and company representation (14 percent).
The new legislation means stricter obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where the company is at risk of bankruptcy or going into bankruptcy.
&quot;In practice, this means that if the members of the board of directors and company executives do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit obtained for the performance of the function for the last two years,&quot; added Spáčil.
The NSA revelations heighten societal paranoia about state surveillance
On a quiet day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the American consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&#39;s economic capital.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&#39;s domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of a US outpost located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and the action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, insisted again in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot;
But since collaborator-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden began to reveal his valuable collection of secret US surveillance, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know whether to trust the director&#39;s words.
Public paranoia about state surveillance has reached new heights following reports that the US National Security Agency spied on a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo.
The final straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone may have been tapped for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be a target, then surely leading businessmen are also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intense cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
&quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the US now poses as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consultancy EY.
But so far there is no evidence in the entire dossier revealed by Mr. Snowden that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign firms to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and said it should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical about it.
Voices are coming from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
That&#39;s not the way to go, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scope and technical sophistication of US spy agencies revealed by Snowden is still shocking to some companies, which until now believed that China posed the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a major shift in cloud computing where European officials have become increasingly aware that data stored in the US falls under US jurisdiction and is therefore potentially subject to attack.
About 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after the US Prism data-mining program was exposed, according to a survey by the Cloud security alliance.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP&#39;s CEOs, says: &quot;We have this new question for customers that wasn&#39;t there a year ago - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?&quot;
Many senior German officials argue that the latest news is just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is carried out is no surprise.
It always happened.
&quot;It&#39;s been a fundamental topic for many years and it hasn&#39;t changed significantly even during the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we spy on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally don&#39;t want to brag about the countermeasures they&#39;ve taken, lest they give an attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been reminded that taking a free USB memory stick to a trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Audi board member Ulrich Hackenberg says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings to prevent them from being used as eavesdropping devices.
Germany&#39;s BfV advises executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the risk that smartphones can be stolen.
Prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that SMEs will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific fields.
&quot;SMEs often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect company secrets against unauthorized access,&quot; the BfV warns in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, US National Intelligence Estimates in February listed France as the second-ranked perpetrator behind China in hacking economic news, alongside Russia and Israel.
A board member at a German risk-free company concluded that &quot;the French are the worst&quot; when it comes to economic espionage.
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France&#39;s domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: &quot;The services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.&quot;
A new nicotine vaccine may take the pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect a mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
More tests are needed and will take several years before human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says early signs are good.
&quot;We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have exhausted all the methods available on the market today, only to find that their nicotine addiction is so strong that it can overcome all current approaches,&quot; he said. Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice that were additionally given nicotine continued their normal activities.
But the mice that weren&#39;t vaccinated &quot;calmed down,&quot; the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had entered their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they have the urge to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
However, it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to quit.
&quot;They&#39;ll know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they won&#39;t get any benefit from it, and that will help them kick the habit,&quot; he said.
British researchers said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.
The desperate cry of an Obama voter
I voted for Obama twice - I shared the hope for possible change
He says Obama&#39;s sincere efforts were thwarted by GOP obstruction
Obstructive politics cannot excuse the woes of Obama&#39;s health care website or drone attacks
Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is in his second year studying medicine at Harvard.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would cheer me up and restore a glimmer of hope during the dark days of my second year of medical school.
It&#39;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and it&#39;s about memories of Barack Obama&#39;s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the patient reviews and go to bed in the evening, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide and the television coverage made us think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy and my parents were hiding the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the 2008 inauguration, Obama had an 82 percent approval rating.
And here I close the book.
Moving into the present is a rude awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It&#39;s hard to remember those optimistic days—they seem like distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, things have indeed changed.
It was definitely nothing like I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied accomplishments—from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the &quot;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstruction has derailed so many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, public health care options, and closing Guantánamo Bay, among others.
But after many times defending the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit as to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain consent to eavesdropping on foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the National Security Agency collecting data on the private lives of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who expose government wrongdoing.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper trial, or for limiting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the report&#39;s finding that the White House&#39;s efforts to silence the media are &quot;the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.&quot;
And most recently, they can&#39;t even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don&#39;t know if something like this could have been expected.
Whether I should have guessed at 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
Elected office obviously has no predictable course, and our public conversations will be shaped by the opposing political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all of the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration&#39;s own decision.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unpolished alternative and seemed unable to solidify his policies or position.
I had a feeling that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we once heard about.
Still, going back to 2008 -- with Obama&#39;s approval rating dipping below 45% this week -- is getting harder and harder through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week I read a chapter in a book about Obama&#39;s crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a follow-up meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he needed to get back on track and stay true to his mission.
&quot;I want our magic back,&quot; he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It&#39;s been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
ŠkoFIN&#39;s business and marketing is headed by Abrahámek
His competencies include the area of product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luďek Šantora in the position.
Abrahámek has spent the last 14 years of his professional career working with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last place of work was the company Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was established in 1992.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, watchdog says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as fierce fighting erupted in the country&#39;s north, not far from one of the sites believed to contain the poison.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 residents had been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1,
a deadline the Hague-based organization set for Damascus to destroy or disable all chemical weapons production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals to create poison gas and fill ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in the ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus&#39; chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
An activist group monitoring the overall death toll through the Syria Activist Network reported on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are supposed to be 29,954 members of Bashar Assad&#39;s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah.
The dead are also said to include 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict has forced about 2 million residents to flee the country.
Assad&#39;s forces have been fighting in Safirah against insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were casualties on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
The fighting has underscored the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors, who face tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal amid an ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was now &quot;satisfied to have verified - and monitored the destruction of - Syria&#39;s declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment&quot;.
He added that &quot;no further control activities are currently planned&quot;.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been &quot;abandoned and ... items of the chemical weapons program they contained were moved to two other declared sites that were inspected,&quot; according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of the sites OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW&#39;s executive committee next month.
&quot;I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission this organization has ever had,&quot; said Observer Director Ahmet Uzumcu in comments released by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war pits mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad&#39;s government and its security forces, which are filled with members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Ramí Abdul Rahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside an air defense facility in Syria&#39;s coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the blast was unknown.
Gazprom&#39;s Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria is ushering in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe&#39;s largest energy projects, Gazprom&#39;s director said.
&quot;Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia&#39;s gas to Europe, adds to the riskiness of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are &quot;forever&quot; removed.
Once the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is expected to begin in other countries downstream later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early Puberty: Matures earlier
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than their Caucasian peers.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is approaching
Hormones or other chemicals have not been proven to be responsible
Experts say one of the triggers for earlier puberty may be the obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not as evident in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children&#39;s health and family issues.
Should a mother be alarmed when her daughter starts growing breasts and pubic hair at age 7 or 8?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
&quot;I spent a lot of time reassuring parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid progress toward full puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor appear earlier in girls.
However, there has been little change in the age at which the first period occurs over the past forty years.
In the United States, the median age is now 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
&quot;Once breasts begin to develop, it&#39;s at least two to three years before the first period occurs,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of &quot;Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.&quot; : An essential guide to dealing with this common problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
What triggers the actual onset of puberty is debated, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8, the girl is considered &quot;precocious&quot;.
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be closely monitored by pediatricians.
Faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to run tests to rule out serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to stunting and stunting in adulthood.
Medication and hormone therapy recommendations are dependent on the child&#39;s age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to the use of medication, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that &quot;suppressing puberty can alleviate problems with a girl&#39;s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers.&quot;
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply don&#39;t want their very young daughters to menstruate.
&quot;They&#39;re worried that she might get pregnant or how she&#39;s going to handle hygiene,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not ready emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of precocious puberty.
However, there is not yet a consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - like girls - reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of 6- to 9-year-old girls linking body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their Caucasian counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another conundrum: Although boys begin to develop facial and pubic hair at an early age, the trend toward full bloom at early puberty is not as pronounced as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) conference added further complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
&quot;We have to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children&#39;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
&quot;It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you think,&quot; advised Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if it happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous region of Qalamoun.
According to increasingly detailed reports, Israel destroyed rockets intended for Hezbollah during airstrikes on two locations in western Syria on Wednesday.
This Lebanese Shiite organization fights in Syria on the side of the Syrian army.
Its program also includes the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has clearly said that it will prevent the transfer of weapons to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday&#39;s Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but American sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, missiles fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses where missiles were being prepared for shipment to Lebanon were hit.
According to its sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron Ben Yishai said Syria was continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force was training members of Hezbollah&#39;s armed wing to handle the missiles.
SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, their mobility and small size make them easy to hide.
They are equipped with a radar, but it turns off after the missile is fired, making them difficult to target.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
It claims to help protect Syria&#39;s Shia community, to which the Alawites belong.
Now, 15,000 of his fighters are said to be ready to help the army take back Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Qalamoun is located between Damascus and the country&#39;s third largest city, Homs.
According to al-Arabiya&#39;s source, the battle is to be a retaliation for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army win back the town of Qusayr near the Lebanese border this year.
Many rebels from Kusayr went to Kalamún.
In it, he claims that Maliki has a large share in the renewal of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly also the result of fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka is negotiating for the ČSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, people&#39;s people and old people are talking to each other and planning a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats come to their senses within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly matched partners who will put on the table a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts.
ČSSD deputies will either swallow the coalition&#39;s sour grapes or nod to the fickle minority government.
After four days of riding the wave of sympathy, Bohuslav Sobotka encountered for the first time.
Yesterday he failed to control the political body and, above all, to force the convicted liars to resign.
So far, he is the only confirmed negotiator for the party, other team members will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the board members and now to the citizens.
One should not lie, in personal life or in public.
&quot;It was a mistake,&quot; Michal Hašek said after the meeting of the closest leadership of the Social Democracy.
He added that he does not cling to the post of first vice president.
&quot;I will announce my decision on November 10 at the ÚVV,&quot; Hašek said.
Zdeněk Škromach, deputy chairman of the ČSSD, and head of the parliamentary club, Jeroným Tejc, spoke similarly.
However, he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
Both deputies then declared that they would do everything to ensure that the fifty-member ČSSD club sounded with one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theater with the sentence: &quot;I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of party bodies.&quot;
In other words, another live lie.
Or perhaps, when calling for Sobotka&#39;s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, he forgot that the August ÚVV voted by 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka is the party&#39;s candidate for prime minister?
However, by convening the ÚVV until next Sunday, the head of the ČSSD created a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of the 192 members of this body and the media with all kinds of gossip and rumours, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka&#39;s political career.
Dirty laundry will be washed mightily, hints of dark alliances between coal baron Zdenek Bakala and Sobotka&#39;s wing will appear.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes bubble up in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotko&#39;s ally Petr Kajnar are warning: &quot;I signed Charter 77 so that the country is not ruled by idiots.&quot;
If the ÚVV met already this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
Traitors sprinkle ashes on their heads and stay.
And the currently winning head of the ČSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is starting work without delay on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in pushing for the &quot;Sustainable Development Goals&quot; to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit which opened in Rio de Janeiro overnight.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now was the time to &quot;rise above national interests&quot;.
&quot;I am pleased that the member states have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the general goals of sustainable development - the SDGs,&quot; he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States and realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to come to terms with the fact that his ANO movement will not have time to learn political craft in the opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government in order to create one at all.
The chairman of ANO admitted this in an interview for Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, the plan is being thwarted by giant secret landfills
Fans of winter sports are already looking forward to the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, while others are looking at their preparations with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, even though they won&#39;t start until February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to fulfill their promise that the preparations and holding of the Games will not in the least disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
After all, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had set the bar very high, the Canadian Games went down in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin&#39;s commitment to organizing the Games with &quot;zero waste&quot; has long been taken for granted.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant dump of construction material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
In other words, environmentalists found a dump full of construction material, tires, canisters and insulation foam already in August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities caved and the dump disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a dump the size of three football fields.
She is not the only one, several such places have been created in the area, the British newspaper The Times described.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is working on the site, which is building a roughly sixty-kilometer road between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The enterprise, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin&#39;s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways argued that the dump had been set up by one of the subcontractors.
But local residents are already desperate.
According to the residents of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymta River, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
&quot;The water from here will contaminate the Sochi water sources for the next ten to fifteen years,&quot; Vladimir Kimayev from the ecological non-profit organization EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal dumps are not the only problem facing the Russian organizing committee and government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics cost $43 billion.
Last year&#39;s games in London cost only 19 billion and the mentioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected during the work on the exhibition of sports venues and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers will handle the new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the Games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
The rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in place in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of US changes to ease regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. airlines room to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight as long as the devices remain in &quot;airplane&quot; mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they can&#39;t access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining the decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to comply, but have indicated they have no plans to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had investigated the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
&quot;CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft,&quot; he said.
This issue is covered by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was sympathetic to the change but said it would abide by the regulator&#39;s decision.
&quot;We would welcome CASA to carry out an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices as we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment),&quot; the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to current regulations for the time being.
&quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices may not be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon,&quot; he said.
FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
But we&#39;re always interested in regulatory developments that may be helpful to our passengers, and we&#39;ll be sure to carefully study the FAA&#39;s decisions and the reasoning behind them.
For US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their aircraft fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile phone radio interference, as well as revise manuals, training material, carry-on programs and passenger information.
&quot;Once an airline confirms its fleet&#39;s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude,&quot; the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stowed under seats or in overhead storage during takeoff and descent.
There is nonsense in the movie Gravity, but the spectacle is beautiful, say experts
The fantastic space film Gravitation sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic for some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the film positively.
However, others find certain inconsistencies in it.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science-fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The movie Gravity is no exception, even if it looks like a &quot;physically real&quot; performance.
He isn&#39;t, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s bad.
I enjoyed it very much.
You can notice, for example, Sandra Bullock&#39;s hair, which somehow does not float in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubb Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of fire in a state of weightlessness.
According to them, spacesuits would also not withstand such blows.
The heroes in the movie Gravity often come into collision with various objects, and the suits can withstand everything without much trouble.
The plot was not spared criticism either.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth&#39;s orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
Plus, he wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the tech.
People also argue on the forums about the &quot;unrealistic&quot; behavior of the ropes.
It seems like it was meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I&#39;ve only seen him on the big screen so far, but I can definitely say that I was enchanted.
I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t a documentary, but a science fiction film.
And with such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere strictly to reality.
&quot;More than the inconsistency you mentioned, the way the space station is shown three times with a degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese) touched me.&quot;
&quot;Besides, the Chinese one won&#39;t be until the end of the decade and will probably look better than it does in the movie.&quot;
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to violate the laws of physics, so the science-oriented viewer will appreciate that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved, in the physics dictionary, as well the view of Earth from space is very realistic including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the aurora flickering on the polar regions.
Inconsistencies are sure to be found upon closer examination.
Additionally, for example, I found when reading the comments that the preferred direction of rotation of various space debris in orbit appears to be reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): The creators adapted some things to their own needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and sky-high offense against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of a similar focus, it can be seen that the creators they cared about the verisimilitude of the events depicted.
Among the moments that do not make sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits on a different inclined orbit than the ISS.
The result is a vastly different mutual speed and therefore the rescue operation could not have taken place in reality as it was depicted in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so it is not clear the origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they are no longer moving in relation to each other.
Bombardier&#39;s profit plunged as deliveries and orders fell
Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual issues in its train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its new CSeries jet, nor did it offer an update on whether the plane will follow through on an ambitious plan to enter commercial service next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane has only flown three times, raising questions about whether the testing phase is progressing well.
The results missed estimates and shares fell 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the stock from &quot;outperform&quot; to &quot;sector perform&quot; on Thursday, expecting the stock to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
&quot;While we were mostly expecting lower aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in the transportation business disappointed us significantly,&quot; Doerksen said in a note to clients.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism towards the program to grow.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft will make inroads into the lower end of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after a delay of several months, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of firm orders for the CSeries aircraft stands at a modest 177 as potential buyers await test flight results to verify the company&#39;s claims of low fuel consumption and cost savings for the airliner.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Chief executive Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 firm orders when the first aircraft entered commercial service.
Executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding according to plan.
&quot;The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground checks and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft&#39;s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to do the first flight and then focus on the updates and that&#39;s what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks, with the others not long after.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could begin operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has been evaluating its plan to bring the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
&quot;This slow pace of flight testing – while consistent with Bombardier&#39;s internal schedule – appears to reinforce our view that commissioning will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; Doerksen said.
Bombardier&#39;s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were flat at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share on revenue of 4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters&#39; IBES system.
The fourth-largest plane maker said it delivered just 45 planes during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which did not change as of December 31.
&quot;Aeronautical results were in line with our outlook, but we were disappointed by low order intake and overall market conditions,&quot; Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world&#39;s largest train maker, said revenue at the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled orders in transport amounted to 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is a marginal increase compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Executives said a new outlook would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares in Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil&#39;s Embraer SA, the third-largest maker of commercial aircraft and Bombardier&#39;s closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Mick Jagger claims that he definitely did not go after the then 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals on Jagger&#39;s 2004 song &quot;Old habits die hard&quot;.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with the veteran rocker and he walked out on her.
And she added, &quot;That was a long time ago, and now he is very nice to me.&quot;
In a statement on Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he categorically denies ever making suggestions to Katy Perry.
The representative said, &quot;Maybe you&#39;re confusing him with someone else.&quot;
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album &quot;Prism&quot; debuted at number one this week.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
&quot;This is appalling news and one has to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,&quot; said the newspaper, which deemed the bill unconstitutional.
&quot;This law is harsh and very punitive and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it is an extension of government&quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya&#39;s position in the global economy.
&quot;I hope the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,&quot; he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively hands the government &quot;total control over the media&quot; and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have &quot;taken a heavy blow&quot;, criticizing the bill as &quot;harsh&quot;.
The passage of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the immediate aftermath of the Westgate shopping mall attack by an Islamic gunman in September.
The authorities&#39; anger was turned on Kenyan media when it aired security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury store.
The police chief responded by having two journalists and a senior media officer summoned for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn following media pressure.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to 1 million, along with the risk of being &quot;delisted&quot; or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the offender&#39;s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even one fine is enough to shut down most radio stations&quot;.
It is also reported that these measures may have a liquidating effect on what is being called Kenya&#39;s &quot;vibrant blogosphere&quot;.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
&quot;You never know what might happen,&quot; wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathia, describing Kenya&#39;s media as a key source of a system of mutual checks and balances in public life.
&quot;If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and gathering,&quot; he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse cuts ordered by the national wages agency and restore their fat salaries of around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, among the highest in the world.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Treasury has tentatively worked out the capital gains tax but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in Budget 2012 introduced a 7% property transfer charge for buildings worth over £2m and annual charges for buyers who own properties within societies, not as individuals.
Property transfer tax income in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea boroughs, which reached £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: &quot;Given the increase in the transfer of high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is under-taxed regardless of the effect of the antiquated head tax system.&quot;
He added that &quot;this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy properties in London, or existing owners to be reluctant to sell&quot;.
Prime properties - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent belt that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase over the past year.
Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a booming &quot;home market&quot;, with the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) experiencing gains, according to a Savills survey growth.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner&#39;s illness
Rock group Arctic Monkeys have postponed a gig in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group were due to perform at the city&#39;s Hydro complex on Friday.
However, lead singer Alex Turner&#39;s illness forced her to postpone the performance.
The group&#39;s announcement comes after they were similarly forced to postpone Thursday&#39;s show at Birmingham&#39;s LG Arena.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: &quot;Following the decision to postpone tonight&#39;s show at Birmingham&#39;s LG Arena and following medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone their show at Glasgow&#39;s Hydro complex scheduled for Friday 1 November.&quot;
&quot;Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to perform.&quot;
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
