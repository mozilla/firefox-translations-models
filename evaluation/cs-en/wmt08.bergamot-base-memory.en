Europe inflation jumps over food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is due to the constant rise in food prices.
November's price growth in 13 eurozone countries was above expectations, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation was registered 3.1 percent, the Luxembourg-based Union statistics office reported.
The official forecast was forecast for only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian Emissions Banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate, saying that reducing, along with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below two percent, especially near them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must "deter" inflation so that it does not have to do anything on this matter later.
In Germany, November inflation is a 15-year record, rising from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent in Spain.
Eurozone inflation has risen due to rising food and energy prices.
The term prices of the company increased by 88 percent, also the course of soy reached the highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets rose 52 percent this year, already costing one barrel of black gold nearly 100 dollars last month.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent to 2.5 in 2008, while inflation will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain approximately at 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement has increased significantly after prolonged stagnation towards the beginning of December, and so now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists the Gallup Institute has never measured such low  13 percent support.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference  due to the majority determination of the opposition's voters  would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to the fifth support of the MSZP.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament, according to the survey: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among certain voters of the party, there are supporters of both camps one percent more.
The public’s view of the economy has also deteriorated given the previous low, and the ratio of those who consider the country’s economic situation to be very very heavy has never been so high, with a high of  41 percent, while, according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite delightful.
Families evaluate the change in their material situation after spring and summer more hopeful prospects now again more pessimistic.
As for the next year, the majority of the population counts on another deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents judged what was the most of the Gallup Institute's polls so far, that the Prime Minister was doing his job more appropriately than well.
Ferenci Gyurcsány believes or trusts 13 percent of respondents very much, while Viktor Orban's share of supporters is 38 percent.
The prime minister does not trust 54 percent at all, the chairman of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While after last year's October riots, the government and prime minister considered 35 percent to remain, currently that share is already only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the decision only in the call of new elections.
For the sake of a referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that it would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 percent said that it would probably come to an opinion.
By comparison, “parliamentary elections held this Sunday” would certainly be attended by only 55 percent, and another 15 percent consider their turnout to be likely. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of the current intentions.
Kolný would be told not 74, doctor's fees 79 and hospital stay fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only within the circle of people certainly promising their participation, then the introduction of kolný, fees at the doctor and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth more expensive Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaör business triangle maintained last year's, on average 16 percent increase in the price level, with the difference that this year it has not reached an increase in VAT.
Article of the journal Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs business triangle has increased by an average of 16 percent this year, especially in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of a lot over a thousand forints.
Since prices in supermarkets of food “so far” flew out last December, the percentage did not show up to such a drastic increase due to the previous high base.
It is certainly gleeful for consumers that what they could have bought last year at a price of under nine thousand forints, they will not now get for ten thousand.
The consumer of the Daily Economy in the examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The most high price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unic and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but the cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy seeds were very upset.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found kilogram bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of the two-litre Coca Cola in the returnable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, according to the consumer newspaper Napi Gazdaság Auchan, this year he appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the consumer daily Napi Gazdaság increased prices due to prices last Christmas by Cora by 15, while both Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and lower consumption benefit values, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and the highest year's highest was 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was an average of 1 480.
The average price increase last year was 1 206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the department stores were clearly unable to decide how much price range they should set for each product, since they could not predict the effect of changing prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question, he may lose a significant profit due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság newspaper last year was so extremely that the price of the most expensive horse was 1 720 forints, not in 2006, while for the cheapest, the price difference in the most respectable was 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not show, the most expensive horse now cost 1 630 more forints than last year and also the cheapest one undercut by 1 284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, it showed a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the daily consumption in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not entirely confirmed by the Central Bureau of Statistics data: in the case of several basic foods, it measured a price increase of 30 percent within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed, given the basis, even in the worst case, a price increase of barely above 10 percent.
Suppliers of flour occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers, and have managed to enforce drastic price increases in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the commercial gold triangle are not complaining, they are still reporting on a good year.
According to our testimonials, the majority of customers in the three stores do not care about the prices.
They buy quantum in the room, they take durable food after salaries.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets, there were long queues at the cash registers, or the number of visitors had risen sharply.
As we know, there is a lower turn in the countryside, and several international chains are afraid of research companies that they are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they are on disinfectants
More than a thousand cases of infection caused primarily due to inappropriate use of antibiotics have been registered in hospitals this year.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff stopping the disease do not help, according to the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, they are also on disinfectants.
She was recently diagnosed with MRSA infection at the trauma department of St John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got into the hospital after a major traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place earlier this year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with an infection of MRSA, and due to the bacterium located in his organism, one important operation could not yet be performed.
Until December 10, 1 094 hospital infections caused by multi-drug agents of the disease were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, Karolina Böröcz, head of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents have been registered with certainty in hospitals, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococci.
The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is worn by a third of people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsil inflammation, pussy infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
If antibiotics are given to an excessive degree or inappropriately, they develop from a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and which spread rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Previously, in the case of temporary or permanently deceiving functioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients in years, serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning  sepsis, can cause.
According to the chief doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections belong to daily practice in hospitals.
“Infection must not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not only there, declared Tibor Nyulasi, “where the presence of the agent of the disease is not investigated.”
It resists antibiotics
We isolate these patients, the investigating staff guards them in rubber gloves and in a mask, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first determined to see if they are present in their organism MRSA, but you can’t avoid the infection.
Sampling is not in fashion
The majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, with current conditions and conditions in home hospitals not favorable for the prevention of the development and spread of multideparted disease agents, according to Karolina Böröczová.
If this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should check the patients admitted and insulate the MRSA carriers promptly.
The collection of microbiological samples by sheep in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
This is also the role of the National Health Insurance Fund not financing these measures.
Most cases are thus revealed if the patient suffers from an perceptible MRSA infection, the epidemiological center's chief of staff said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment with antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
It is necessary to strive to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological, should be carried out in order to prevent resistance to drugs, or hospitals do not, in all cases, do not follow this.
The sampling of microbiological samples is even more rare in the basic or outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczová said.
Gets on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often among patients through medical staff.
Therefore, washing hands and wearing gloves and masks plays a very important role, and there are very important shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by a droplet infection and touch, but in the conditions of home hospitals it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the bobs are often very close together, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, we can also see that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, they are on disinfectants, there are few or more inspectors, and there are many patients who are still incursing infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are followed, similar infections are demonstrably less or can be stopped by other dimental agents of the disease.
Government program against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought.
In England, for example, the government has written a programme to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its occurrence.
The programme appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a downward trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities for the prevention of the development of multi-resistant disease agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these disease agents.
The police captain, who caused the fatal accident, was not drunk
An official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII. district, who caused the fatal accident, is done.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his office, would drive under the influence of alcohol or narcotic substances, the spokesman of the High Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital Attila Morvai said on Friday after the expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already stated that the former police captain had not eaten any alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the police headquarters of the XXII. district hit Lajos Kossuth in the XXII. district on Tuesday by his own passenger car while turning the fifty-five-year-old man, who entered in front of him while crossing the roadway outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian was crossing outside the zebra, after all, according to the rules of the road is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police director resigned from his post and asked for the transfer to the service, according to the police's statement, because he was so shocked by the case.
In the matter, the Housemaster's research prosecutor's office is conducting a square.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with prosecutors conducting research from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks totalling 400 million euros to support kolství, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework worth 300 million euros in 2006 for the Hungarian budgetary financing of projects in the field of transport and environmental environment implemented from the support of the Cohesion Fund, with parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of 100 million, the now-signed contract relates to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The 150 million euro credit agreement is also used for the budget financing of projects related to Śkolství.
The EIB has approved a total of 300 million euros for Hungary for these purposes, and the remaining 150 million euros may be used later, with the spread of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed a contract for 50 million euros, which will be used in the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of a 4th metro line at the meeting.
The parties agreed that after Hungary agrees with the EU details of the metro funding, it will return to whether and how the original treaty needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astoing  the attention of the whole of Europe turns to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys on the still cheapest, fast-paced EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination now is undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
Of the mountains, the most in the course are the areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast of Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozobol and Nessebar, and more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the interest of investors will also attract the central part of the country  for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna  and more and more interested people are also buying in the vicinity of the downright cheap city of Ruse.
The capital, Sofia, is also the promise of tempting options, business and office space promises the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of Europe’s most attractive golf paradises, becoming a popular destination for travel in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are buying in bulk, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyle at the same time.
Most of the customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Panelska and increasingly also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, by the Black Sea and in ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settling people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They demand good accessibility and the possibility of communication, important for them is the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of the cottage (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium- or long-term.
The increase in real estate in the capital is continuous, or the demand is becoming increasingly strong.
In Bulgaria, real estate prices are the lowest in the European Union, but they have grown by 21 percent annually in the last five years.
The increase in house prices significantly exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and Hungarian est percentage
According to the information of the Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday, and after Wednesday's official opening, the international conference on the climate regime will continue after 2012 with the meeting of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which is based on efforts following the period of reducing emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not wish to negotiate exact numbers now, although it is leaning towards an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 relative to 1990 levels.
Another big question of the conference is whether, in addition to decreasing emissions, developed countries will also proceed to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are dependent on it.
The agreement was also borne on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Board, most likely under the World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) at the United Nations  we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian st percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s commitment to a leading role in the pursuit of global climate protection and to help establish a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, independent of the success of the adoption of the after-2012 agreement, and is ready to commit to up to a 30 percent reduction if other developed regions of the world, respectively, developed countries are willing to accept the responsibility and commitments corresponding to their options.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set themselves the goal of reducing 5.2 percent, with the then 15 EU member states committing to 8 percent.
Hungary’s commitment is to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our homeland will meet.  is recalled in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot going on in Bali, or within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be postponed until 2012. In such a case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new emission reduction system, which was also pointed out in its latest report by the UN’s International Scientific Cord on Climate Change, the IPCC, which is the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
UK military conducts YouTube recruitment
British military units are posting on a video-sharing server recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan by which they popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) liked YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force's commanding combat operations in the Kandahar region and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
In this way, more than 139 recordings of soldiers of the British Air Force have made it to the Internet, and more than 75 thousand people have looked at their channel.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as defenceheadquarters and publishes recordings of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and international peacekeepers in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The airy forces have posted videos according to their original intention for the purpose of recruiting, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good for familiarizing the European public with the actual goal of the military's presence abroad.
“The promotion published in this form almost costs nothing compared to traditional television recruitment ads,” said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert, “which is necessarily the case with a political message, or in a special way, confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made the game
The army is worried that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also coming to the server, depicting, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official promotional films", the officers speak most about the losses, without a bloody form of combat.
After all, many videos of the battles in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, were brought to the Internet, but the British army has only now come to them.
The Americans recruit a little differently  using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
There will be Christmas in ministries with a raffle and pagos
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to 2007 poges and coffee.
In some ministries, there will be a celebration with live music, in others it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere of a raffle and a toast to the officials.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the veda table  so the mighty.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most costly ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but he does not expect his employees.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, during the Mission Christmas they will be served by the family members of the soldiers serving on foreign missions, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the hoof compared to other departments.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and from the hundred employees of the Ministry is expected to be approximately three hundred and fifty guests.
The resort will be at its celebration of Christmas traditions, but there will also be various performances and a raffle will also be drawn.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4 700 000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building  concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: it is organized by a company ensuring the course of tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To this end, they rented the Vígszínház Theatre building.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, since we were unable to reach the person concerned.
There is no need for a suit
The OIT building was hosted not only by NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas held the ball of St. Lucie.
However, OIT did not want money from him for using his halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with the minister's greeting, after dinner it was possible to dance accompanied by live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, evening clothes or suits were not mandatory at all.
The Puritan Party is being held by the health, labour and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperthová even officially does not invite her co-workers to the Christmas party, but at the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, only get coffee and pags, so only 350 000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his collaborators will simply toast in the auditorium of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas reunion, at which it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party he devotes 2 500 forints per guest  the total amount includes the reception with the vedi tables and a toast.
Since Minister János Veres is Minister, PM workers have been celebrating Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officiality is intensified not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Department is hosting a New Year's reception on January 20, and the ministerial Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will take place in Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Town Gardens and according to the Ministry’s communication, 1 000 forints per person is intended for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting of the minister and end with a minor treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of kolství and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told the portal [origo].
They were unable to tell the price of the Christmas celebrations of the environment resort in the press department.
In every case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Decorative Arts.
A giant strike is brewing
The association of trade unions of the League, respectively the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ) will on Friday create its strike commission to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
A protest public gathering will take place on Saturday, on Monday  on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act  work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause a major interruption of transport, as the railway transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also go on strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will introduce the association together with the National Union of Workers' Councils with the details of Monday's jointly organized strike.
There will also be a strike committee of the LIGA  MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
A protest public gathering will take place on Saturday, and from Monday, the unions joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period of time if there is no agreement with the government.
That means a deadline has not been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
Should Parliament fail to adopt the health insurance bill in the end, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
If the law is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to Monday's agenda of the Parliament meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on only in the late evening or night hours.
Due to the start of the strike on Monday, it is possible to expect serious interruptions of transport: on the railway station the work will be stopped for an indefinite period of time, in the morning a part of the Budapest public transport can be stopped and more than half of the companies called.
At the same time, half of the lane will also be closed in many parts of the country.
The call for strikes was joined by numerous trade unions and civic organisations, whose list is constantly updated on the League's association website.
Some organizations announced a strike for an indefinite period of time, others declared a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Employees of the Railways (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people are travelling by the railway at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the previous communication, from the beginning of the operation to 13 hours will be on strike at BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Union of Workers in the energy industry LIGA, and the Union of Educators and the Democratic Union of Educators called for a 2- or 2-hour cessation of work.
The Union of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Health Workers and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four commitments formulated by the League is for the government to withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and to put forward a new concept for public debate.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensioners in force from next year should be introduced gradually.
Third, in order to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system before 2010 for early retirement for the fields of employment concerned.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Trade Union of Employees of the Railways (VDSZSZ), under the trade union grouping of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects.
In “the risk-driven company’s warning: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that “the focus of the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Romani peoples of Hungary can lead to violent ethnic conflicts” in a short time.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an action  is supplied by the research institute.
As we will say, this can be explained by one of the biggest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: “The public debate on the Roma issue was left to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction.
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, empowers extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, the institute judges.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have “to a large extent spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity.”
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which have been receiving ever-increasing publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, is that several organizations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which they call themselves "national militia" associations.
The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming "in the armed  readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of and-empowered disasters, invasion of the homeland, invasion of order), moreover, pointing to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state, adds.
It further notes: this is what is happening in a way that seeks to wrap up the most diverse political efforts built on society's opposition to politics and parties into civilian robes.
The emphasis of civility and the form of the association, therefore, in the case of these groups, does not only serve to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also an indicator of the increasing risk in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to in several neighboring countries as a potential source of danger, ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighboring countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policy by appealing to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This can have an impact on the political stability of the area, he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As she writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was created in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the backdrop of the Bulgarian Guard stands the mass Romani riots that broke out in one of Sofia's quarters (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to establish the Guard, saying that the organization's goal is "national militia."
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been a “Gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained idle and indifferent, recalls the Political Capital Institute.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a tumultuous discussion of the Bulgarian public.
As she further writes, the increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will form their own guard in a sign of resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard show similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
When asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and if it finds anything that could affect the change in risk, they report public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk alert.
Holidays are not free in the world
In Hungary, the days off are precisely determined by law and have become a general practice, that working days are moved around the holidays, which awaits us fewer times in the next year.
In the European Union and in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and public holidays and days of rest.
The days of rest of work are more important for church holidays or important historical events.
Here we also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a working day  on New Year's Day already so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the 1848 and 23 revolutions. October, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the foundation of the state, on May 1 work, on November 1 and 2 we remember deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, the two-day holidays of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are here.
Since the national, national or religious holidays, according to the calendar, rarely fall on the weekend, it has become a practice of moving the working day in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends is that the previous Saturdays remain in the workplace and in the school.
When we work for the day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday, the Minister of Labour has been adjusting for many years in a special ordinance.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employed workers, to public employees and to persons in public service.
It does not concern companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or with regard to their determination also work on days of rest.
This year, the rules of employment will change only around the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, or according to the previous experience, the majority of people will work in advance or thus take a deprived holiday.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively, at the end of the week, so the transfers of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be transformed around the work holiday so that workers can then stay home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a rest day.
The next move is related to the holiday 23. October: Saturday 18. October will be working instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year will be completely marked by the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost nonstop holidays even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
est of removing little things that you can eat your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, innocent lies that we can hardly even miss: this is what “diversifies” the sidewalls of the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves and unclear situations that others can get angry about, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were being sought from the marketing department," a colleague announces.
♪ Have you missed the meeting because of it?
In the best case, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or calls the marketing department and says that he forgot to pass the message (that's a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is handled by one apology.
Before it comes to embarrassing apologies, it’s good to think about how you can prepare uncomfortable moments for your colleagues and consciously avoid it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than when you reach out for a document, office use, or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember putting a crosshairs on your desk yesterday, but she's gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on the desk of one of your colleagues, which you thought were lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will rightly be angry with you for digging into their affairs.
Do not take envelopes or duct papers from the office, because it can be unpleasant if you run out of prematures, and you will need them in an Instant.
A gossip about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good idea how to stop the gossip.
Who, with whom, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don't put your messages on your nose (assumptions) about the private life of colleagues!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Do you report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and, citing a severe headache, report your absence because you are not well, or you think that today you would rather rest, think that your work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain deadline will have to be done for you someone else.
Consider your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something can happen that you will have to stay at home for, please report it so that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence the next day.
Hunging, giggling, phone calls
Have you immersed yourself in work, where you will be grossly pulled out by a giggling colleague?
Have you accidentally witnessed a phone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by humming, singing, loud talk (overhead), or stomping, constant cursing, loud dissatisfaction.
This can be even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame another for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to any chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you have made a mistake and someone has paid for it, and repair the harm!
Ask how you could put the matter in order, correct the negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Sweatpants and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, sheep in the office do not fit!
Do not wear leisure clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Don't be sloppy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in common places, and if your profession is asking for it, nice and elegant!
If you want to be happy, you can no longer be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic.
There is a strange tune from the radio: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes the pace and the previous tone is added to the bass, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
At mr2 station, the song by Zagar is called Wings of Love.
Home music life has not long spoiled us with high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, however, the traffic looks quite different because you are listening to the new album Zagaru.
The revelation of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground, slowly changes the overall picture, and although it is again in fashion of garage rock with its beating into the guitar, even home electropop proves that something new is under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five Churches and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until in the end  perhaps because two bagpipers can't fit into one of the chards  he went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through, when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film by Ferenc Török Szezon).
His formation, playing in the beginning in smaller clubs, recognized the Irish audience after the wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the fifty most important domestic albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie to be almost the only domestic entities determining developments that could be marketable in the West.
Zagar and his band are without a doubt in the course, although of course no one asked them if they are satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as they belonged: they made a new, sticky album.
The now-released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths for them, although the title itself is trying to create a follow-up to the initial flights in the Five Church.
This is one of the songs of the old band Balázs Zságer.
A reference to etheric, flying would be in place, but in addition to the ethereal touch of this music, it has now appeared  in harmony with the spirit, the trend of the time  the louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the album in the Millennium Paris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music from morning to evening, began to still the swishing melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with resti domestic singers (Underground Divas).
All right, then (?).
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, how much does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition marginal music doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not an alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don’t say anything, and it can also be created just for the sake of selling, which makes it commercial.
Even a good pop song can stem from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted, independent of language and national borders, also works.
Hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their 20s, but also older ones.
They follow much more the transformations of light music around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and in how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived as a sleeper in concerts, where there is already an influence between them, but it hides only in the intangible transformations of the moment.
Still, I've been wondering if a person wants to suit the audience, it's no longer interesting since then.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works solo and has built his career from us to the west.
B. Z.: We don't really go his way, regardless of how they sometimes experience explaining the music.
We sleep team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
At first, of course, it was not possible to avoid comparing our work to the compositions of Yonderboie, and several of us separated from his band and went down a different path.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the station mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love came first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular way, did you consciously open yourself to the layers?
B.Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit to sell the album to.
There's more to the song.
We intended her as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more serious topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the singers' job?
Why is  what was the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to assemble this choir from the soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So this estist-member choir , that is, Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, which we then re-christened on the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this how you intended the song, or did the girls recreate something about it?
B.Zs.: The song had already existed in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material for the board came together, we thought that something would be needed for this song.
A sequence of chords led to join him in a singing part.
That night, I sang a tune on him, which the girls later learned.
It all worked out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it made a living, but of course it took Wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own roles, they sing completely together and they're not louder than the music, so the music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were also on stage in the back.
That intentionally?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where who is, where they belong, and just letting ourselves be lifted by those wings of love.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
Hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the music, actually, with not one, the other pieces occurred while mixing.
For example, Dorian Grays Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or RocknRoll Goes To The Girls, where he didn’t want to work groove for a long time, then all the pretty slowly found his place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's always changing by touring and by the fact that I've already released the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous broker risked billions of inferiority
A treacherous defraudant.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of a domestic Komerční banka, refers to its fabled employee Jerome Kerviel.
It lost almost five billion euros.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and, moreover, certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally weaker," came the voices of his superiors, who sent police to him.
But, according to Kerviel’s testimony, which was brought by French media, such as the daily Le Monde, he was a man who made 1.6 billion euros of his trades at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in testimony.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had repayment problems in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not have had an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything to himself.
In the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that it didn't come to him.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange became interested in his trades.
The risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come for it?
Not more like that.
"I thought that just the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for a bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to take so many risks?
He had to gradually work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
Still, he knew he would never make as much as others.
"Even in my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to Alllianz shares, he made a half-billion euros in the bombings of London.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
We'll let you go as long as you're making money
"It's like a snowball," he told police.
But the bosses knew everything, or rather suspected it.
"As long as I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
But then came the blow earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I’ve only chosen four days for the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a holiday is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to acquire 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (around 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is still among the least successful in the current drawing of money from EU funds within the newly adopted countries.
The 20-year sentence for ex-president Nicaragua was upheld by the court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former country president Arnold Aleman, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will be back in prison is unclear at this time, according to the Associated Press.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on prison officials whether to allow Aleman to serve his sentence at home or to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court proved to Aleman that he regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of that money then ended up in a fund that Aleman had set up to fund his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved the budget
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed last year with the support of the ČSSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic was going on this time.
The Chamber of Deputies has approved the bill in peace, although the most influential.
It's a paradox.
Every government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or doesn’t like it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government's power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more grateful in the media and therefore much more attention is paid to it in the media.
The argument of politicians is far more interesting to the public than the austere numbers.
State budgets in past Social Democratic governments have suffered from three ills that the latter is unable to resolve at once for 2008:
The first is a high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the quiet "coalition" of the ČSSD and the KSČM last year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first ailment.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficit of budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the deficit of budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, get additional resources for investment, often recklessly issuing bonds that unreasonably indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other power grids they have received from the state in privatization.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting the CSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state became increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more sensibly than our republic.
It's a huge embarrassment that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have swelled to gigantic proportions in recent years.
Although it has managed to abolish some of the senseless populist spending approved this year before the elections, if the pension and pension reform thresholds are not pushed in the near future, then effectively any policy in this country will end, and whoever governs it will be mere in office.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing the majority of taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the displacement of normal expenditures by mandatory spending.
A planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments have failed to make it through what they can in the last ten years.
If we do not want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and give this not very strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only issue as much as it can get in taxes and fees, peace of mind to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in financial markets.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be introduced into the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank auctions the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send forty billion dollars to auction, and another twenty-four will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time that the central banks of individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move is intended to address the economy's greatest difficulties, a growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumil of the economic Outlook Group told clients in a report.
"The coordinated action of central banks reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to about fifty percent," Baumol added in his report.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars because of non-performing loans, primarily in the United States.
Analysts expect even more billion-dollar losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else may follow when they have decided to do this," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also borrow more expensively to their customers.
That would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with possible impacts on the world's economic growth.
Central banks have thus decided to lower the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about borrowing money from each other, even though the US, Canada and Britain central banks cut interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank move will contribute to sparking the crisis because it does not address the underlying problem, and that is the downfall of the US property market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to hurt developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus has once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now descended on the end of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he said the environmentalists' debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality, is unacceptable.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president emphasized when presenting his book that its theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so involved for them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter cartoons of my opinions."
Now those interested can read his unbiased attitudes.
Klaus recalled that while he is not a climatologist, he has, in his opinion, sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to observe and judge professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
He called the main conclusions of the book that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not very great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When asked by those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefit."
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people did not have to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can still issue a new card to them by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would go on the road after the New Year without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While municipalities are reporting a sharp drop in interest in the exchange of a driver's license, authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed with requests and interest in the exchange of a licence has risen this week.
The magistrate rolls away around 2000 clients a day.
It is expected in queues for about half an hour.
Approximately 140,000 drivers have not exchanged their driver's licenses in Prague.
The issue of a new card takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver pays five hundred crowns.
Motorists who fail to obtain a mandatory exchange of their licence by the end of the year and drive on the road without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will be reduced to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, even a person who is not going anywhere could be fined by the town hall.
He was also supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The ministry previously called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum of a thousand-crown fine.
According to the Ministry of Transport spokesperson Karel Hanzelka, however, tens of thousands of fines are not in danger of anyone.
According to him, a driver's license is a document for which people can decide whether or not to want it.
It is not an ID card that every person must have valid.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
Just take it or send it by registered mail to the competent municipal office.
With the end of the year, the cards issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
Motorists must also gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
Court cuts sentences on detectives affiliated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal conspiracy with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
This was decided by the Prague High Court, which reduced their sentences by one year and the other by two years.
Originally, detectives of the Prague Department for the Fight against Organized Crime threatened for 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but he is still waiting for the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already been given sentences in the sum exceeding 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of involvement in robbery robberies, the High Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have denied the indictment since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, in agreement with Berdych, members of the police, among other things, passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up individual robbery robberies and helped gang members to avoid criminal liability.
The gang handed over 30 percent of the magnifying glass for Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment involved the gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious injury to health, but also about the abuse of the authority of a public official and illicit arming.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, bullets with a steel core, a laser sight or a submachine gun.
According to the charges, the gang came by robbery for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the nearly twenty men in the trial, the courts have already finally found them guilty of other Berdych robberies and a number of other people.
Other men around Berdych are still being held before the trial in a different trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are residing in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a final decision on their extradition for prosecution to the Czech Republic.
Child substitution account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in the hospital, the lawyer of the damaged families, Igor Veleba, wants compensation of 12 million crowns, plus court costs, after the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers of three million, for a father of two million and for children of a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, therefore fundamentally disagrees with Veleby’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But in order to make up our minds about the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has commissioned.
We'll find out if it has any telling value at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should range between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month, when she did not raise her biological daughter.
He served Veleb as a basis for negotiating compensation for an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Parents of children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better endured by men, although they were struggling with regrets that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, find it harder to cope with the news of the trauma experienced, and with what is happening right now, he summed up the content of Veleb.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the Třebíč hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the Governor of the Highlands, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families to reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damage.
In case of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can apply for the help of the founder.
The courts have so far awarded people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The soup lost the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Wallachian Kingdom brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the name was used for the first time by the Wallachian king, but the project was built by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor.
Soup did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not over and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitize the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone remembers the actors and comedians at the words of the Wallachian Kingdom.
Harabiš has the same opinion.
"There's almost a decade of work behind us.
Looking for money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and could get something out of it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the designation Wallachian king first used Polívka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary event turned out to be a trade and a lucrative business activity, which was followed by Harabiš to establish the company Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to put his name and signature on his passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only took advantage of the bare idea that Polívka published in management for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, which devoted himself intensively to him.
The cooperation of today's disputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the deposition of the "King of Boleslav I. elected to the still".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken at the instigation of Harabiš by singer Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was dismissed by the court today.
Clearly, it could bring Harabiš's upcoming contest for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He did not want to reveal the details and the deadline.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also apply," Harabiš added.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
In fact, I've never been a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of shifting, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the station wagon called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the space on the head in the back seats.
This is the end of the complaints here, because the body of the station wagon means that even two-meter-long ones will not suffer in this direction.
Flying through the world
I'll go over the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where I have the only rebuke to the poor center tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
Also, the lateral lead improved significantly against the 206.
In terms of space, there is also an increase in the dimensions of the body.
The station wagon then disappears the already mentioned lack of space overhead.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing about this car is its luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (even thanks to the tilting rear window) and as decently stored.
The deaf spots are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are the ideal compromise.
It does not get in the way, it can be stretched and at the same time it will keep even heavier objects.
But let's pause together over the volume.
According to the tables, it is 428 l in the basic layout, which is more of an average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is very noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre petrol four-cylinder engine with a power output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a sixteen-hundred-year-old should look like, which drives the family hatchback.
It is quiet, has little consumption and above all pulls.
If I compare it to the Škoda equivalent, which sometimes acts as if it has a stuffed rag in the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The price list will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a petrol 14,000 for 329 900 Kč will still go.
Our unit costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already quite a lot.
The tested equipment Premium then throws in the equipment for another 80 000 Kč on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs everything 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but count the additional equipment at the Fabia and you will come to a very similar number.
So we have to decide on a brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not going well
In British schools, children from Eastern European countries are increasing, which raises concerns about the further development of local education.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans has faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous peoples are growing into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Fights, bullying and fights between pupils have also been transferred into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old pupil with an iron rod.
The guilty defend themselves that the boy insulted her with racist abuse.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly covered the man with racist remarks and threw rocks at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed to a bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he swung apples and pears at us, and then revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils told The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local residents even called the disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to become tense.
In Britain, 70 thousand Slovaks are registered to come here for work.
About 30 thousand Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba the Caribbean's most beautiful island
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be done if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters, offering pizza, ice cream and heady cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea, you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
But only on one island you will find much more, and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus described it as the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure transfer center that the Spaniards in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 20's.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses grew up in Havana, cars were driven on wide boulevards, which belonged to the iconic symbols of the 50's of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of the Bodeguity del Medio, both show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And what about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in Bodeguita, Havana.
In the bar of the expensive hotel Nacional, they will make you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 50's drive around Havana so far, because the once imported stings and fiats in that salty and damp air have long since rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is very dilapidated, yet there are not so many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the vicinity, as there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown up not only in Havana, but especially on Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguin and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pound, which is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by train drivers.
The cane from the large plantations was transported to the sugar mills on narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines whose contours are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not miss.
And so there's not much to write about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway homestead and who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viñales valley in the west of the island.
The vegetation grows from the limestone bedrock.
Mogots, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and a fertile soil has been caught in their hollows, thanks to which the weathered rocks are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can encounter its final appearance if you visit one of the Havan factories for the production of cigars.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean work of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
The ancient city, which was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought him fame and fortune.
Wealth has become a beauty and exhibition of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that there was no road in the 1950s that would have connected the county to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing broke, everyone was glad to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time for Trinidad than one in the afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón beach, or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening, you can go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it quiets down over the morning.
Baracoa
Some call the town in the very east of Cuba the most beautiful on the island.
Surely such an opinion influences the journey itself.
The two roads that lead from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and pass through nature, which human activity has hardly affected.
The eastern outpost of Cuba was put on the UNESCO list of UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and downhill, where the former castle and today's hotel El Castillo stand, several table mountains can be seen, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of the Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions professed by the descendants of the former slaves, all of which could be described in many pages.
But, as they say correctly, better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few troops and the lack of equipment needed affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
NATO, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going as expected, the leaders of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called for more activity, the UK sees priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and intensifying development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military power can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow residents to kick-start the further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is the highest in five years, according to U.S. military data.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies came to the very limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We will need to seriously reflect on the specific goals for the next time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar sense today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
There have also been disputes between the participating countries in recent months about whether all allies do their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for passivity.
"Germans have quite a number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the fighting demands on them are not as high as those of us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
Britain's Sun tabloid this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan bums revealed: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material, accompanied by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went on the counter-attack and printed a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The national debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to a better development of the state budget management.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns since June.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed today its data on the national debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, the debt is over 84,000 crowns.
In the whole of last year, the state became indebted to more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could only surpass the trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told news server iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, sees it the same way: "We could get to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could shift to 2010.
But I don't anticipate that change," he said.
Debts are rising
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government and arises primarily by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The state's foreign debt has so far risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year.
The so-called tradeable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Total debt rose 13 percent year-on-year for the first to third quarter, which is really a lot to the economy's progress.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's wrong that the debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to do business with when pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The strategy of financing and managing the national debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to a better development of the state budget management.
The amount consists mainly of the deficit of the state budget, which will probably reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion-dollar provision for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion crowns.
The woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for giving the name to a teddy bear
A British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night and deported, as her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting the Swiss pupils of up to seven-year-olds give the teddy bear the name Muhammad despite any depiction of the prophet Islam being banned.
She was sentenced to a whip.
The British 45-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of Sudan's Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in the month of September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
“Eight names will be heard from the children’s mouths, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s headmaster.
After voting is held in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohammed as the most popular name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a bear accompanied by the caption: "My name is Muhammad."
The bear himself had no label with this name on him, but the trouble is in the depiction of the prophet himself, considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' fellow Muslims, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, has specified that she knows her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name," he said, is merely "innocent misconduct."
Such a view is shared by many pupils of the teacher, who describe her as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "never speak of religion in the classroom".
Recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most commonly given first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to honor a prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Finally, failure.
On Wednesday morning, the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome the different views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to ensure their commitments to keep peace and were ready for dialogue even after the negotiations ended.
“We don’t expect violence anytime soon, but we’re entering a challenging period,” he added, adding that “it is evident that the situation is tense.”
Negotiations close on December 10
The Troika's negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent is Albanian-speaking population, could be shown in a clearer light as of December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to submit their report to the U.N. Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the United Nations, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika to negotiate newly.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond that deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a solution negotiated, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of international community governance, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the supervision of the EU to be a one-to-one viable solution.
Pristina declares that in the event that the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on expanded autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," announced the president of the Kosovo government, Fatmir Sejdiu, in a Baden hotel, where this "last chance" meeting has been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and the province's future prime minister, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that compromise is still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the province's possible unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "domino effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of the 1990s wars for independence.
"For Serbia, however, this does not mean," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say"
"Only the solution from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: in the grounds of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word on status" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would take place "in agreement" with the West.
Bush has reached a deal on the Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened on his impulse, U.S. President George W. Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed to immediately begin negotiations with the intention of once and for all to resolve a 60-year-old dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of the two men, Bush vowed to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the responsibilities that flow from the "road map" to peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all undecided issues without exception, including central issues."
The statement covers three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the 1948 conflict from their homes on the territory of today’s state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the U.S. president, emphasising that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "jerusal, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Olmert then spoke at the grandstand, expressing the position that subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it is necessary to ensure that it is concluded during 2008".
Bush determined the end of 2008 as the date for the realization of his "bi-state vision," Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has made a commitment from Bush in this sense before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially since it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saudi said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper, patronized by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the officers are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, the official version does not coincide with what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the General Inspection of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car drove through Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday shortly after 17 a.m.
"The vehicle was not in intervention mode, but it was on patrol and passing at 40 to 50 km/h, while the side lights were not switched on," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without the permission to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without helmets, was passing through "very high speed".
"The bike crashed from the left side into a police car after not giving preference from the right," one police officer said.
A promile of alcohol test in the blood performed on the vehicle's crew proved negative.
The condition of the car (punctured front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the sharpness of the impact.
Marie-Thérèse de Givry, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise), reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that she had instructed IGPN to investigate "acts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to people in danger", which is also taken over by the départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Director).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation led by IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the officers for the accident.
The three witnesses to the accident, who were interrogated on Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely that the mini-motorbike approached them relatively quickly from the left".
A kind of groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was carried out on the bodies of the two victims yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, talk spread quickly among people that officers should have left the crime scene quickly without giving two youngsters first aid.
The IGPN was, in all caution, also to rule out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"This is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more search and with which it is necessary to be very careful," the police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness of those few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads right where the accident took place.
"Immediately, together with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, we ran downstairs to try to resurrect them," the witness said.
There was nothing we could do."
He then saw a "limping, completely terrified policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and a fourth spoke on the phone."
In the face of the rapidly growing tension and certainty of those present that the situation of the youths was hopeless, the officers were taken away by the car of colleagues, who in the meantime arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the police officers left."
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush to the youths' aid.
These youngsters were given first aid.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
Tensions in Pakistan are rising
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of an exceptional condition by General Musharraf, two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers, demonstrating against measures taken under an exceptional condition, were wounded by tear gas grenades, which, according to witnesses, were used by riot forces.
The latter responded with rocks, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where officers attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court advocates called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights campaigners and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were dammed with roadblocks on Monday morning, in order to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were to take place in Multan (middle) and in Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency, and the garbage to those who took the oath of office before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced Saturday night.
In the next few days, he was due to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election, which took place on 6. October.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“All we are witnessing is unlawful, unconstitutional and against Supreme Court rulings,” the official said in The News.
The promise of Parviz Musharraf to give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president," he said after the introduction of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The deputy minister of information also confirmed that the January election could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted speculation in the country that the deputy head of the army should have ordered President Musharraf to be under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy is still unexpected
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, a study led by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called. Neuwirth's law, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
The enactment of contraceptives has enabled better "fertility control," the institute argues, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between 20 and 44 years of age fell from 5% in 1970 today to 60%.
Finally, eight births out of ten today are well planned.
One couple in five even have a birth calculated for a month accurately and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
A remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work was needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel necessary for the station's further scientific activity.
It was a risky ascent into space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned and the degree of "diligence" that astronauts spent on repair.
The trouble surfaced on Tuesday, while astronauts from the ship Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese science lab (see frame).
This module is a kind of landing pier for module-laboratories.
But you need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a seventeen-and-a-half-ton module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to anchor at its final location.
After she moved it, the crew began to break down the module's sixty-seven-meter solar panels.
And in this, one of the panels, decomposing like a pull-on harmonica, as a result of the cable pinching, was damaged on a surface of almost one meter.
The decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a control exit to the Discovery ship, and then go repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to pursue a damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the station's shoulder, and make a correction.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the American Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
High, robust, very skillful, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by a doctor to "operate" a "injured" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed a kind of "splint" to the damaged areas.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" that remained near the leveling chamber, and also from the inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-stick-painted insulating device, to prevent electroshock from being prevented on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "handyman" made by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely decomposed and then inventoryed his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing notice on the Paris Stock Exchange after the airline operating in the aerospace and defense industry announced it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to face delays in the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its projected production results for 2007 due to delays resulting from the slow progress of the advance development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the initiating flight.
The price for easing the delays in the supply of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was quantified "at 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus," the parent company of European designer EADS announced.
Because of these costs, EADS, next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before subtracting interest and taxes (EBIT).
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponded to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS’s production results fell 86% in 2006 mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the giant A380.
Originally, the group anticipated that it would provide the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday's election will take place without tense expectations: The Russians will majority-elect President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming, after the end of the very few free election campaigns, their tendency to stability, even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the election to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded television message to voters on public broadcasters, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so from the position of leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that seems to celebrate a crushing victory.
When he accepted the ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president did not let anything come out of him and was satisfied with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for an honest, as transparent and open election as possible, an election without the slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not the case.
They condemn the campaign, marked by various coercions.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, not even under Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstration, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, he continues to be banned from visiting, according to his vocacus.
"The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality"
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple, tense anticipation, two far more open questions are being profiled:
- "Who will become Putin's successor in the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public by December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
But no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will choose the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will prevail all along the line in the parliamentary, as it will in the presidential election.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have remained the mentality of homo sovietica, they do not feel like they are the masters of their destiny,” said Leo Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg observes a more time-reasonable context: civil society has taken on a delay in this country, five centuries after Europe; that glorious common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed up on the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic well-being," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "voluntarily give up personal responsibility" that they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What to think about?"
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 Russian regions) are running the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a fifty-four-year-old professor: "What to think about?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are opening up to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored in the length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were until now accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of the former victim or her authorized persons.
Eleven archives-in charge - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to examine "especially the transfer of prisoners, the camp population and the health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or warrants put together by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor subjected to civilian citizens, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way to their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," prof. said in 2006. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin's Technische Universität.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade treaty in 2008
Today, bilateral trade between Europe and India is almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade treaty in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations to sign free trade treaties (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already nearly 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The free trade agreement is hugely doping both economies" and "India will get better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" together each year, Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barrosa.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
The Bank of England on Thursday signaled that it intends to ease current fears of worsening credit market conditions again and announcing a 10-billion-pound offer in a five-week auction at a key interest rate of 5.75%, an offer in effect unusually long.
"In order to ease the concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavorable at the end of the year and give banks more certainty in the way to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said in a communiqué.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
It seems like the first time BOE is pumping cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally they last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it "remains ready to implement additional measures to keep interest rates on a daily basis" of interchange loans at the same level with its base rate.
The inter-day interbank interest rate was at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest number since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the fee rates that have discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation reinforced by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many preferred to opt for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
The UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, the Union for the People's Movement) and the NC (Nouveau Centre) refuse to address the Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs declined to discuss individual paragraphs of the Socialist Buyability Bill on Thursday, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text of the bill came on the agenda within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by an individual parliamentary club) and included a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which was an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the restoration of fluctuating TIPPs, a traffic cheque or regulation of rents.
Given that the UMP and the NC voted against the hearing of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the session was concluded after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of opinion, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television appearance on purchasing capacity.
The head of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will re-present these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finances Bill, which the House will discuss next week.
A new festival is being born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Republic Festival of British Organizer Melvin Benn, announced.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 is produced by Chicago's Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is the summer destination of campers.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8-10 on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took charge of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80 000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Republic Festival established the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Beginning in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licenses and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 describes Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced, saying his firm and Melvin Benna's firm are working simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
“We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to start a festival in Philadelphia’s centre,” said Charlie Jones.
"We negotiated with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we have become bogged down in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to establish a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after they excelled on the festival stage in 2002 with the arrangement of the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 were 9.8M$ and 11.3M$.
Both of these festivals take place in urban environments.
“The European model of Melvin Benn’s festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way to create both the impression of a rural festival in the European and the urban after the American."
Vineland is located roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The municipality of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the realization of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to divulge the terms of the agreement, but argues that "they are profitable enough to allow them to invest in such an event and to welcome a festival that will, hopefully, last for a long time."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which accommodates 80,000 people.
He says invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is yet to be put to print.
“Vineland will have a rocky touch, but the music will be varied to attract a wide range of audiences if possible,” said Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the final Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
His mandate, however, is "politically challenging" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into the "Guvernator"'s claws??
"It's important to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider to be the best,” he said.
The Hunt for Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the local film.
The hunt for the Oskars has already begun.
At all the West Coast festivals, whether it's festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about introducing Quebec movies, drawing attention to them and ensuring that the directors give interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be shown at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer at Santa Monica and will be unveiled in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon on the stock exchange at the end of the year? Experts divided by 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors are already holding hands with me in anticipation of a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange has a positive course".
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, markets have, at least in the short term, some doubts."
These experts do not expect the stock exchange to move in the final weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market maintains the existence of liquidity, which is prepared to invest in the absence of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, influenced by the effect of turnover to quality securities, both in long and short sections."
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "mainly because there is no known impact of the likely fall in Fed rates (Federal Reserve System) rates, given the high level of oil prices and the dangers of incentives for inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time for bold statements that a marathon will occur.
"There is not much reason to be happy," the expert assures.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum figures recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points by regrouping portfolios and traditional pension deposits that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will happen earlier, in the second week of December after a long weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "therefore we could observe the reflection of the index, triggered by reports from the US on the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles to make sure they bring Ibex to new maximum dimensions.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the turn of strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, by contrast, assures that the rises will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves on this marathon if it occurs.
"ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and the FCC will go the same way," the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also do very well, although they are not very represented in this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of slumps on two occasions.
The real marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock market ended the crisis triggered by the bursting of the tech bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 won back 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth profitable year (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the brand Popular Max are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that also assured several times that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, he intends to strike a deal with the unions to cancel opening hours of 75% of his branches on Saturday in exchange for extending opening hours by one afternoon, though not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular will be crucial in order for other entities to join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of trades, or not.
This is the goal of the project, which was set out by the bank Popular.
To get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, sole traders and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in its business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This extends the opening hours with a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
The bank's sales director, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not involve a major investment, but more recruitment, as it is switching from six employees to a branch of eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with spaces for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested the initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets, and according to Rivero, it appears to have been a happy choice.
The Popular bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financing products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients,' according to Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónica to sell their mobiles through external staff.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3, for the first time on the stock market
We did it'.
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of trading, stating that the television he was running had doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I'm sorry for is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we've fallen less', he declared.
And he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday with a shift of 2.54%.
That gain pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) thus reaches 4 488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% overall since January, has a half-worth of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecoms firms that have been valued is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in the viewership'.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first TV channel to surpass a billion gross advertising revenue this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that provides the group's advertising.
If the data were actually forecast, the TV channel would see an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antena 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (and thus reached 734.4 million), while the television's net revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on is the increased pay out for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even though it is early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent firm Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give a minimum of 50%, although we have always reported much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, who have already increased the value of 33% Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its Telecinco profit estimates, up from 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth has stalled from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same firm reduced Antena 3's projected profit, at 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approved the transposing of MiFID in force from November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary hearings that were concluded today by a vote of Congress on amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government subjected a public hearing to a regulation that is developing the new law, with the aim of bringing the two into effect before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties equally highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, foresees the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial advisory services to both specialised companies and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS) companies, financial advisory companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokerage offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of financial instrument operations is increasing by connecting to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and internalising order systems that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The Act also obliges firms providing investment services to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management, and requires keeping a statement of all operations performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the hearing in the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which it stands out that securitized claims are considered a "complex" financial instrument given the high danger for the investor, which has been demonstrated by what occurred in the U.S. with high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposing of the Directive was used to legally designate functions that can be held by Bachelors in the Field of Economy and Business Management 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV, and will be able to provide product trading services and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union's inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as is used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (States Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure that comes into account on 14 December this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said November's increase to 4.1% is a "temporary number," but predicted that the price index would continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes, in the couloirs of Congress, specified that "even if it will not be a favorable number," Spain's inflationary differential against the monetary union has remained "more or less" the same in the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not account for such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the economy minister said.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock got into a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
The bank then managed record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually declined in two and a half months of client distrust despite the government offering a hundred percent guarantee for this money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the name of the entity with its Virgin Money brand, needs to earn around a quarter of the revenues invested in British banks over the next three years to earn the remaining 18 billion pounds to reach a target of 30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for his striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve his resolution.
Northern Rock this week called Virgin's offer, which consists of three other companies, as the one they prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murtsian city of Totana (from the People's Party) in the early hours of the morning because of his alleged involvement in corruption practices in construction that were unveiled this week.
One of the town hall secretaries and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People's MP, in May this year, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources approached by Cadena SER television, could have been the 'head' of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission, and further arrests are not excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in corruption practices in construction, was charged, which was revealed earlier this week.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, lawyer Juan Morales, who was inspected, was arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important corruption-related documents.
According to investigative sources, Morales's alleged collection of commissions for signing an agreement on construction with a Galician construction company, which has been overqualified, is also under investigation by Morales's alleged collection of commissions for signing an agreement on construction with a Galician construction company that has been overqualified.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono has accepted an offer to stand at the head of the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, preside over Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary-General Jose Luis Rodríguez Zapater to head the PSOE (Spain Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election and become president of Congress if the Socialists win the general election.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE Secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place today at noon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The executive chief justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He further noted that "yes, it seems," that this politician from La Manchy will be a candidate of the Socialist Party for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono, as president of Congress, would replace Manuel Marín, who on November 15 made his decision not to run for office in the next general election and to abandon his active political career to pursue the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister had constantly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He further stated that, just as citizens know who will be the deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to "transparent in a form" of announcing who will preside over Congress.
If Bono wins this position, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not of swearing or shouting" and to "more and more like citizens."
“Sometimes, unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak peace and quiet is Congress, has been interrupted by the Prime Minister in the Senate on one occasion 26 times.”
He also spoke praised the words in the address of the current chairman, Manuel Marín, and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so that he would not decrease to how he stated what his opponents might consider "greatness."
Climate propaganda
Given that the anti-climate change movement subjects ruthless persecution to both those who view its predictions skeptically, and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must demonstrate firm coherence.
Plus, having a leader of a movement that is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal forces him to explain why the activities or inactions of his government have significantly contributed to Spain's conduct in the European Union in the non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors it is happening and why its government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take in order to hinder climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, we will have to accept and what the economic consequences will be.
In other words, who sacrifices themselves and who pays to save the planet.
But we have not received such explanations, we will not even wait.
This is because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of elections that he hurried to reject it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet so that it does not cost anything, pure propaganda, slogans that lack any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the covenants with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not accuse, demands nothing, but is an ornament of meetings and stirs up tenderness.
If it confines itself to being just a virtual party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool down with a fan.
Mayor and chief of local police Totany detained on suspicion of corruption practices in construction
As the investigative sources reported, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totan, the "people's" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and taken to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located along with a number of police officers, who also came to the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Land and Flats.
The three arrests added to the six that occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation associated with the overqualification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for development, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4 000 houses.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged in a shortened trial in the court of the first instance of the city of Totan.
The first six of those arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are under investigation.
He was also charged with his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totana and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is carried out by the group for offences under the construction of the Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to those arrested, based in Madrid, Vig, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (the province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of a well-known owner of a poultry meat company who could have served as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with building the largest residential complex of the Murtsian city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was overqualified and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, the same day that the critic of Blackburn’s book also happened to appear there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at a school in the city of Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical position on Plato and argued that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague informs about the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet to the Criminal Code:
A. The withdrawal of one song would be a crime at a rate from six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you dispose of a plate in the price of less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1 000 euros in a store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It's less serious to participate in a fight than a shift in compacts.
The rate of rioting is from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered to be less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than the download of a film on DVD.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
So if my colleague is not wrong, someone's hand is gone, and properly.

My attending physician shoves me one of his articles about strange research titled "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that a monthly paycheck is triggered by employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on the tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and lead group Viewing the Neurocognics of the Institute of Life&Brain in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant reacted correctly and his colleague wrongly."
The researchers observed that if both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was moderate, but when one got doubled, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been fiercely pursuing criminals from the prosecutor's office of the Court of Justice in The Hague of the Balkan War.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary "Karlin list" (2006, not listed in Spain) took over, which follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in the pursuit of escaped criminals and pressure on the respective states to retract the network.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense that depends on various factors, such as age, status, gender, the length of possession of the driver's license, the type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company receives an agreed insurance amount of a certain amount for taking charge of paying damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance premiums are the price of insurance, which is determined with regard to various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driver's license, the type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the greater the likelihood of a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies concluded that persons living in marriage have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of journeys and thus the likelihood that it will have an accident.
The increase in the frequency of journeys increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when they determine the price of premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best corresponds to his profile of the insured person.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to complying with the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five encounter various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and a short possession of a driver's license when they want to arrange premiums at an affordable price.
Although the insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount of premiums to get insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This kind of contract would presuppose the client's participation in the payment of the insured event.
"Part of the payment of the insurance claim provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the premium, which will be all the higher the lower the co-payment would be," explains Luis Noguera, chief executive of First Europe in Spain, an internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in the operation so that the client insures against damages caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and prevent accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, malus is an increase in the aforementioned basic rate.
"The bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to raise the bonus,” Noguera explains.
After crossing the twenty-five-year limit, drivers are easier to get insurance, because the client’s risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance when there is a crash, and neither can they manage," the director of the European company in Spain assures, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of proceedings, when the "fear of a newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance premiums (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other traffic participants, starting from the third year since the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," remarks Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to insure against all risks with a discount of premiums (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other traffic participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of a crash, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us best in view of our personal situation.
Celtic try to score a point at AC Milan, which means eight-final
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the "Champions" league, as it would mean being first for the Italians and the Scots would decide to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured their advance in the fifth game by a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but he needs one more to be sure that Shakht'or will not be in front of him with six points, who will play with Benfica, who has four.
The two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round is over, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play for the first time in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is being played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others and the undecided result at Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to fight for victory because the Italians won't want to be tactical on home soil and Celtic know that after the win he would be first and would secure a better spot in the eight-final.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if Shakht'or doesn't win, but he can't rely on that, because with the same nine points, the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow (2:1) last week, will advance, but won in the first straight match (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe that they will reach the semi-finals in the reorganized Champions League for the second time, just as they beat them in the same match in the previous competition with a goal by Kaká in the extension (1:0) after a 0:0 state in the basic playing time.
To hope that the "rossoneri" will be Shakht'or, for whom he is worth a victory if Celtic loses, both to advance to the eight-finals and to stay in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and not having the opportunity to continue in Europe's top competition, could reach third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20 000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20 000 viewers since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver declared that their group's reconnection was "great."
About 20 000 people bought tickets to be present at the concert, which also included a video that depicts the history of the group, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time that a new album is being released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets donated to them by their husband "Posh Spice," British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place despite nervous Victoria banning him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she thinks about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to contradictions between us" caused the dissolution of a five-member group two years later, also signaled its nervousness in meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made up my mind," Chisholm said of the reunification of the group she dissolved herself nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled and we all love each other very much."
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with a Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival, an army of nannies was expecting them at the airport.
The five have a total of 7 children.
After a concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns about a new gas fight between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas prices, and so the risk of Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is routed through the pipeline through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is being closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The latest larger dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has caused a crushing fall in exports to Western Europe, sharply raising prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large proportion of them remain underused.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must control foreign employees'
The inspector said the Scottish Chambers of the NHS must improve checks on criminal records for non-European staff.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that Scotland's NHS does not have an accurate idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that other key checks were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested immediately after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June for personnel recruited from outside the European Economic Area.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of links to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK before his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside Britain.
The Supreme Audit Office President's report says, among other recommendations, that commissions should be guided by Criminal Records Bureau guidelines that help employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the personnel's records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report announced.
Mr Black said Scotland's NHS has in many ways coincided with its own pre-employment clearance policy, but also added: "Our report highlights areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the amount of foreign personnel."
President of BMA Scotland dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employee checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit an act of terrorism in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what additional value those comments will bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably also be higher because the commissions had trouble identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures for the NHS authorities in the Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely exercised.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently redesigning the policy and pre-employment control guidelines for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to handle this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in concert with health commissions, will consider the recommendation of the report and ensure that best practices appear in updated directives of pre-employment checks on all personnel - including the foreign one - it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division dominated film awards
Control, a biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has racked up five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Picture Award.
The awards also went to star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench has been named Best Actress for the thriller Notes on the Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig has won a Variety award for getting British film on the world stage.
The awards were presented at London's Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - has cost just 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic U2 album cover Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another awardee - because Julien Templ's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The badge for best actor was awarded to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of the Russian mafia boss in David Croenberg's London thriller Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of tough guys, won a Richard Harris award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
This fifty-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored.'
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury featuring filmmakers, actors and organizers of the festival.
Proponents and patrons of the Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants over membership in cells preparing an imminent attack on oil facilities as well as on clerics and security forces.
State television told the largest oil exporter that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on oil facilities in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response unit of 35,000 members to defend equipment since the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry's internal statement as saying: 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a "rocket launcher" that slipped into the ground.
She further said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to try harder to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and a U.S.-backed Shiite government that conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support royal families who control the government.
Militants - backed by the calls of al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
Also arrested was a 16-member "media cell" in Medina that was intended to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as non-believers and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more similar to the willful twin Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbit on similar tracks, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the run-down greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower rotational speed were sent by Venus along a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by storms and hurricane winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the planet for one year, offer a steady look at how Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford University's Department of Physics and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus began, like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police detain 'enriched uranium'
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material is being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for 1 million dollars (480 000 pounds).
Still open
Mitt Romney said it was not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters recorded their queries on video and handed them over for broadcast to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as a snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's debate on YouTube.
But questions and even answers this time reflected much on the state of the Republican Party toward next year's election.
It's unclear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, picked out clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the most powerful Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the disc when they heard something pleasing: the announcer recorded the pinnacles of consent when the candidates spoke of a tough approach at the border.
The hardest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who poked ahead in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two struggled especially fiercely when interviewers asked if any of the candidates would support the "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Supporting candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, the California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the congressman from Colorado, managed to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance of being nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps for the fact that they have started to sound the alarm because of immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least the candidates have roughly the same view of immigration: greater rigour at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears of poisonous toys from China and other worries with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertaries and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the conclusion that even though the Bible was his favorite book, he probably didn't believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another interviewer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the assumptions first in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said Jesus was too smart to run for office, thereby earning himself a laugh.
The battle remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul's loud merrymaking in Wednesday's debate.
The two have rebounded from the bottom because both wings of the party still cannot agree on more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the winning report on American size on his lips, blinking at both wings of the party.
This time, the party is torn and the result is far from unambiguity.
Labour's pain
Gordon Brown found a trap again to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is customary in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
There doesn't seem to be any orders sold, no bills in a Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked on.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would do without the discovery that some wealthy businessman had for four years masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of 650 000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by polls, there was hope that he would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly funny President of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once-dreaded Mr Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in driving and feeble judgment under fire.
Poorly thoughtful proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative miscare.
A trio of retired generals kicked off a riot in the House of Lords; they protested cuts in army spending, arguing that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many-edged gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and their former internal discipline watchman), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr Brown is inevitably heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point beyond which they find governance difficult.
The people don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually displace their distrust when a new group takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and he doesn't even have to be in office for long, this is a push away: the state government is becoming punchy, ministers start doing briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, because he cannot take the position of a new broomstick compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the records of the tax office are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as Treasury Secretary.
And although he was not directly involved in the Blairo troubles, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "ranks for money," voters can easily conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's difficulties are not as bad as they look.
Those rumblings aren't as terrible as the Conservatives make them.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or been downright deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest commotion around political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he didn't want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who might buy access to those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams's progress but did not know it was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly interrogated; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-seeker who learned of the tricky gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not yet involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, although the main part of the payments took place only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the job so far.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but diluted his determination by reaching for a proven tool, the commission to investigate the matter - led by the retired bishop and the judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding the permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of political party funding.
That would require Labour, who are in tight, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a devoted partyman like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back the electorate; and the only way to earn victory is without attackability and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally, the dorsal fins begin to flash excitedly around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is withering, predators have focused on the credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses, if other consumer loan options get infected from subprime mortgages, could reach $99bn.
The signs of tension are clear.
The number of cases of inability to repay (with more than 30-day payment delays) and depreciated accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable) is increasing.
HSBC reported last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market - also because of insolvent credit card loans.
But it is still early for panic.
There are still few written-off accounts and inability to repay.
According to Moody's, the 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost the entire percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws of 2005 led to a sharp drop in the number of reported bankruptcies that make a large portion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciation) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general terms for borrowers have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good maturity that shows how much consumers repay monthly from their debts.
And confidence in credit card securities is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% greater than last year.
Direct paths for the spread of infection between the crisis of subprime mortgages and the credit card market definitely exist: when loans for property in real estate dry up, consumers are rather indebted through credit cards.
However, credit card issuers look at cash flow rather than the values of the liability items, so falling house prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They can even be beneficial for loan providers.
The motivation of consumers to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their property falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards is shifted up to the list of priorities to repay.
Card issuers can also respond faster and more flexibly to more tumultuous conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid changes in the prices of liability items.
"It doesn't happen that one beautiful morning we just re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, financial senior executive at Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subprime mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt reductions push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud associated with former financial executive Enron Andrew Fastow changed their statement on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially blamed for seven fraud charges, when he and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves at the expense of their employers -- denied.
They were due to stand trial in January.
However, during a trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of the three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been on the front pages for two years that took time to issue.
In the United States, their case is one of the unsealed parts of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The allegations brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a hoax along with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner branch of Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a lot of Eron fraud that pushed Enron down the spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch zero, but our three Britons knew it was actually of considerable value.
The company under Kopper control bought the bank's stake in that branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper 250 000 dollars for the company's stake.
According to the indictment, Fastow reported deceptively that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in that branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers got 7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases to conspiracy to play his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month at a facility in Texarcana.
All three Britons were on bail of 1 million dollars, ordering them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country's seventh-largest company, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, it was no longer possible to hide billion-dollar debts or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse cut thousands of jobs, more than $60bn of market value and more than $2 billion in pensions.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their roles in the fall of society.
Skilling is in the execution of more than twenty-four years sentence.
The sentences over Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for a nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at US$54 million.
For some of Russia's rich, however, these are tiny to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them are interested in that many places because it's for a narrow family or corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Show, a four-day orgy of lavish consumerism at a mammoth exhibition center on the capital's periphery.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers built their stands, hoping that the freshly rich Russians would lure everything from mahogany-inlaid yachts to diamond-decorated car partitions, beyond which not even 50 Cent would be ashamed.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the clearly orange Porsche in the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but against us it's dimes and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
On the waves of oil, money is pouring into the Russian capital just like when Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 80's when some Americans got hugely rich and dragged to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi squabblers of the 70's and the Japanese in the 90's, the Russians become the world's most prominent spending.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, the conference of the luxury industry of Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH Group, drew in ideas about how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The International Herald Tribune is organized by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine's list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "specious" millionaires in Russia, whose assets in the sum give 670 billion dollars.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum threshold.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London's jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed, and men are all for a fortune."
When they walked in the evening dress on Sunday evening halls, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova described herself and her clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at those cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who covered herself in designer clothes like a veteran of the red carpets next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home-made put.
The fair seemed to be focused primarily on fresh rich people, brand-driven Russian buyers, who are willing to sit for several hours in road traffic, so that they could walk around the warehouse, which garishly mixes Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, tailor-made pool tables, apartments in Dubai, stuffed Gunds and drafts.
Members of the plain public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's painting from hand-painted blue tiles in over-life size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gilt."
And indeed, the local vendors say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from flashy logos to little-known brands of limited editions that would never have been shown at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, local general manager of King Koil beds, said he had sold two mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, after 70 000 dollars.
Also, on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, who equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his firm sold a clearly orange Porsche for 170 000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which on request adjusts luxury cars, that it has sold three bars for cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantomy after 55 000 dollars.
He showed the reporter a bicycle of a car designed for the Russian casino owner, who was wearing a Swarov crystal-coated string so that it looked like roulette.
Price: 22 000 dollars for four such.
"That Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-skinned bikes or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconium doesn't have to ride those bikes yet," Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll put them in his garage of thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing much exclusive, given the big increase in the price of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a stand run by the Russian firm Alliance Continental, which handles asset management.
The company erected four red British-style phone booths stuffed with a column of fake bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500 000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires' Fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to let friends take a picture with a mobile phone, resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or simply stuffing a pocket with a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
A death in New Jersey may have been caused by a spoiled operation
It was the day before the Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked from the big windows of the local restaurant A little healthier and watched the ambulance, who had come to the white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined in.
And then another.
"Then I saw a van of the medical examiner arrive," Mr. Livingston, the restaurant controller, said.
"At that moment I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the Newar police department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and hope that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness to the New Arkar police leadership.
Ms. Arroy was an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy's phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me.”
Mr McCarthy said Miss Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newar police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney of Union, Theodora J. Romankowa, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroy died from unlicensed surgery.
"It's one possibility," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at roughly three o'clock in the afternoon 21.
November and found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is supposedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh did not say if the authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
No one answered in the center of Miss Castro's house, with a damaged rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking at the back
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel of "Ethyl Vanillin" was in the open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroy had given him invaluable help in chewing through the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful with this or this,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came in, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing.”
Hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates are leading to a strengthening of world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm lending conditions by further lowering interest rates have been reinforced by the reassuring remarks of the U.S. central bank's deputy chairman.
The stock market jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernanko, chairman of the Fed, said in response to continued pressure in financial markets, the management must be "flexible and pragmatic."
As part of an apparent effort to calm irritated markets amid hints of reviving credit effort, Mr Kohn said recent arousals "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets towards the end of September and October."
He further stated that if increased instability persists, the possibility of household and corporate financial conditions will increase will continue to deteriorate.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh capital levies to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
Those remarks also helped reassure Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy when apartment sales showed record-low numbers in October.
The consequences of the financial whirlwind were underlined by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, 4% of its world workforce, in the context of cost-cutting due to compensation for heavy losses caused by a failed bet on providing inferior housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to be lifted in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed at 13 289.40, while the more used S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6 306.2, with the value of Britain's blue-chips rising more than 39 billion pounds.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets turned out to be in full force after the European Central Bank's three-month money package auctions, these funds were loaned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the most since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release above-standard money into London's money markets has increased, saying that the rates of Britain's three-month interbank loans "Libor" have risen after uninterrupted growth since November 12 to its maximum from the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who sticks to this post at best at borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help and because the table of Hugh Morris, the English team's chief executive, is beginning to fill with applications for the post of national collector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
Whoever will not be placed on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair, and sport at all.
It's not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the choice is challenging and requires an opinion that must always be subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if so?
We might ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and industry overview, should be promoted to the commission - the place is only for one.
Who's to say which level is right for the cricker if he doesn't get the chance to drop or swam to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but they have opportunities anyway.
In the team, the cricker has to catch the captain's gaze at the right time to see if he should take the wicket, and the batsman needs regular chances in the starting positions if he should ever impress as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the view of the collector is more complicated.
Last season, for example, there were many betters that James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first class at 33 runs on each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at the same modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
Whether he's going to play at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or reach the careers of both, or it may not have much influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth played Batty in every Test and served good performances, five wickets and 40 vacations in first class, but it was Paul Collingwood who was fighting for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test Cricter, who is additionally, despite having scored twice a hundred points against Australia against Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one further discussion following today's training session at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience over Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in first class versus the six Bopars, who is, at twenty-two, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah made just ten runs in two innings in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test at Lord's, his home court in Middlesex, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the picks when Vaughan wanted to cast him again for the next match, his firing seems to have gone away something of the vigor that was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex Universal has a joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket pitch, and his off-field behaviour symbolizes a recently overturned car with four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the English team's automotive sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he pulled out was his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-fast skid pitches on the local playgrounds, which seem to suit him, he gives effectively and he launches confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps it is the true art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to get Bopar his chance now, which I don't mean that Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he'll be the one to play here next weekend.
The buses bring the refugees back to work - and to the fight against al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, dumping refugees who had run out of money or expired their visas, and others hoping the city was returning to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
Mansour bus station was already outside Damascus, 800 people arrived in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Quabaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the newspapers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia militant cleric Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasem al-Atwani, a thirty-eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariya called him, saying the U.S. military's local militia, with the support of the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaida out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was driven out of his home in Sleikh, North Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"A few friends called me the day before yesterday and told me that he was rolling out an al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said sixty-two-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the appeal of calm in the capital after strengthening the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of biased citizens" who, with a gun in hand alongside the U.S. military, defend their neighborhood.
But more spoke of the fact that they were prompted to return by the obstruction of visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a fifty-one-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and thus prompt them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunnis have been pushed out of Shia regions and vice versa, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will again stir up sectarian tensions and lead to another fight.
Little Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state of Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
In only one educational area, Saarland is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears in Saarland on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which is in fifth place in monitoring the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Colleges have traditionally been closely cooperating with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
Which corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saar children are admitted to college - many of them even without studying at a grammar school.
"A professional education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's educational expert.
By obtaining more than one in five juveniles, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities of studying two disciplines are the second best in the whole of Germany with regard to the population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saar Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model taken over by other federal states.
If the results of pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
In conducting the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
In total, however, Saarland did not improve by as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of Saarland, the Pisa studies do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Saarland could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory in grammar schools - even though the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chavez shifts the clock
What not to see will go for hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will move the clock in this South American country back half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chavez becomes a ridiculous figurehead.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that the clock will be shifted by minus four and a half hours compared to the world time, according to the new law.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the U.S., reasoned that the United States forced the world to divide the time zones throughout the clock.
On Wednesday, Chavez announced that he was cutting back on relations with neighboring Colombia because of the hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can no longer because of my self-respect," said Chavez, who is pushing for a reform of the constitution that citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chavez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument was sparked by Uribe's decision to remove Chavez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels for the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision to "spit in the face," Uribe Chavez criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain, everyone talks about Chavez.
The new mobile ringtone here has caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet anymore?) - this is a sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was pronounced by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who was so upset by the left-wing populist's recent Ibero-American summit that he was silenced in this way.
Germans face lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of reducing real wages this year despite a strong boom.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to Hans Böckler’s Foundation, in 2007 employed people can actually expect to receive a lower wage than last year.
"The blame lies with a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," Gustav Horn of the research institute IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) told the daily Bild.
New burdens on employees may also be awaiting in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper that the planned reduction of unemployment contributions to 3.3% in this situation is correct and reasonable for the new year.
However, the Federal Labour Agency would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulty again, so that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the federal government, the newspaper of this social democratic politician was quoted as saying.
It was released on Tuesday that a price explosion of food and petroleum products drove inflation to its highest level in thirteen years.
In the annual comparison, prices overall increased by three percent.
Venus is the earth's hell of a twin
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar to that of Earth than previously thought. The European Venus Express spacecraft on Venus has recorded phenomena that also appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it was flashing on Venus.
Now the European Venus Express spacecraft has yielded evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. Lightning flies on Venus from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in the science magazine Nature.
According to the known theory of the origin of primordial matter, life could have originated on Earth thanks to lightning. The storms reportedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
It wasn't like that on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, something alive could hardly be found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Venus may be the earth's hell of a twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth and the size, has begun to evolve in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the Esa mission.
Since no probe has been sent solely for the purpose of studying Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express spacecraft in November 2005 was a milestone in the planet's research.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which have been brought closer to several articles by the journal Nature, did not just emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously thought," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind vortexes at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins considerably faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian institute Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second most internal planet in our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12 100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as Morning Star, or Evening Room, will orbit the sun in almost 225 days.
However, it rotates around its own axis much more slowly. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus surface temperature 460 °C and pressure 92 bar(abbreviation for bar?) It does not remind the Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water piled up on both of them. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to Earth in carbonates, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is demanding an end to party disputes over the Dalai Lama's acceptance in the chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's acceptance.
"We should not outwardly present ourselves as a nation that is not uniform on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universality for me," Köhler said.
While the Federal President stressed that everyone knew that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent Merkel from defending herself when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a unified China.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the Dalai Lama's acceptance, and was attacked by the coalition because of this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "showcase" foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's admission in the chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's acceptance was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions also located on the territory of China, is attempting to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that have broken out in France
Street fights with police, firefights, torched cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that have broken out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow in violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls.
The barricades were on fire, the rioters were shooting shotguns at the police. After the severe riots of juveniles in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is worried about similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful not to create a social tension that breaks out in violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
This does not mean just the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the conference on Islam, we have seen the first successes."
But caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
Over the past few nights, juveniles have fought hard street fighting with police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
The greater integration efforts of the German government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "immitative effect."
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be negotiated.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above-average."
First of all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We must give the youths hope."
The president of the Turkish community added that in Germany, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many juveniles from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we have to pay attention."
We must "quickly allow the juveniles to start working and educate themselves."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly peaceful.
There were hundreds of police officers in the deployment and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several set-off trash cans and cars on fire.
Since yesterday, approximately 1 000 deployed riot forces have taken care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel last night on Tuesday.
The following night, the riots of Toulouse engulfed.
The mess was sparked by Sunday's traffic accident, in which two juveniles lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the juveniles.
In the realm of Angela "Cloud"
The Chancellor’s reality is documented by the remote output, that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can expect nothing more from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her bleak, indifferent and contentiously poor speech in the general debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, administer.
Angela Merkel once replied in a very arrogant sentence to regret that she was overly focused on foreign policy.
That's provincial, she said, showing she didn't want to understand what critics were up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to all how much she deserved that regret.
Merkel was not even genuinely interested, let alone a sense of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblaková" presented herself: a politician who excels at others, who flees into foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it is praised without ceasing for the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but it no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such self-praise - so much immodestness would have been forgiven by the chairwoman of the CDU two years ago.
It is now confined to false phrases that could boost its popularity among humans.
With this approach, it harms its imij pragmatists, who do not need to flatter, because they solve problems.
But in the realm of Angela "Clock", internal political issues are a marginal issue.
Child poverty and the worries of people with low wages?
There are a few sentences left on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel, when it comes to child benefits, is reclaimed.
Three times Merkel has to start from scratch to say at least partially the right sentence.
Once things become too specific, it stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department Attack
The debate of Republican presidential candidates on Youtube has stirred up in fierce discussion in the case of favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already reflected in the first topic.
Mitt Romney tells his rival Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York a "retreat for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp regrets: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, throwing to the former Massachusetts governor that he was privately employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the attack. With the Republican base not yet having a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using those debates on CNN mainly to discredit their rivals.
Half-minute, Internet users recorded and through Youtube sent videos serve only as such help key topic.
"Exactly such a policy of isolationism has allowed Hitler to take power," John McCain tosses his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one pushing for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
The Vietnam veteran McCain is not spared by his regrets, nor is Romney for refusing to condemn the tormenting method of interrogation called "Waterboarding" in which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. They show Petersburg that the important topics of the campaign include neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong then," Romney explains contritely, asking the party base and TV audiences for his forgiveness for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed when he has to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in plainclothes for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistan's ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This concludes eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
President of Pakistan Parviz Musharraf took the presidential oath on Thursday, and will remain in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf swore that he would honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the U.S.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning from the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to the Attorney General of Malik, Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the demands of the West.
The country's highest court, which after the declaration of a state of emergency in early November occupied by his inclined lawyers, in the past week dismissed all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state 6. October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal region, and four others were wounded.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock are back
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group retake their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a haircut from the band's most successful period.
They were already more well known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three settled gentlemen, who initially look like they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt is sitting in the middle.
Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him, is on his left.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who bends over the synthesizers intently, is from the viewer's point of view to the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by accident, they will produce a traditional composition.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians very much.
Among the lovers of krautrock, the revival of the band Harmonia caused a considerable stir.
One thing worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not so familiar that someone twenty-three years will miss this band painfully.
But why couldn't even a German celebrate his ever-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when he values the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
When the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne band Can the Echo Award for their life's work in 2003, the hall was full of questioning glances from German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! during their speech, the audience was no longer amazed.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them on stage like an old friend during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at that time it was far from having the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name of Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar of the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramophone company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped with the band Kraftwerk, but he gained a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at that time was perhaps the most radical German band.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to to toil as a nanny.
It was more like life in such a spitzweg artistic being.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was supposedly found in a dumpster.
Much of it has been preserved by Harmonius.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following "De Luxe."
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting rascals didn't just serve self-knowledge.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been edited in front of a record-breakingly small, barely fifty-member backdrop during a concert in Griess.
At the time, Rothera wished that the members of Harmony would be trained and exercised occasionally.
It was a completely rude request for Roedlio and Moebia.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart."
The band Cluster came to life again in the 1980s and has been more successful ever since than Harmonia has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record company Grönland has taken the goal of cherishing krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The Physical Resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performances at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be Brit, Julian Cope, old punk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This outlined the overall influence of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "Unique true music, it owns the future."
There are paintings on which the producer with Harmony is in the peasant sednice.
The creation of the legend is also contributed by the projection of other black-and-white photos, on which are a set of instruments wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to extract those never-heard self-produced tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technique of absorbing punditters.
The choir of the House of World Cultures does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place, "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
We would find roots rather than in the blues at music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not be taken out of peace even now.
Even the most obvious is carefully thought out on the scene.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question will either deprive a person of his nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough
With the release of the films The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But neither of them is convincing.
The film's draft either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too moving.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can't prevent that at The Hunting Party.
The good news first: The war criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played in many appealing, non-serious roles in relaxed women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences eternally on the topic of Buddhism, you will take away the appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes Prey (Why do movie names have to be so long and tangled up these days?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could have become if fate and film business had not been so merciful: a man who, while having his best years behind him, still retains a certain remarkable charm as a ruin-like memorial.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters cinemas this week, is just a continuation of the endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can do a short trial: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television-shy film turns too early into shooting and action.
The film will remain something very similar to the series Cobru 11, without a highway, but for the war.
On the film The Hunting Party, it is possible to explore why a really good film has not yet been made about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who go after "fox," the Serbian top war criminal, could perhaps become a new "Apocalypse" at a different time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here's both Richard Shepard).
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes a road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be definitively written off after reporters in the film’s last five quick-form minutes do what NATO, the CIA, and all the hunters of the world’s criminals have failed in the past five years: to catch criminals and leave them to the righteous revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court in The Hague.
This film has a deeply human message.
He judges that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspects Americans and French (they are exceptionally united here) that they do not engage in persecution quite intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar, women attack the famous Brecht poem.
In it, it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "With compassion, I look at the swollen veins on the forehead, a note: how strenuous it is to be evil."
In films like The Hunting Party, they feature exactly the kind of swollen heads that indicate how strenuous it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of war in the Balkans.
It was recently reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were great failures.
There is only one thing to add: no good film about South Africa has ever been made before.
It almost always applies: When a star wanders around a crisis area or walks on a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, The Breaking Line with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films must apparently mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse" or "Lead Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then do not have the ability that is needed to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "Great dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcastically measured artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he declared: "The only thing that is that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust reaps criticism for renouncing Olympics
The mayor's resignation since hosting the Hamburg Summer Olympics has come across a fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
But Von Beust urges realism in his chances estimate.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the decision "in terms of business unfortunate."
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sportingly political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained with his earlier statements on Wednesday, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that in early December, the Sports Association would decide on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means for us that with a timetable for 2028, we have no realistic chance."
Still, this dream is not over yet, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) has described von Beust's remarks as regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to run for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is still too early to destroy our chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage," HSB president Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The waiver would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he made at the general meeting of the General German College Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg’s candidacy for the University in 2015 as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg University Sports Association has only just nominated for a candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg parliament has criticized the Senate for wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on holding the Olympics and the construction of the apartments has been ruled out," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD still planned the Olympics for Klein Grasbrook, saying the entire area would be used for housing purposes later, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor."
The retrieval of the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, crashed in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes
Whoever associates the terms Sweden and wooden boxes does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or yes?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his on the list of ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts a few months ago about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brill Boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disillusionment; the six "Brillo boxes" donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - like most of the other "Brill boxes" of the Stockholm type, which are in the international market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of art and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden crates that were based on the red-blue-and-white design of the paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but of their originals, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but these are not on display at Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of that time now speak of fifteen crates that rightly entered artistic and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned at auctions for more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that in 1968, approximately a hundred crates were made and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief conservator of the Moderna Museet, explored, in addition to the six Brillo boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brillion boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood boards were painted with the base paint and sanded, were painted with oil white with a brush.
On the contrary, it turned out from the structure of copies from 1990 that the paint was applied without a previous primer to the painting role directly on the plywood plate - in addition, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official list of Brillo boxes," said Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet, "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York comes to no other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six crates from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies."
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would address these "mijor accusations" made in the case of soap-powder boxes.
But the organization still remains in relentless silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila are giving up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered, fortifying themselves in a hotel in Manila, demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with a tear gas deployment.
For several hours before, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood trial for a foiled coup attempt in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers, who were supposed to be guarding him, apparently ran over to his side and joined the riot.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government's loyalists closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an urgent session of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government have called for large demonstrations to take place against the president on Friday.
Corruption has been blamed on her government for months.
The Manila financial region became the main scene of the revolt of about 200 soldiers against Arroy in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the revolt crashed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have tried at least seven times in the Philippines to overthrow a democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet secured more than twenty percent of the telecoms company Versatel.
The business announced on Wednesday that the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
There had previously been speculation about a takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg raised its stake in the company of this Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%, there were disputes about entry on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this money institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had almost 10% of the share in Drillisch, a mobile telecoms network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch gave an additional 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros to the sale.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought for 31.4 million euros by United Internet.
The companies discussed marketing collaborations in DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson explained.
In order to take over the rival company Freenet, the companies together established a joint venture of SMEs.
United Internet said on Thursday that the two companies would settle for a share of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and would not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 per cent of the business.
It is considered that companies are still keeping all options open, especially the possibility to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This already months-long and hard-to-transpense game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile network contract customers and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections at the end of the third quarter.
Holding United Internet and Drillische have so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It is now agreed that Drillisch will get approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed as early as August.
