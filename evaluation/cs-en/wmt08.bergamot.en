Inflation in Europe jumps over food
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is due to the constant rise in food prices in the first place.
November price growth in 13 eurozone countries was above higher expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg Bureau of the Union said.
The official forecast was only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian issuant, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate, saying that the reduction, along with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must “deter on inflation” so that it does not have to do business in this matter later.
In Germany, November’s inflation is a 15.3 percent record, rising from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent in Spain.
Inflation in the eurozone has swung up because of skyrocketing food and energy prices.
The term prices of wheat increased by 88 percent, and the soybean exchange rate has reached its highest value since 1973.
In 2007, it was also necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets rose 52 percent this year, and last month it cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump in 2008 from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5, but will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12 months will remain close to 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement has risen significantly after a prolonged stagnation as of early December, and has now had the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists the Gallup Institute has never measured so low – 13 percent support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference – because of the greater determination of the voters of the opposition – would represent more than a two-thirds (71 percent) support from the five-yield support of the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the party's certain voters, there are supporters of both camps one percent more.
The public opinion on the economy has deteriorated even given the previous low – never before the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be downright very poor, so high – 41 percent, while the next 46 percent is the situation is quite poor.
Families assess the change in their material situation after the spring and summer hopeful prospects now more pessimistic.
As for next year, a majority of the population counts with further deterioration and only a tenth of the improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents were judged, the most survey of the Gallup institute so far, that the prime minister is doing his job poorly than well.
The Fern Gyurcsány is trusted or highly trusted by 13 percent of respondents, while in Viktor Orbán the proportion of supporters is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54 percent, the chairman of the Fidesz movement, 27 percent.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be dealt with without changing the government.
While after last October's riots, the government and prime minister's remain for 35 percent, at present this share is only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) only seen a solution in the list of new elections.
For the interest in the referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation that the referendum would certainly come and the other 20 percent said that it would probably come.
By comparison, only 55 percent would certainly take part in the “parliamentary elections held this Sunday,” and another 15 percent are likely to take part in their turnout. The success of the referendum would be undoubted on the basis of the present intentions.
No 74, the fees at the doctor's office, and the fees for a hospital stay would say 84 percent, the fees.
If we look at the same shares only within the circle of people certainly promising their participation, then the introduction of the training, the fees at the doctor and the hospital's fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth underperformed by Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading triangle have maintained last year’s, on average 16 percent rise in the price level, with the difference that VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs trading triangle grew by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price was an increase of over a thousand forints.
As prices in supermarkets of food “flight” last December, the percentage was not so drastically, due to the former high base, there was not such a drastic increase.
However, it is certainly dismal for consumers that what they could buy last year for a price under nine thousand forints will not be done now for even ten thousand.
The consumables of the Daily Economy in the examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the live fish remained almost at last year's level, but they were very underpriced cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy seeds.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found kilogram bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Likewise, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca Cola in a returnable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, according to the consumer bin of the daily Napi Gazdaság Auchan, this year, it appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora seemed to be the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices featured in the consumption basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság raised by 15 compared to the prices of Cora last Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan increased by 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and lowest value of the consumer bin, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's lowest and today's highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was on average 1 480.
The average increase in prices last year cost 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by VAT growth last year.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the department stores evidently failed to decide how much price range they should determine for individual products, because they could not predict what effect the change in prices on consumption would have.
(If the tradesman plans the speed of circulation of the product poorly, he may lose a significant profit due to the price range adapted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year the rise in the price of the consumer bin of the daily Napi Gazdaság showed so extremely that the price of the most expensive bin was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest price difference was all 844 forints.
This year, the last difference did not manifest itself, the most expensive kosh now cost 1,630 more than last year, and also the cheapest priced by 1 284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, the disastrous price growth came to light, less than 20 months underpriced the number of daily consumption in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, does not completely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured, in the case of several basic foods, the increase in prices exceeding 30 percent within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, according to the daily economy consumption basket, this seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed a price increase of barely above 10 percent, due to the base even in the worst case.
According to all the stronger positions, flour suppliers occupy eggs, and they have managed to push through the drastic price increase in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trade gold triangle do not skimp, they are still reporting on a good year.
According to our experience, most of the customers in three shops are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything quanta, durable food is taken after salaries.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long queues at the ticket offices, or the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, the turnaround is lower in the countryside, several international chains are moving people out of the fact that sales lag behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions of hospitals, overfilling beds, overloading of staff do not help to stop the diseases, according to the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, it also saves on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after that he had to return with an MRSA infection, and due to the bacteria located in his body, one important operation could not yet be performed.
By this year’s December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistent disease agents were reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance system, Karolina Böröcz, head of the National Epidemico Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents have been confidently registered in hospitals, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicilin-oxiclin resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are worn by a third of people in their noses without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsilitis, leather infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, it develops from a bacterium that is very resistant to antibiotics and which is rapidly spread in inadequate hospital conditions.
Above all, in the case of temporarily or persistently poor functioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or patients in years, can cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning – sepsis.
According to the Chief Physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, a similar infection belongs to the daily practice in hospitals.
“Infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there,” said Tibor Nyulasi, “where the presence of the causative agent of the disease is not investigated.”
Resistant to antibiotics
“We are isolating these patients, the nursing staff is treating them in rubber gloves and in the mask, and we have the necessary antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first under investigation of whether it is present in their MRSA organism, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favorable for the prevention and spread of multidrug-resistant agents of diseases, according to Karolina Böröczová.
Since this infection occurs characteristically in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should check patients' admitted patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in vogue.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases are thus detected when the patient suffers from a perceptible MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate antibiotic treatment in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical history.
It is necessary to make it necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent resistance from drugs, but even hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Sampling of microbiological samples is even rare even rare in the basic or outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczová said.
The Recipients Are Disinfected
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most often through medical staff.
Therefore, it plays a very important role to wash hands and the use of gloves and masks, but even in this, there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but in the conditions of domestic hospitals it is not always possible to isolate the infected patients.
Rooms, on the other hand, are often overcrowded, beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, we can also encounter the fact that there are few in hospitals in unfavorable material situation, there are few patients, and many patients, which increases the chances of infection.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are followed, similar infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the disease cause can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it is being fought against everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has drafted a MRSA prevention program, or a decrease in its incidence.
As the program seems to be successful, according to published data, the MRSA infections in England show a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks among its priorities for the prevention of multi-resistent disease agents (including MRSA) or hospital infections caused by these disease agents.
Police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
An official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII district, who caused the fatal accident, is ready.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who had resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, spokesman for the High Public Prosecutor's Office of the Capital City Attila Morvai reported on Friday after an expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already stated that the former police captain had not had consumed any alcohol before he had sat behind the wheel.
The then director of the XXII Circuit Police Directorate knocked down on Lajos Kossuth Street in the XXII district on Tuesday with his own car while turning off a fifty-five-year-old man who stepped in front of him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian was crossing outside the zebra, after all, according to the rules of the road is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police chief resigned and asked for the transfer to the retired, according to the police's communication, because he was so shaken by the case.
In the matter, the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor General’s investigation is carried out by the Budapest Investigative Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain worked with prosecutors carrying out the investigation from the beginning.
Next 400 million euros per infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks worth a total of EUR 400 million to support the economy, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, was signed on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund, which has already concluded a loan agreement for CZK 100 million, the now-signed contract concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
The budget financing of projects related to education is also a loan agreement of 150 million euros.
The EIB approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the use of the remaining 150 million euros can be used later, with the expansion of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract, which will, in particular, be used by the University of Debrecens Research and Development Project.
There was also talk of the 4th metro route at the meeting.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original treaty needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB financed a total of EUR 113 projects in Hungary with €8.4 billion.
The interest rate of the loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment is tied to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering – the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is shopping for the still cheapest, but rapidly becoming the EU market more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular Eastern European destination for real estate purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
Of the mountains, the most in the course are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozobol and Nessebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country will sooner or later – for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and more and more interested parties are also shopping nearby in the country of the country’s inexpressive city of Rus.
Also, the capital Sofia is a promise of tempting possibilities, business and office space promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming a popular destination for trips in the next two seasons.
Predictable investors are buying in bulk, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyle.
Most of the customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also come from Romania.
Malt and Cypriot investors are also present, there are traditionally many Russian customers by the Black Sea and in ski resorts.
Foreign buyers are to be divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Established people buy either renovated real estate worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and possibilities of communication, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor, is important for them.
The second category is buyers of chats (Bulgaria ranked among the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium or long term.
The increase in real estate in the capital is continuous, or the demand is becoming stronger.
Bulgaria is the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but they have grown by 21 percent a year in the last five years.
The increase in property prices significantly exceeds the growth in salaries.
Fodor and Hungarian Six Percent
According to the information of the Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday, and after Wednesday's official opening of the international conference on climate control will continue after 2012 with the negotiations of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which is addressing the efforts following the period of emission reductions defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States also announced that it does not want to negotiate exact figures now, although it is inclined to reach an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020, given the 1990 situation.
Another big question of the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, the developed countries will also proceed to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are reliant on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Board, most likely under the World Environmental Protection Programme (GEF) at the United Nations – we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian six percent
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of the Environment and Water and Water Industry, Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain a leadership role in the global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of the “2012 agreement”, and is ready to commit to up to 30 percent reductions in the event that other developed areas of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibility and commitments corresponding to their possibleness.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set themselves the target of a 5.2% decrease target, with the then 15 EU Member States committing themselves to 8 percent.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our homeland will accomplish – it is recalled in a press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot going on in Bali, or within two years, it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term policy of climate change, otherwise its entry into force would not move until 2012. In this case, the commitments to the reduction set forth by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new system of emission reductions, the necessity of which, in its latest report, was also pointed out by the UN International Scientific Department on Climate Change – the IPCC, which is the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reductions and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
UK Army Recruites on YouTube
British military units are posting on a video-sharing site recordings from actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has liked YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006.
The recordings taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet are controlled by the Air Force Command of the combat operation in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of British air force soldiers have already made their way onto the Internet, and more than 75 thousand people have already looked at their “channel”.
The British Ministry of Defense registered in the spring of 2007 as a "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of actions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office and the international peacekeeping force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Air Forces have released videos according to their original intentions for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good at familiarizing the general public with the real goal of the presence of the army abroad.
“Promotion published in this form compared to traditional TV recruitment ads costs almost nothing,” defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, “but it necessarily carries a certain political message, or in a particularly way confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.”
The Americans made a game
The army is worried that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also on the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, “official” promotional films, officers talk at most about the losses, but the bloody form of the fight is not presented.
After all, many videos of the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the sharp deployment, but the British army has only now arrived at them.
Americans are recruiting a little differently – using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the side of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
There will be Christmas with a raffle and a padaine in the ministries
Labor Minister Monika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to pog and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere for the visitors with a raffle and toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the Swedish table – so the powerful – are fun.
The government is also preparing for Christmas.
The most costly ministerial Christmas celebration will be held by the Ministry of Defence this year, but it does not expect its employees.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, during the Mission Christmas they treat the family members of the soldiers currently on foreign missions, but they also hold a reception for journalists.
The resort donates 25 million to the atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves off the hoof compared to other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jövő Ház, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and from six hundred employees of the ministry is expected to accommodate three hundred and fifty guests.
The resort will stick to the Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and the raffle will also be drawn.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4 700 000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) – concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting a hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited for another Christmas celebration: a company will arrange the course of tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, because we were unable to reach the relevant person.
The suit is not necessary
The OIT building was hosted not only by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas organized the ball of St. Lucie.
But OIT did not want money from him for using its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the ball.
The party began with the greeting minister, after dinner it was possible to dance with the accompaniment of the music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, evening dresses or suits were not mandatory at all.
The Puritan party is being prepared by the ministries of health care, work and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400 000 forints in its own building.
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth even officially does not invite co-workers to the Christmas party, but at the final work meeting.
There are a hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will only receive coffee and promotions, so only 350 000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his co-workers will easily accomplice in the auditorium of the Ministry of Regional Government and Regional Development.
The Treasury Department (PM) will hold a Christmas reunion, at which 436 workers are waiting, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he devotes 2 500 fortints to the guest – the total amount includes a reception with the Swedish tables and toast.
Since the Minister of János Veres, PM workers celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be absent, the officialness will intensify not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Department organizes a New Year's reception on January 20, ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in the castle Vajdahunyadvár in the Municipal Courts and, according to the Ministry's communication, 1 000 forints per person are intended for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short greeting minister and end with a slight treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told the [origo] portal.
They were unable to communicate the price of Christmas celebrations of the resort in the press department.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Decorative Arts.
A huge strike is coming
The League unions, or the National Union of Workers' Councils (MoIZ), will on Friday create its strike commission to coordinate Monday's unlimited strike.
On Saturday, a protest public gathering is held, on Monday – on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act – work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious traffic disruptions, because the railway transport will almost completely stop and within 13 hours employees of the Budapest transport company (BKV) will also strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association will acquaint the League with the National Union of Workers' Councils with the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike committee of the LEAG – MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday’s action.
A protest public gathering is held on Saturday, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely, unless there is an agreement with the government.
This means that no deadline for an end to the strike has been set, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If the Parliament did not eventually adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for the strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next steps.
According to Monday's agenda for the Parliamentary Meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on only in the late evening or night hours.
Due to the Monday start-up strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: at the railway station, the work will be stopped for an indefinite period of time, in the morning part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of Volan companies can stop.
At the same time, half of the lane will also be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the call for the strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League Association website.
Some organizations announced a strike indefinitely, others declared a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people are travelling on the railway station at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the previous reports, the BKV will strike from the beginning of operation within 13 hours, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be held by the Union of Employees in the LIGA Energy Industry, and the 2-8-hour cessation of work was called by the Union of Educators and the Democratic Union of Educators.
The Union of Hungarian Physicians will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Healthcare Workers and the Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League association is that the government recalls the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept for a public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of counting pensioners valid from next year is gradually introduced.
Third, in order to ensure the pre-initiative of the early retirement for the relevant fields of work, the scope of inclusion in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), under the League Trade Union Association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country's Risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországhert movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division, the political risk of both Hungary and the entire region has increased in several respects.
In the “attention to the risks” developed by the company, it is written: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that “by focusing the ever-existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Romani peoples of Hungary, violent ethnic clashes” may occur in a short time.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is probably aimed at provoking such an action – the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: “Public discussion on the Roma issue was left to representatives of the representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Romani-Hungarian contradiction.”
This deepens the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts – the institute judges.
Moreover, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the Research Institute, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, “to a large extent spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, above all, in terms of belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity”.
The institute recalls: part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which have been getting more and more publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, is that several organizations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 that call themselves as “national militia” associations.
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while they openly proclaim – even the armed – readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of animal disasters, attacking the homeland, the disparage of order), moreover, with reference to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state,” he adds.
He also notes: all this happens in a way that seeks to wrap up the various political efforts to oppose society to politics and parties into civilian rofle.
Therefore, the emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups does not only serve to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, which is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-raising factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, they have been pointing to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, and the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighboring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policies by calling for the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so that the political risks for the area as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was created by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
Against the backdrop of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stands the mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
She took advantage of this BNU to start a guard, saying the organization's goal is a "national militia".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been “Gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained idle and indifferent, the institute of Political Capital recalls.
He adds that the initiative sparked a stormy discussion of the Bulgarian public.
As he further writes, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Romani organizations that it will create its own guard as a sign of resistance.
As the activity of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not impossible that even the Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warnings developed by the Institute of Political Capital.
When asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director of the political Capital Institute: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, the risk analysis is issued every year and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk alert.
Holidays are not all available
In Hungary, the days of leave are precisely set by law and have become a general practice that working days are shifting around the holidays, which awaits us fewer times next year.
In the European Union or in America, the holidays are not united.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and national holidays and days of rest.
Days of rest are mostly related to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a day of work – on the New Year, so that people can relax after New Year’s Eve.
During the year we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The National Holiday is March 15 celebrating the revolution of 1848 and 23. October, commemorative day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the foundation of the state, May 1 work, on November 1 and 2 we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two days of Easter, Pentecoco Round and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays according to the calendar rarely fall on the weekend, it has become a practice of moving the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after a free holiday.
The price for extended weekends is that the previous Saturdays we stay in the workplace and in school.
When the day that immediately precedes or follows the feast is being worked on, the Minister of Labour has been regulating the Minister of Labour for many years in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employed workers, to public servants and to persons in the public service.
It does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruptions or operate with regard to their determination even on rest days.
This year, there will be a change in the working order only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, or according to the previous trials, most people will “work” in advance the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, or thus take advantage of a saved holiday.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, or the end of the week, so that the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar turns around the Labor Day, so that the workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, may be a rest day.
The transfer is related to the holiday 23. October: Saturday 18. October will work instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of the year next year will be completely marked by holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost every nonstop holiday even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
A scare away of little things that you can give your colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we can hardly even notice: all this “environmental” everyday in the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or you will deliberately avoid gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for you from the marketing department,” a colleague will tell you.
Have you missed the meeting because of that?
In the best case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (this is less common solution).
Most often, a thing is resolved with one agility.
Before there is an embarrassing excuse, it is good to think about how you could prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously do to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that isn’t yours?
There's nothing more uncomfortable than when you reach for some kind of document, office use or for your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember you put a stapler on your desk yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or have you discovered your pen on the table of your colleagues that you considered lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues, otherwise they will be rightly angry with you that you are digging into them in matters.
Don't take envelopes or adhesive papers out of your office because it can be annoying when you run out prematurely, and you'll need them immediately.
Gossip about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the propagating gossip.
Who, with whom, what he did?
Where and why?
Don’t hang everyone on your noses about your colleagues’ private life!
When any of them share with you their innermost secrets, do not abuse his trust!
Lock within yourself what you have heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Do you report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and, citing a severe headache, you report your absence because you are not well, or you think that today you would rather rest, keep in mind that your work, urgent tasks and work, which they have a certain date, someone else will have to do for you.
Take into account your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or that something that can happen to be at home for, so that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Humour, Hiking, phoning
Have you immersed yourself in a job that will rudely pull you out of the hiring of colleagues?
Did you unnecessarily witness a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear?
Do not dissuade your co-workers by humming, singing, loud conversation (them overhead), or by stomping, constant accude, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be intrusive even when they are not prevented into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Don't call off any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you have made a mistake and someone paid for it, and correct the harm!
Ask how you could fix the thing, fix negligence!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Sweatpse and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but they do not fit in the office!
Do not wear leisure clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Don't be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in the running scenes - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a man wants to suit, he ceases to be interesting
In the usual morning congestion.
From the radio there is a special melody: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
Music changes the pace and the previous tonal coloring is added bass, then a female choir is attached as a real jewel.
At the station mr2 is a song by the group Zagar called Wings of Love.
Domestic musical life did not spoil us for a long time just with high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the constipation looks quite different because you're just listening to Zagar's new album.
The revealing of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture, and although there is again garbage rock in fashion with its beatings to the guitar, even the home electricop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five Churches and he also played in the Yonderboi band, except in the end – perhaps because two bagpipes do not fit into one of the devils – he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through when he was invited to composing film soundtracks (e.g.
The film of the Ferenc Török "Szezon".
His formation, playing in smaller clubs in the beginning, was recognized by a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album in 2002 among the fifty most important domestic records, debing Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic subjects determining the development that could be marketable in the West.
Zagar and his band are without a doubt “on course”, although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The band responded as it should: they made a new, better album.
The now-positioned album Cannot Walk Fly Canto be released by the Point can open new paths to them, although the name itself seeks to create a follow-up with initial flights in the Five-Jewellery.
This is one of the verses from the song of the old band Balázs Zságer.
Reference to the essentials, flying would be appropriate, but next to the essential touch of this music now appeared – in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time – the more louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, presented himself at the premiere of the album at Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music lately from morning to evening, began to show us sweeping melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six home-grown singers (Underground Divas".
All right (?)
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much does what you play remain with marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition fringe music doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not an alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they say nothing, and so it can only be created for the sake of sales, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can stem from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude, as it is accepted, also works, regardless of the language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are concerts not only teenagers and people in their twenties, but also older.
They are much more watching the transformations of light music running around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care about who, where and in how much of your music he listens to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more at concerts, where the mutual influence already works, but it lies only in the unfathomable changes of the moment.
Still, I've ever seen that if you want to suit the audience, from that moment on, it ceases to be interesting.
Hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the Yonderboie example?
He works solo and built his career more from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, regardless of the fact that our music sometimes try to explain.
We are more like team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was impossible to avoid our work not to be compared to the songs of Yonderboy, several of us would separate from his band and go a different path.
hvg.hu: In the top list of the station mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love came first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open up to the wider stratums?
B.Zs.: We didn’t plan to write a hit to sell the album.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more incomprehensible themes.
hvg.hu: How did you pick the six singers?
Why is it – what was the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of putting this choir from soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
That’s how this six-member choir – Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Boris Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – which we then rechristened the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly how you intended the song, or did the girls reimage something about it?
B.Zs.: The song had long existed in the instrumental version, when the material came down to the record, we thought there would still be something needed for this song.
He tempted the sequence of chords to be joined by a singing party.
That night, I sang a melody on him that night, which the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time and very spontaneous.
I remember it getting alive, but of course it needed Wonders.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert seemed to be the girls in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together, and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't accompany their singing.
They were standing on the stage in the back.
That intentionally?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting our ego a little bit, where it is, where it belongs, and just let the wings of love uplift.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would feel the others.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the compilation of music, not even once, the heavier pieces occurred more in the mixing.
For example, Dorian Grays Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock-realist-backed Goes To The Girls, where groove did not want to function for a long time, then everything slowly found its place as in a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is always changing by the fact that I have "let" the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Treacherous broker risked billions of inferiority
A treachery defraudant.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka, refers to his beloved employee Jerome Kerviel.
It lost almost five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he made up his timely crisis in the U.S. mortgage market.
"It's mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent him to the police.
But as Kerviel’s testimony brought by French media, such as Le Monde, was a person who had profits of 1.6 billion euros from his trades at the end of last year.
The Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in his testimony.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros on the U.S. crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
However, this crisis did not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet it right.
At the end of the year, his profit climbed to as much as 1.6 billion euros.
"When I earned the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn't keep anything to himself.
In the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that he was not discovered.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his business.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come to him?
It's not more.
"I thought it would satisfy them if only the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the will to take so much risk?
He had to work his position up.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a separate broker with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
Still, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“Even during my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after taking it up, the first great success came.
Thanks to stocks, Alllianz made money, as he bet half a billion euros in the bombings on London for the decline of this title.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses knew everything, or rather, they knew.
"Should I make money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the blow earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to obscure it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I only chose four days for the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a holiday is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech Government Ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will be directed to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational program and represents up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
In the current drawing of EU funds, the Czech Republic is still among the least successful in the newly admitted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for ex-president Nicaragua confirmed by court
An emergency petition in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former country president Arnold Aleman, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud reaching $100 million.
However, he was later released from prison and was under house arrest in his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at the moment.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether they will let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
The court proved to Alemán four years ago that he regularly moved the government's money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fancy and accounted in fact to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Aleman founded to finance his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved the budget
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed last year with the support of the ČSSD because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies, although the most influential, calmly passed the law in peace.
It's a paradox.
Each rule begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government's power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more personalally grateful and therefore much more attention is paid to him in the media.
The quarrel of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the austere numbers.
State budgets in past social democratic governments suffered three ailments, which the one for 2008 is not able to solve at once:
The first is a high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandatory expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and the KSČM before the elections before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the ailment of the first.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. the deficit of budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is the deficit of budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, to obtain additional resources for investments, often recklessly issuing bonds that unreasonably indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass sale of shares of energy and other power grids, which they received from the state from privatizations.
They no longer have this source.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting the ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state was becoming more and more indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were much more sensible than our republic.
It is a huge shame that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have completely unnecessarily swelled to gigantic proportions in recent years.
Even if part of the nonsensical populist spending agreed before the elections has been abolished, then if the threshold of retirement and pension reform is not shifted in the near future, then in fact any policy in this country will end and whoever governs it will be a mere office.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributitating most of the taxed money for pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the extrusion of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
The planned deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments failed to manage what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not want the fact that the ruling politicians become just officials, then we must be patient and indulge in this not very strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get in taxes and fees, calmness to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis together against the financial markets.
More than a hundred billion dollars will reach currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the bank auctions the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send forty billion dollars to the auction, then making the European and Swiss central banks available another twenty-four.
This is after the attacks of September 11 for the first time that the central banks of individual states have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Bauman of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baummer added in its report.
Banks have already lost sixty billion dollars due to non-payment loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect even more billions of dollars of losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what else may come when they have decided on this procedure," said ABN chief economist Agro Kieran Davies.
"Looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend to their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with possible effects on economic growth around the world.
Central banks have thus decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about borrowing money, even though central banks of the US, Canada and Britain cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank’s move will contribute to the easing of the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Economists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is supposed to hurt developing countries the most.
President Vaclav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been brought about at the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he said that the debates of ecologists are unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech president emphasized that her topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so engaged for them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter cartoons of my opinions."
Now, therefore, those interested can read his undistorized attitudes.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but in his opinion he has enough preconditions to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
The main conclusions of the book have been the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no same opinion of all scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When asked by those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "derogatory protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefit."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver's license did not replace 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not manage to exchange an old driver's license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities still manage to issue a new pass by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would go on the road after the New Year without a valid authorization.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a far decline in interest in the exchange of a driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are overeated by applications and the interest in replacing the card has risen this week.
The municipality has about 2000 clients a day.
Waiting in the queues for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not exchanged their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new card takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who fail to exchange the licence by the end of the year and will go out on the road without a valid driver's license will be fined from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can also deal with the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will be CZK 2500.
According to earlier information, a person who is not going anywhere could be fined the town hall.
He could also pay 30,000 crowns.
Earlier, the ministry called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum of a thousand crowns fine.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, tens of thousands of fines are not imminent to anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document for which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not an ID card that every person must have a valid one.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is enough to take it away or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
At the end of the year, the cards issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
Motorists also need to gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the cards issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court Reduces Punishment to Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of a criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
This was finally decided by the Prague High Court, which reduced their sentences by one year and the other by two years.
Originally, detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime were threatened with 14 and 12 years.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but he is only waiting for a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences in total exceeding 16 years.
He couldn't get any more.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of robberies, the High Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have refused the indictment since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police, in agreement with Berdych, handed over information from police sources to criminals, covered individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent of it from the magnifying glass for Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment is a gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
Particularly about robberies, whose victims often suffered serious bodily harm, but also about the abuse of the authority of a public official and illicit arming.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel core bullets, a laser aimer or a submachine gun.
According to the allegations, the gang received tens of millions of crowns in robberies.
In addition to nearly twenty men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men from around Berdych are still in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to justice.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are residing in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a final decision regarding their extradition to prosecute to the Czech Republic.
Account for the substitution of children: 12 million
For the substitution of children in the maternity hospital, the lawyer of the damaged families, Igor Veleba, wants compensation of CZK 12 million, plus court costs after the Třebíč hospital.
For each of the mothers of three million, for fathers of two million and for children of a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The lawyer of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore fundamentally disagrees with the proposal of Veleba.
"We reject such a demand, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order to make up our minds about the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the opposing party has commissioned.
We'll find out if it has any meaningful value at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
He served as the basis for the negotiations on compensation expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents of children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatrists, suffered psychological harm and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they were faced with remorse that they had not prevented the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, are harder to cope with the news of the trauma and what is happening right now, the content of Veleba summed up.
Veronica and Nikola were exchanged by nurses in the Třebíč maternity hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the Governor of the Vysočina Vystročina, handed over 100,000 crowns to reimbursement of expenses incurred by the fault of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is establishing.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damage.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can apply for the assistance of the founder.
So far, the courts have granted people relatively low compensation, the sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup loses the Kingdom of Wallachian
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the Wallachian King first used the designation, but the project was built by a long-term work by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor.
Soup did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitize the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone remembers the words of the Wallachian Kingdom that is the actors and comedians.
Harabiš has the same opinion.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Raising money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something out of it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the designation Wallachian king first used Polívka on his TV show.
In 1993 it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, it was not related to the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionist event turned out to be a trade and a lucrative business, which Harabiš then followed the establishment of the Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to give his name and signature in passports and even offered their discount holders while visiting his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš merely used the bare idea that Polívka published in a mane for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka of the project of the Wallachian Kingdom certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, which was intensively devoted to it.
Cooperation of today’s disputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition of the "king of Boleslav I. chosen for the still".
At the instigation of Harabiš, singer Jarmila Šuláková took the lead role in the kingdom as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was rejected by the court today.
Clarity could bring Harabiš a forthcoming race for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He did not want to reveal the details and date.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Polívka can easily apply," Harabiš added.
Peugeot test 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
Honestly, I've never fanned the power of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the shifting, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the station wagon called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the space on the head in the rear seats.
The case is over, because the karoster of the station wagon means that even two-meter longhorns will not suffer in this direction.
Flying the world
I will pass the interior very quickly so that I do not repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where I have the only reproach to the poor center tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a bit more design invention when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
In the space, there is also an increase in the dimensions of the body.
The already mentioned lack of space overhead disappears in the station.
Suitcase suitcases
The main thing about this car is his luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (even thanks to the tilting rear window) and as decently compact.
Deaf spots are equipped with restraints, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched and at the same time it can hold even heavier objects.
But let's pause each other over the volume.
According to the tables in the basic arrangement, this is 428 liters, which is more of an average value compared to the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a much noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 hp in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the sixteen-hundred, which drives the family hatchback, should look like.
She's quiet, she's having little consumption and, above all, she pulls.
If I compare it with the Skoda equivalent, which sometimes feels like she has a cramped rag into the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
The price list will tell
The price of the car is not folk.
However, we must remember that we have tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a petrol for a petrol for 329 900 CZK will still be fined.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment then throws the equipment for another 80 000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic shuttering of wipers, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs everything 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the additional equipment at Fabia and you'll come to a lot of similar numbers.
So there's nothing left to do but decide the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
There is a growing number of children in British schools from Eastern European countries, which raises concerns for local settlers about the further development of local education.
Meanwhile, the integration of Eastern Europeans has encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous people are growing into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants begin to rise.
Quarrels, bullying and brawl between the students have also been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham police detained a Slovak woman who was hit by an iron rod beat a ten-year-old pupil.
The guilty defend herself that the boy insulted her with racist sullens.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, some boy climbed the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop it, he swung apples and pears at us, and then he revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils told The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even called the disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools among local and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70 thousand Slovaks registered in Britain who headed here for work.
About 30 thousand Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island of the Caribbean
It is really an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation can be accomplished if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
On one island, however, you will find much more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure compartment that the Spaniards in America have been looted and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 20’s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially under Prohibition) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were there.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses were built, along wide boulevards, cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 50's of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had a yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls in the Bodeguita Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive hotel Nacional, they will mix you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And the iconic cars from the 50's still drive around Havana, because once imported giraffes and fiats in that salty and humid air have long since rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is very dilapidated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the vicinity as there.
Other places also turn into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development has a green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but especially on Varadero, the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more fondness, which is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by train drivers.
The cane from the large plantations was transported to sugar factories on narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines, whose contour lines are only in museums.
Where to go?
Most visitors to Cuba will not miss the most places.
And so there's not much need to be written about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind that in the aforementioned Hemingway homestead there is a museum and who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
Valley Viňales One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viñale Valley in the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows from limestone subsoil.
Mogotes, limestone homos and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has caught on in their cavities, which makes the weathered rocks covered with thick vegetation.
The valley is the place where the finest Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final form if you visit one of the Havanian factories for the production of cigars.
Maybe someone finds it interesting that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth has become reincarnable into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that even in the 50's of the last century there was no road linking the region to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him to stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing crashed, everyone was glad to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time for Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth a look at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening, you will go to Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and the music falls silent in it in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is the prettiest on the island.
Such an opinion is influenced by the path itself.
Both roads that run there from Guantanamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and pass through nature, almost unknown to human activity.
The eastern outpost of Cuba was recorded by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and down the hill, where the former castle and today's El Castillo Hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about the Sierra Maestra Mountains, about the Bay of the Coils and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Cabinet Tropicana, the sanctuary of Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, African religions, which are professed by the descendants of former slaves, all of which could be described many pages.
But, as they say, better see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few troops and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should outline a concrete plan for next summer.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are now discussing further plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to be more active, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The next one is to allow the people to start the further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defense Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is the highest in five years, according to U.S. military data.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
"We're going to have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I am not happy with what we have in the land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of a three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been disputes among the countries involved in recent months about whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for passivity.
“Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands on them are not as high as we do in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid Sun labeled German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghanis slams revealed: Germans play while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild went on a counterattack and imprinted a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is over 84,000 crowns.
Total debt increased to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The national debt of the Czech Republic increased to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it has increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October today.
For every Czech, the debt is over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could not exceed the trillion-kilometre threshold until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told news server iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, sees it the same: "We could get to one trillion to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't anticipate this change," he said.
Debts are rising
The national debt consists of the central government’s debts and arises primarily by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal indebtedness of the state has so far increased by CZK 38.5 billion to CZK 719.4 billion this year.
So far this year, the state’s foreign debt has risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called traded sovereign debt at the end of September reached CZK 803.3 billion and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
“The total debt increased by 13 percent year-on-year for the first to third quarter, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade with when there is pension reform," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The strategy of financing and managing the state debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It is also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
Woman to appear in court in Khartoum today for giving her name to a teddy bear
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to a fifteen-day prison on Thursday evening, as her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting the six to seven-year-old pupils give the plussay tsaine the name Mohammed despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet Islam is forbidden.
She was sentenced to a whipped-bear ban.
The British fifty-four-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested in her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Department of Education.
Our story begins in fact already in the month of September, when the teacher in question asks their six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
"Eight names will be heard from the children's mouths, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the headmaster of the school, Robert Boulos.
After voting takes place in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children will eventually pick Mohammed as the most popular name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all it is a widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a teddy bear accompanied by the caption: "My name is Muhammad".
The bear himself had no label on this name, but the problem is in the very depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim woman who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knows her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret asking children to vote for a name," according to him, it is only "innocent misconduct".
Such an opinion is shared by many female pupils who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "very in the classroom they do not speak of religion".
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most commonly awarded first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name often selected by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often granted to the firstborn).
What are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them to a toy?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome different views of the future status of this separatist province.
“It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement,” said European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to keep peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations.
“We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult time,” he added, adding that “it is evident that the situation is tense.”
Negotiations close on December 10
Negotiators of the Troika, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last go to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent is Albanian-speaking population, could turn out in a brighter light as of December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, not far from Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, entrusted the troika with new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to close on December 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked the granting of Kosovo to the UN Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations after this latest deadline.
"Russia has been and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under the supervision of the EU to be a single viable solution.
Pristina declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement," said the president of the Kosovo self-government, Fatmir Sejdiu, at a Baden hotel, where from Monday this "negotiations last chance" took place.
Hashim Thaci, a former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and the future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plan of autonomy introduced by Belgrade "belongs to the past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the province's unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is said to be particularly worried about the "dominal effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 90's.
"But this does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally possesses the right veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
“For Serbia, only a solution arising from the Security Council is acceptable,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"These negotiations took two years.
It has to end as she began: on the floor of the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu, replied that "The last word on the status will have the Kosovo parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking residents, it would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush has claimed a deal on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his instigation, U.S. President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He clad that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas have agreed to open negotiations with the intention of once and for all resolveing a 60-year-long dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace contract" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures," and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush declared, recalling the duties for both sides stem from the "travel map" to the peace they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief of staff stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim to "conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all undecided issues without exception, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future border of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven in the 1948 conflict from their homes on the territory of today's state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the US president and emphasized that the subsequent negotiations be "total and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, saying he mentioned "Jerusal, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Olmert then spoke at the stands, expressing the opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it was necessary to "work itself to be concluded during 2008".
Bush determined the end of 2008 as a date for the realization of its "birth-state vision," Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it had made a commitment from Bush in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a cross-border in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights the roots of the conflict and against its central aspects," Prince Saudi judges in an interview he gave to one Arabic-speaking diary shady Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small messages from the black chronicle, the official versions do not coincidate with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car passed on Monday shortly after 17 a.m. Louise-Michel street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the mode of intervention, but it was on patrol and drove at 40 to 50 km/h, it did not have side lights on," explains the police source.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore without the right to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, drove "very high speed".
"The motorcycle slammed from the left side into the police car after he did not give priority from the right," one police officer clarified.
The test of the promile of alcohol in the blood carried out on the octal of the vehicle proved negative.
The condition of the car (threw by the front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) is indicative of the sharpness of the impact.
Marie-Thérèse de Givry of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) responded very quickly, and yesterday morning she announced that she had entrusted IGPN with the investigation into the "actions of unintentional manslaughter and failure to help those at risk", which is also taken in by the direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (director of the regional police).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation led by IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
According to the clerk, three witnesses to the accident, who were interviewed on Sunday evening, confirmed "a version of the police officers, namely, that the mini-motorbike approached them relatively quickly from the left".
A greed, no doubt caused by friction clipping on the ground, yesterday showed that the two vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles were secured and will pass technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a quick rumor among people that police officers should have quickly left the scene of the crime without providing first aid to two youngsters.
The IGPN should have excluded "any serious offense" at this point in all caution.
“This is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more searches and with which it is necessary to be very careful,” the police source said.
The diary of "Liberation" met with an eyewitness to those few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads right where the accident took place.
“Immediately, together with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, we ran down to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
We couldn't do anything."
He then saw a "corliating, completely terrified police officer.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke to the phone.”
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and certainty of those present that the situation of the youths is hopeless, the police were taken by the car of colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police officers".
They also massaged the heart, but in vain.
"Let no one say that the police authorities did not come to the rescue of the youths.
These young men were given first aid.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them,” the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions in Pakistan rise
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of the state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken as part of the state of emergency, tear gas grenades were injured, which, according to witnesses, were used by riot police.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where officers attacked and injured lawyers.
A few were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Accessory streets to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning in order to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong alliance of Muttahid Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "to urge the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who sworn off before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is a direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in an indirect presidential election that took place on 6. October.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the official said in The News.
Parvez Musharraf’s promise to give up the leadership of the military and become a civilian president,” said Deputy Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform until November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that the deputy head of the army should have ordered President Musharraf to be house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies still make up unexpected
This calculation includes an unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly arranged.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study conducted by the French Institute of National d'études démographiques (Ined) - State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of so-so-. Neuwirth's law, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes an unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly arranged.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, Ined estimates.
After all, the enactment of contraception allowed better "feedance control," the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years old was down from 5% in 1970 today to 60%.
Finally, eight births out of ten today are well-planned.
One pair of five has a birth even calculated for a month accurately and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of the baby.
Remarkable repair of the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed more than seven hours in space to remarkably repair the torn solar panel necessary for the station's further scientific activity.
It was a risky ascent into space that set records in terms of duration, the distance from the residential modules, the speed with which it was planned and the rates of "do-it-yourism" that the astronauts spent on the repair.
Difficulties emerged on Tuesday, while astronauts from the planet Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see frame).
This module is a kind of lander for modules-laboratories.
However, they need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move the seventeen-and-a-half-ton module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so that it anchored at its final habitat.
After it was moved, the crew began to decompose the sixty-seven-meter solar panels of the module.
And in this, one of the panels, distributing as a pulling harmonica, as a result of the pinch of the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
The unfolding was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control output on the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel, whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, added to the arm of the station, and carried out the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" of the U.S. Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tady, sturdy, very maneuverable, has a very well-crafted chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "surprised" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the defective cable and fixed some "floors" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the countervailing chamber, and also from inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey-on-suit-covered tool to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, invented and "underhanded" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely unfolded and then invented his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts are returning to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the company operating in the aviation and defense industries announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to face a delay in the A400M.
EADS has lost 4% and is now at €21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The financial group was forced to reconsider its projected production results for 2007 due to delays arising from slow advancement of the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition for the inaugural flight.
The price for alleviating delays in the supply of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated "to 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, more than a billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European EADS designer announced.
Due to these costs, EADS, next Thursday, at the presentation of its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new outlook for interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS's production results in 2006 fell 86% mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the giant A380.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft would be provided to the French army in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's election will take place without tense expectations: Russians will majorityly elect the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming, after the end of a very little free election campaign, its gravity to stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate a pre-recorded televised message to voters on public broadcasters, the content of which, however, is kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which seems to celebrate the crushing victory.
When he received the ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president did not let anything come out of him and was satisfied with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We are familiar with the award of true democracy and we wish you an honest, most transparent and open choice, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not nearly the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there have never been such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin."
After repression accompanying last weekend's demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, he continues to ban visits, according to his lawn.
'The Russians remain the homo sovietic mentality'
In the background of these parliamentary elections simple tense expectations, two far-opener questions are profiled:
- "Who will become Putin's successor in the presidency?
The official paper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will triumph over the whole line in the parliamentary, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have remained the mentality of homo sovietica, they do not feel the masters of their destiny,” said sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg notes the more distant context: civil society has gained, in this country christened five centuries after Europe, delayed; that the glorious common spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic well-being," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "volubernarily giving up personal responsibility", which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why to think about?"
This phenomenon applies to all social strata, including the business world.
Even the caretaker elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion Tamary Čeredničenko, a fifty-four-year-old professor: "Why to think about?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
Burdened memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which depict the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are opening up to the public.
47 million archival documents stored in the length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible by this time only for the "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven states tasked with the management of archives - among which Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow you to examine "particularly the transfers of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of the workers' health," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or the mental afflitic of some victims of deportation.
Registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding the deported or forced labour subjected to civilian citizens, to bring them proof of their internment in order to open the way of their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
“Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents,” prof said in 2006. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in Berlin’s Technische Universität.
EU and India want to achieve a free trade treaty in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade treaty in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath have announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to begin negotiations to sign free trade treaties (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India already amounts to almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India, according to the European Commission, is the ninth EU trading partner.
“The free trade agreement is tremendously misleading the two economies,” and “India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner clarified. The Asian and European giants together annually exchanged "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services," Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to New Delhi, said this week that the bilateral trade "has not yet achieved its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barrosa.

English bank takes note of concerns and offered £10 billion in five-week auction
The English Bank made it clear on Thursday that it intends to alleviate the current concerns that the conditions in the credit market will deteriorate again and announced a £10 billion bid in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer valid for an unusually long time.
“In an effort to ease the concerns that the conditions in the financial markets will be very unfavourable by the end of the year and give banks more certainty in the way to secure its cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” she said in a communiqué.
The bank specifies that £10 billion (€14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 1215 GMT until 10 January, at a base interest rate.
This is the first time BoE pumps cash into the financial market in a five-week open-market operation.
Normally, they last a week.
BOE adds in its communiqué that "it remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates on the same level on the monthly basis" of interbank loans at the same level at its basic rate.
The interchange rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest figure since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the English Bank associated with the fee rates that have deterred banks from using this offer.
According to some speculations reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate against the euro, many preferred to opt for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for Popular Movements) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Center) refuse to address the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on the purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs on Thursday refused to discuss the individual paragraphs of the Socialist bill on purchases, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
On the agenda, the text of the bill came to the agenda within the so-called socialist "needz card" (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and included a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which there was an increase in the premium of employment by 50%, the resumption of fluctuations in the TIPP, the transport check or the regulation of rents.
Given that UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate that became an opportunity for an opinion exchange, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television appearance on the purchase of purchase.
The head of the MPs, Jean-Marc Ayrault, has announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Bill, which the House will discuss next week.
A new festival is being born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is setting up a new festival, this promoteor/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Republic Festival, British organisers Melvin Benn, announced.
“It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination destination for campers.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most adlections of festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80 000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licenses and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury a "most inspirational event" ever experienced and says his company and firm Melvin Benna are working simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
“Originally, we chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, due to the current leadership of the city, we got bogged down in politicking, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to start a great festival in a special place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrendered the Lollapalooza festival in the Chicago Grant Park in 2005, after they excelled at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to 9,8M$ and 11,3M$.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in the green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impression of a rural festival in Europe and the city after the American one.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The municipally of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to divulge the terms of the agreement, but he argues that "that they are advantageous enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival it will have, hopefully, a long-lasting time."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to the Bonnaroo Music Festival's capacity in Tennessee, which accommodates 80 000 people.
He says that the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just put into the press.
“Wineland will have a rock touch, but the music there will be varied, so that we can attract a wide range of spectators as much as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
The C3 partners, which received the Top Independent Promoter award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuapon mission is one of the tasks of a delegate.
But his mandate is "politically challenging" because California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fit the "Guvernator" in the claws?
"We need to be careful, it's industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider the best," he said.
Hunting for festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all the West Coast festivals, whether it’s festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, it will be about presenting Quebec films, drawing attention to them and ensuring that the hosts give interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be unveiled at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be unveiled in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also introduced four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a marathon on the stock exchange at the end of the year? Experts divided by 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors are already holding hands on me expecting a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Bank Banif believes that "in terms of statistical terms, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange."
However, it is not appropriate to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially since, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, some doubts."
These experts do not anticipate that the stock exchange will move in recent weeks of the year, stating that "The stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of safeguards with guarantees, especially the fixed income affected by the effect of turnover to quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "particularly because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates (Federal Reserve System) is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of stimuli to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that there is no time for bold statements that there will be a marathon.
“There is not much reason to be happy,” the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end a year closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio regrouping and traditional pension deposits that occur every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the long weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are getting closer to technical levels and "that's why we could observe a reflection of the index, caused by reports from the US on the consequences of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will make sure they bring the Ibex to the new maximum quotes.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "This year's series is on strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it occurs.
“The ACS has been regaining its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as. Ferrovial and FCC will go the same way,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also do very well, even if they are not very represented in this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of declines in two cases.
The real marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock market ended the crisis triggered by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained back 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth-grade year (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two Hundred Branchs of Popular Bank Will Be Open 12 Hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most-storey parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to choose to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 a.m. and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that has also assured several times that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches has not yet decided to take this step.
In the meantime, he plans to conclude an agreement with the unions to abolish the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not to the public.
The results of this experience of Popular will be crucial for other entities to join or not to join the initiative, which supports the opening hours of trades.
This is the goal of the project set by the Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places to go to their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, sole traders and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new branches, but only an adjustment of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches that it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This supplements the extension of the opening hours with a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
Ángel Rivera, the bank's chief commercial officer, assures that this restructuring will not mean a big investment, but more hiring, as it switches from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with spaces for meetings of small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested the initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches in the streets of Madrid Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía were selected, and Rivero said it seemed to be a happy choice.
The Popular Bank currently has 2 500 branches.
And another 60 specialized immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where many of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't mean to compete with our clients', Rivera says.
They just agreed with Telefónica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time on the stock market
We did it.
In this sentence, Paolo Vasile, executive chairman Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of trading, when he stated that the television he was driving doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I'm sorry is that this did not happen because we would increase more, but because we have fallen less,' he declared.
And yet, he stressed that, thanks to the weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday by shifting 2.54%.
This profit has shifted their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the stock exchange value of this mediaset-controlled firm (52% of capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) amounts to 4 488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.5% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% overall since January, having half the value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of other telecommunications firms that have been valued is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million Prisa (Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasil, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
A relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in the viewership'.
Telecinco announced last week that this year it expects to outline that by surpassing billions of gross advertising revenues, it will become the first television channel, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that provides for the group's advertising.
If the predicted figure were actually achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, Antena 3 net sales increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of the television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors targeted by analysts for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay out that it has retained until now: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that while it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we've always reported much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of 33 % Endemolu'.
According to analysts, the market shows some fatigue at these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered their earnings estimates of Telecinco in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to explaining that the expected revenue growth from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antena 3, 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles primarily based on increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: evaluates Telecinco better (to accumulate) than Antenu 3 (to maintain) because of its 'numerous advantages' and trade growth.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not to overestimate them, as they face 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approves MiFID transposition valid from November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations, which were concluded today by a vote of Congress on amendments incorporated by the Senate in the bill, the government subjected a public hearing to a regulation that is developing a new law in order to make both come into force before the end of the year.
Party leaders have consistently highlighted the efforts of MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and to regulate the activities of the entities needed for the efficient functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Act on Securities Trading, foresees the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Commission for the Securities Market (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons to create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokerage agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of financial instruments operations is extended by linking multilateral trading systems and system of internalisation orders to competing with current stock exchange brokers to be linked to regulated secondary markets.
The law also obliges companies providing investment services to the market information about the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk-based methods and require keeping a statement of all transactions performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the discussion in the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which stands out that securitized receivables were considered a "complex" financial instrument given the high-security hazards for the investor, which was proven by what occurred in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legally demarcate functions that can be held by bachelors in the field of economic and business management 30 years after the Royal Decrench, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists, was approved in 1977.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union's inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data over time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimating information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be known on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the ISC’s November increase to 4.1% was “comparable,” but he predicted that the price index would continue to be relatively “high” in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clashed in the corridors of Congress that "even if it is not a favorable number," Spain's inflationary differential against the monetary union has become "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%,” the economy minister said.
Virgin plans to earn 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock came into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to £12 billion.
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined through two-and-a-half months by the client’s distrust despite the government offering a hundred percent guarantee for this money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity's name with its trademark Virgin Money, needs to earn around a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks over the next three years to earn the remaining £18 billion to reach a target of $30 billion.
The tycoon Richard Branson's group, known in the UK with its striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its resolutions.
This week, Northern Rock, named the offer of Virgin, which consists of three other companies, as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrests for alleged Corruptions in Construction
The civilian guard today in the early hours of the morning detained the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totan (from the People's Party) because of his alleged involvement in corruption practices in the construction that were unveiled this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretaries of the town hall and the head of the local police was arrested.
In May this year, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, a current MP from the People's Party and until then, the mayor of the municipality, who according to investigative sources approached by Cadena SER television, could have been the 'head' of the entire enterprise.
Police officers continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission and no further arrests are being ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect in the corruption practices in the construction, was charged, which was revealed earlier this week.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'Lidonian' MP Juan Morales, who was examined, was arrested when leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, the investigation is Morales’ alleged collection of commissions for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galician construction firm, which has reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepts bid to stand at the head of the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to preside over Congress
Former Defense Secretary José Bono accepted an offer from Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary-General José Luiso Rodríguez Zapater to head the PSOE (Spain Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election, and if the Socialists win a general election, he became the chairman of Congress.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE Secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place at noon today at the federal headquarters of the party.
The head of the executive branch justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the chairman of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, as President of Congress, who published his decision not to run in the next general election on November 15 and to abandon his active political career to pursue the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the top politics he left two years ago.
He further said that, like the citizens, they know who will be deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to "transparentally" announce who would preside over Congress.
If Bono gains this position, he hopes to transform the House into "house respect and not swearing or shouting" and will achieve that "it will increasingly resemble citizens."
“Occasionary occasion, unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where you can’t speak peacefully and peacefully is Congress has suspended the President of the Senate on one occasion 26 times.”
Likewise, he gave praise for the current president Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place, so as not to stooge to say what his opponents might consider "greedy."
Climate propaganda
Given that the anti-climate change movement undermining the merciless persecution of both those who see skeptically at its predictions, and those who prefer other political and social struggles, must show firm coherence.
Moreover, to have a leader of a movement who is prime minister as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal forces him to explain why his government’s action or inaction has made a significant contribution to Spain’s conduct in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-performance, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the rule of treaties, has not prevented it.
Moreover, this will make him explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take in order to slow down climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who will pay to save the planet.
But we didn't see such explanations, we won't even see.
Precisely because you need to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centimeter of the price of gasoline, the proposed PSOE (Spain's Labour Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapatero in terms of elections that he hurried to reject it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet so that nothing stands, pure propaganda, slogans devoid of any true meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by covenes with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, accuses, does not demand anything, but is an adornment of meetings and arouses tenderness.
If it limits itself to being just a virtual party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool ourselves with a fan.
Totana Police Mayor and Chief of Local Police Detained on Suspicion of Corruption Practices in Construction
As reported by investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totan, the "people's party" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in the hospitality, on suspicion of committing crimes in the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, in whose premises he now finds himself along with a number of police officers who also came to the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests were added to the six that occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land suitable for the development, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the previous parliamentary term, could have built 4 000 homes.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged in an abbreviated procedure in the court of first instance of the city of Totana.
The six first arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of the real estate agency, registered today in Totane and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, was charged.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigran (Platevendra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is carried out by the group for crimes under the construction of the Civil Guard's operational central unit, whose members, in addition to the arrest, have also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the arrests, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontever, Las Rozas (placedness of Madrid) and Totans.
Only one person was imprisoned in Tothana at the time, in the area of a very well-known owner of the company for poultry meat products, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with the construction of the largest residential complex of the Murci city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Tothana, which was requalified and its project was supposed to double the settlement of the village, which has 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the time at the beginning of the report of the PISA program on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers published on November 18, on the same day that coincidenced the criticism of Blackburn's book appeared there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated the public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the city of Jokela.
The murderer of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical position on Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague informs about the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet to the Criminal Code:
A. Withdrawal of one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you alien in the store of boards of less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1 000 euros in the store, the theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than the exchange of compacts.
Participating in the disturbance has a rate from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be the rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punished by others than providing pornographic material to minors (Section 186).

My treating physician is shoving one of his articles on strange research, titled "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings caused by the monthly pay of employees, depending on how much colleagues earn.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on the tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the group The depiction of the neurocognic drug of the Institute of Life&Brain in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague wrongly."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor Of The Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been meeritable for eight years from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague for eight years to pursue criminals from the Balkan war.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8 000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.

What insurance is appropriate for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. constitutes a significant expenditure, which depends on various factors, such as age, status, gender, the length of possession of a driving licence, the type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive an agreed insurance amount in a certain amount for taking charge of the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, status, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely there is to be a crash, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons over the age of 25 and women must pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies have concluded that those living in marriage tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of journeys and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
The increase in the frequency of rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when they set the price of insurance premiums.
Therefore, the driver must well study the situation in order to choose the insurance that best corresponds to his profile of the insured.
Here we will show the most important variables for choosing one or another type of insurance, which, in addition to complying with the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five encounter different disadvantages such as little driving experience and short possession of a driver's license when they want to arrange premiums at an affordable price.
Although the best for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount of premiums in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the participation of the client in the payment of an insured event.
"Part of the payment of the insured event provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the premium, which will be all the higher than that which would be the lower the deductible," explains Luis Noguera, Head of First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants of the operation so that the client insures himself against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce premiums in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
Malus, on the other hand, is an increase in the base rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” Noguera explains.
After crossing the limit of twenty-five years, drivers have it easier when they go to take out insurance, because the client’s risk index is reduced, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks at a discount.
“Young people usually cannot use the experience of the pre-acquired when there is a crash, nor in the management,” assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of the proceedings, when the “fear of a newcomer” has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount of premiums (which could be €300) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other business participants, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount,” notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to insure against all risks with a discount of premiums (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other business participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a strong reason for properly studying the possibilities of insurance that would suit us best in relation to our personal situation.
Celtic tries to score a point at AC Milan that means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the league's "Champions" as it would mean being first for the Italians and it would decide the placeout for the Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured a draw in Portugal in the fifth game, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to be sure that Shakht'or will not get ahead of him with six points, who will play with Benfoka, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play for the 13th time in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to compete for the victory, because the Italians will not want to tactify on home soil and Celtic knows that after the win he would be first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
Gordon Strachan's team could even be a loss to advance if Shakht'or doesn't win, but he can't rely on that, because with the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) but won in the first straight match (2:0) will advance.
And so the AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening to the Scots, who believe that they will make the second time in the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same match in the previous competition with Kaka in overtime (1:0) after 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hope to win the "rospowerers" will be Shakhtyor, for whom he is worth a victory, if only Celtic loses, both for advancing to the eight-finals and for staying at UEFA.
Benfica, although last and does not have the opportunity to continue the top European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20 000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls launched their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20 000 spectators since it broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they opened their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver declared that their group's reconnection was "great."
About 20 000 people bought out tickets so they could be present at a concert that also included a video that depicts the band's history that sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as a new album released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by the husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though a nervous Victoria banned him from doing so a few days ago.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that he "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to the contradictions between us" caused the dissolution of a five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness during a meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion had changed, the opinion on the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made my decision," Chisholm said of the reunion of the group she herself dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things have settled and we all love themselves very much."
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with a special Virgin Airlines.
On arrival, an army of nannies awaited them at the airport.
The five have a total of 7 children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns about a new gas quake between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute over natural gas prices between Russia and Ukraine, and thus the risk of Russian supply of this fuel to Western Europe is increasing.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is led by pipeline through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is being closely watched.
Kiev warned that if Moscow lifts gas prices for Ukraine, it would charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between these two last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its vans from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a crushing fall in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the supply to the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but a large part of them remains underused.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The inspector said the Scottish Chamber of the NHS must improve the checks of criminal records among non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an exact idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were in order for a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in staff from outside the European Economic Area immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge charged with links to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS chambers are expected to check foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK before his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission is using Disclosure Scotland for criminal charges, the agency has no power to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that commissions should be guided by Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which helps employers with controls in several countries.
"Even though we found that part of the personnel's records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS is in many ways consistent with its own policy of pre-employee clearances, but also added: "Our report highlights areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information on the amount of foreign personnel."
Chairman of the BMA Scotland dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit an act of terrorism in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employee controls at the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1 161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had a problem identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that the established procedures for checks at the NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampanier, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reworking the policy and directives of pre-employment controls for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to handle this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in line with health commissions, will consider recommending the report and ensuring that the best practices emerge in the updated directives of pre-employment checks on all personnel - including the foreign ones it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has garnered five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Film Award.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who, up to the role of Curtis, worked in a warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and the supporting role of Toby Kebell.

But he won two awards for the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic U2 album's iconic Joshua Tree album, for best directing and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another awardee - as Julien Templ's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for the best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen was flanked by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of the Russian mafia boss in London's thriller David Croenberg Eastern promises.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation on the roles of tough guys, won a Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
This fifty-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me," he added.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, the great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury attended by filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants over membership of cells preparing an imminent attack on oil facilities as well as on clergy and security forces.
State-owned oil exporter's state broadcaster said one of the cells wanted to inject missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35 000-member rapid response unit to defend the facility since the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Aqqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry's internal statement: 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missing missile launcher" that slipped into the country.
She said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were to prepare the murders of cleric and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to try harder to prevent the Saudis from leaving Iraq to join the al-Qaeda militants fighting with allied troops and the Shiite U.S.-backed U.S.-backed, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretic.
Al-Qaida militants believe authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - backed by the calls of al-Qaeda leader Saudi Usama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," a ministry's internal spokesman told state television.
Also arrested a 16-member "media cell" in Medina, which aimed to promote "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims designated as infaiths and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may once be a pleasant place to live.
Data from orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more similar to the dominoes of Earth's header than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit in similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus conditions were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the frightened greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rotation rate sent Venus along a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt the lead and it is ravaged by storms and winds of the power of the hurricane.
The findings from the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, offer a sober look at how Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “It is becoming clearer why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to compile a scenario in which Venus began, like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police detain 'enriched uranium'
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million.
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not worthy for the presidential candidates to answer questions from the snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions on video and handed them over to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot on the state of the Republican Party heading for next year's elections.
It is unclear exactly how CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single theme, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the most powerful Republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the reel when they heard something pleasing: the announcer noted the highlights of the consent when the candidates talked about hard access at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who pushed himself forward in key early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as the mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
These two struggled particularly fiercely when asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
The sidegoers, such as Duncan Hunter, the California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the Colorado congressman, managed to throw his little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance of nomination, but both remain in play perhaps because they started sounding the alarm for immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have roughly the same view: greater thud at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears of poisonous toys from China and other worries with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the conclusion that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another interviewer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now at the top of all preconditions in a recent Iowa polling for his long-term Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is annoying but necessary.
Under pressure, whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning a laugh.
The duell remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent success in raising money and Ron Paul's loud rejoicing at Wednesday's debate.
These two bounced off the bottom because both parties' wings still can't agree on better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the victorious news of American size on the lips, winks at both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from unambiguous.
Labour Pain
Gordon Brown again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is customary for British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
There don't seem to be sold any orders, no bills at the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers were sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have dispensed with the discovery that some wealthy businessman had masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of £6500,000 under the names of other people for four years, and that the party had not announced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling the election and insulting British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope of securing a resilient and effective government.
Instead of forming the increasingly witty acting chairman of the Liberal Democrats, the once feared Mr Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
A clumsy bailout of the troubled bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in the proceedings and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed an unimaginable administrative waking-up.
The trio of retired generals kicked off the rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against the cuts in military spending, claiming that being the commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many-cute gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary-general of Labour (and their former inner discipline guard), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably coming to an end.
Despite this, governments can reach the point of the flipping beyond which they find the hard rule.
People don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually push their disbelief when a new bunch takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and he doesn’t even have to be in office for long, this postponement is gone: the state administration is becoming leaky, ministers start doing briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, because he cannot take the position of a new broom against other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the tax office's records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as finance minister.
And even though he was not directly involved in the Blairov troubles, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "worths for money", voters can easily conclude that he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's troubles are not as bad as they seem.
The mistakes aren't as ghastly as the Conservatives make them.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was not deceited.
And the treatment, however painful it can be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The latest utterance around political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not wish any publicity for his philanthropy.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of great political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams' actions, but he didn't know it was illegal, he would certainly be thoroughly questioned; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money seeker who learned of the tricky gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not yet involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, even though the main part of the payments took place only after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but diluted his determination by reaching for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - moreover, led by the bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do, such as finding the permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has had no one for six months, and to advance with a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require Labour, who are in a tight spot to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a devoted party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to work out victory is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the U.S. credit card market affect the U.S. underpriviette?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins begin to flive arousatelously around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is withering, predators have focused on the local credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say losses on credit cards could reach $99 billion if other variants of consumer credit were to become infected from inferior mortgages.
Signs of tension are clear.
The number of cases of inability to repay (with more than 30-day payment delays) and written accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable) is increasing.
HSBC announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market - also because of insolvent credit card loans.
However, it is still early to panic.
Described bills and the inability to repay are still few.
According to Moody's valuation agency, 3.89% of the default rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Acts of 2005 led to a sharp drop in the number of reported bankruptcies that make a large portion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciation) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate showing how much consumers pay monthly from their debts.
And the confidence in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGrouup predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% greater than last year.
Direct routes to spread infection between the inferior mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when wealth loans in real estate are drying up, consumers are rather indebted through credit cards.
However, credit card publishers look at cash flow rather than the values of hand-to-hand items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They may even be beneficial for lenders.
Consumer motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards shifts upwards on the list of priorities to repayment.
Card issuers are also able to respond more rapidly and flexibly to more tumulne conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid change in the prices of liability subjects.
"We don't just reconsiders all the loans one beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, financial head of Capital One.
Although the risk of an inferior mortgage-style explosion is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt reductions are pushing America into recession, the credit card industry will be facing a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud associated with former Enron Group financial leadership Andrew Fastow changed their testimony on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially blamed in seven allegations of fraud, when he and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers -- denied.
They were supposed to stand trial in January.
However, during a trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone pleaded guilty to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front pages for two years that lasted the issuing procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the 2001 investigation, begun after the collapse of Enrona.
The accusations against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation over the collapse of Enron.
An indicted against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot the scam along with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Koper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner branch of Enron controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a lot of Enron's fraud that pushed Enron down the spiral towards the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch with zero, but our three Britons knew it was in fact worth a significant value.
Under Kopper's control, the company bought a bank's stake in this £1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250 000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misrepredicted Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the $20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two cases of conspiracy to collapse Enrona.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarakana.
All three Britons were on a $1 million bail that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming court.
Enron, once the country's seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billion-dollar debts or show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former lead lead executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their roles in the fall of the company last year.
Skilling is in the execution of more than twenty-four years of sentence.
Rumours over Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other allegations were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and a sufficient fuel volume for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, these are minors to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a narrow family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of ostentatious consumption at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping that freshly wealthy Russians would lure everything from mahogany-inlanted yachts to diamond-adorned carbopt partitions, which would not be ashamed of even 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but against us it's dime and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
On the waves of oil, money is pouring into the Russian capital as much as when Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 80's when some Americans got tremendously rich and traveled to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center of Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudis, the 70's and the Japanese in the 90's, the Russians become the most prominent world spending.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference of the luxury industry Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, attracted the LVMH Group's luxury industry conference to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires of 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main institute in the Center for Economics and Financial Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "secondary" millionaires in Russia, whose assets total the $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of London's jewellery store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed, and men are all worthy."
When they walked in the evening dresses on Sunday evening halls, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five years older Svetlana Turovtsova described themselves and her clients as millionaires.
"I was looking at those cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who rolled into designer clothes like a red carpet veteran next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a house stick.
The fair seemed aimed primarily at fresh rich people, branded Russian buyers who are willing to sit in the road for several hours so that they can walk around the warehouse, which gaudy-sweet Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom glider tables, apartments in Dubai, Gund stuffed animals and drafts.
Members of the simple public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's painting from hand-painted blue tiles in a larger-than-life size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in tinsel."
And indeed, the local salesmen say that the Russians with the old money (according to Russian standards is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the glittering logos to the little-known brands limited by the editions, which would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires' envoys or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them shopped.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's beds, said he had sold two mattress sets made of silk, cashmead and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, of $70 000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, who equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170 000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, the president of L.A. The connection, which optionally modifies luxury cars, that he sold three bars for cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms of $55 000.
He showed the reporter the wheel of the car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a string coated with Swarovsky crystals so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22 000 for four such.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostriple leather bikes or a portrait of his cubic zirconia doesn't have to ride those wheels yet," Carapteian said.
"He'll store them in his garage of thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing much exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of the local real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a booth operated by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company raised four red British-style phone booths stuffed with a million-dollar column of fake banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500 000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires' Fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to get a picture of their friends by mobile phone, resting in the middle of a spare wealth, or simply stuffing a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a rotting operation
It was the day before the Thanksgiving feast when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant A little healthier and watched an ambulance that had come to a white New English house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon the car of the police patrol was joined.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's van arrive," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant inspector.
"At that moment I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, assistant to the director of the Newar Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police refused to provide, who worked at house 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of mourning by the New Iraqi police.
Miss Arroy was an assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newar police officer who works for the Commission for the Control of Alcoholic Beverages, and that he leaves behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the District's Union District, Theodora J. Romankowa, she said detectives were trying to determine if Miss Arroy died of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they reached the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon 21.
November and found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities interviewed Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a surge card.
On Wednesday in the house of Miss Castro, with a damaged pink bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillan" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics, was in the open garage.
Two mountain bikes hung on the hooks on one side.
Mr McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroy gave him invaluable help in chewing through the intolerable and rugged political culture of his new city.
"You said, 'You should be careful of this or this one,'" he said.
"She's always been here when I came, and she's always been here when I left.
It was embarrassing.”
Hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates lead to strengthening world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hopes of the Federal Bank attempting to calm lending terms by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by reassuring statements by the vice-president of the US central bank.
The stock exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernank, the Fed chairman, said that in responding to continued pressure on financial markets, the leaders must be "flexible and pragmatic."
As part of an obvious effort to calm the irritable markets amid signs of resusciating credit exertion, Mr Kohn said that recent excitements "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets towards the end of September and October."
He also said that if increased instability persists, the possibility of household and business financial conditions will further deteriorate.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital benefits to U.S. markets, and possibly further lower interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy when apartment sales in October showed record low numbers.
The consequences of financial swilence were underlined by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, which is 4% of its world's labor, in terms of cost-cutting down due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by a failed bet on the provision of inferior loans for housing in America.
Only 20 of these sites are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, with Britain's blue-chip value rising by more than £39 billion.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent, with France's CAC40 rising 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, the credit tensions on the markets showed full force after these funds were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7% in the auction of the three-month cash packages of the European Central Bank, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and launch premium money into London's money markets has increased, with the rates of the three-month UK interbank loans "Libor" rising after uninterrupted growth from November 12 to their high from the end of September - 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who is at best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision-making, and the table of Hugh Morris, the England team's chief executive, is starting to fill with apps for the post of national selector, even if not necessarily full-time.
He who will not be placed in the sixth place on the bat will be unfortunate, but life is often not fair and sport is certainly not at all.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over a lower level, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than abilities.
Not only in cricket, the choice is challenging and requires an opinion that ultimately always has to be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if so?
We might ask the same questions in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and field review, should be promoted to the commission - the place is for just one.
Who's supposed to say which level is right for a ricker when you can't give a chance to drop or saith on the next one?
Naturally, the numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but so do the opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain's perspective at the right moment, whether to take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances in novice positions, if he should ever make an impression as a one-day cricket.
Capturing the selectionist's view is more complicated.
Last season, for example, there were many better, James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs to each.
Chris Tremlet took only 29 at the same modest average, but both had their times at the highest level and hope for the next one.
Whether he will play at Asgiiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
A choice can start or run the career of both, or it may not have much effect.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and gave good performances in the first class, five wickets and 40 vacations, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time struggled for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Critical, who is extra, although he scored twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia, perhaps still underrated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion following today's training at the Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience over Bopar's youthful lunatic.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class, compared to six Bopar's, who, at the age of twenty-two, is seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah made only ten runs in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in Test on Lord's, his hometown of Middlesex, his Middlesex court, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the collectors, when Vaughan wanted to cast him again for the next game, his launch seems to have taken off some of the vigor that was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex universal has a fairy de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scare him on the cricket pitch, and his behavior outside the pitch symbolizes his recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He escaped with a slight injury and probably a shock, but the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "See that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, her medium-fast sheds on the local playgrounds that seem to suit him, she distributes effectively and firing confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that’s the real art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to get Bopara his chance now, but I don’t want to say that Shah won’t excel if, as Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it will be him who will play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and emptying refugees who ran out of money or expired visas, and others hoping the city was returning to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who expelled them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived in an official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors killed in Baghdad," Sabah al-Kubasi, a Sunni doctor, said in a statement.
"Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the papers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militist for militant cleric Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to break the fight.
Qasim al-Atwani, a thirty-eight-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amarija, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariy called him, saying that the local militia with the support of the U.S. military helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven out of his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"A few friends called me the day before yesterday and they told me that she was launching a militia against al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said sixty-two-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the attraction of calming in the capital after strengthening the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of intrigue citizens" that, with a gun in hand alongside the U.S. military, defending their neighborhood.
But more talked about the fact that they were forced to return by obstruction around visas and money loss in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the fifty-one-year-old father of three, has voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, has asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and prompt them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Partial reason for attenuation of violence is the fact that the Sunnis were pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will again stir up sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state of Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even the international focus of its universities.
In just one educational area, Saarland is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Saarland yesterday I explained for the 50th time that we are not French" - this self-ironic motto appears in Saarsko on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a big role in the Saar education system, which is in fifth place in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally been closely cooperating with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can end their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Sarinary children are admitted to university - many of them even without studying at grammar school.
"In Saarland, a professional education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at IW.
By obtaining more than one in five juveniles entitled to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The possibility of studying two fields is the second best in Germany with regard to the population.
Despite virtually oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saar Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other Länder also take over.
If the results of pupils improve significantly, only future comparative studies will show.
In the 2003 Pisa study, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved by as much as other Länder.
Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of the Saar Pisa studies do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Saarland could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory in grammar schools - although the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chavez shifts hours
What not to see will go for hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will move the clock in this South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chavez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that the hours will shift by minus four and a half hours, according to the new law, compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, that the United States imposed the distribution of time zones to the world throughout the hours.
In addition, on Wednesday local time, Chavez announced that he would suspend relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage case.
This left-wing nationalist has said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he would not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't because of my self-esteem," said Chavez, who is pushing for a reform of the constitution that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument was sparked by Uribe's decision to take away Chávez's mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
With his decision to Venezuela, Uribe spit in the face, criticized Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile ringtone caused a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet anymore?) - that's a phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was expressed by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the recent Ibero-American summit loud remarks of this left-wing populist so angry populist that he silenced him in this way.
Germans face lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of a reduction in real wages this year despite a strong boom.
Experts justified their pessimistic prognosis with a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically count on getting lower wages than last year.
"The fault lies with a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjukturforschung) told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also be awaiting unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the new year's planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not fall into such difficulties again that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Saviour, the newspaper quoted the social democratic politician as saying.
On Tuesday, it was released that a price explosion of food and petroleum products had driven inflation to its highest level in thirteen years.
In the annual comparison, the prices increased by three percent overall.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth
Despite its life-friendly atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than previously thought. The European spacecraft Venus Express on Venus has seen phenomena that also appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and windy vortices at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is gleaming.
Now the European spacecraft Venus Express has yielded evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. There are lightning fasting in Venus from cloud to a cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the well-known theory of the formation of primordial matter, life could have arisen on Earth thanks to lightning. Storms have reportedly provoked reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
In Venus, this was not the case: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there would be barely a living thing on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but he's a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, who is so similar to the Earth, began to develop in a completely different way, is the basic issue of the Ace mission.
Since the early 1990s, no probe has been sent solely for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express spacecraft in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which were introduced by several articles by the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known winds at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloudy vortex at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmic.
The second most insidious planet in our solar system is almost the same matter as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as Morningstar or Evening Star, orbits the Sun in nearly 225 days.
Around its own axis, however, it turns much slower. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bars (short for bar?) It does not resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both of them. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans, while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, Venus makes up the majority of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to party disputes over the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the chancellor after a meeting between them in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany’s reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the strife around the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not outwardly present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Thith I respect the cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
The Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not prevent him from defending Merkel when she was reproached with her for creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional politics of a unified China.
China knows it too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the "predictive" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed the position of China.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions, which are also located on the territory of China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that broke out in France
Street fights with the police, gunfights, ignited cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrest that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior urges.
The barraques were burning, rioters were shooting with shotguns at the police. After the serious unrest of juveniles in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful that we do not create such social tensions that break out in violence.
We have to take it seriously," Neue Presse said in Hanover's newspaper.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with a quick change in social reality.
The Federal Government, the countries and municipalities are already working hard to fix the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit on Integration to the Conference on Islam, we have seen our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In recent years, juveniles have waged tough street fighting with police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above-average high."
First of all, it is necessary to provide a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat emphasized: "We must give the youthful hope."
However, the chairman of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kola said, "Yet we have to be careful."
We must "quickly allow teenagers to start working and educate themselves."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely calm.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several lit rubbish bins and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1 000 delegated forces have taken care of peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
In the riots in the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's riots engulfed.
The mess was caused by Sunday's car accident, in which two juveniles lost their lives.
According to initial findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not to blame for the death of juveniles.
In the realm of Angela "The Clouds"
The Chancellor’s reality documents the distant output that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can expect nothing more from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her bleed, indifferent and indifferent-poor appearance at the general debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which, after all, it should manage.
To the fact that he concentrates too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once responded in a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserves the remorse.
There was no real interest from Merkel, let alone a sense of problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who stands out above the others who flee to foreign policy and even there express herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it is praised without ceasing for the conclusions drawn from the Heiligendamm summit, but it no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such self-praise - so much immodesty would have been forgiven by the CDU two years ago.
It is now limited to idle phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, it damages its immiscite with pragmats, who do not need to flatter, because they solve problems.
But in the realm of Angela "The Clouds" are internal political problems a fringe.
Childhood poverty and the worries of people with low wages?
A few subordinate sentences on these topics are left.
It is worth noting how often Merkel, when it comes to child benefits, is said.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to pronounce at least partially the correct sentence.
As soon as things become too concrete, he stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department Of Attacks
The debate of Republican presidential candidates on Youtube has sparked a heated debate in the case of the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney in a heated debate - and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tensions of both candidates are reflected in the first topic.
Mitt Romney bids his opponent Rudy Guiliani for making New York City a "foreign refuge for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp remorse: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, throwing to former Massachusetts governor for privately employing immigrants without papers.
The candidates are on the attack. As the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these CNN debates mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minutes, Internet users shot and via Youtube sent videos serve only as such clues to a key topic.
“We have allowed Hitler to seize power by exactly such a policy of isolation,” said John McCain to his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one to push for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain spares no remorse or Romney for denying condemning the torturing method of interrogation called "Waterboarding" in which the heating is simulated.
Audience reactions in Florida's St. Petersburg shows that the important themes of the campaign are neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture.
The audience breaks into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains contritely, asking the party base and television audience for forgiveness for the fact that he was still in favour of carrying out abortions in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in plainclothes for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf passed the presidential oath.
This ends eight years in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharaf, took the oath of presidential leave on Thursday, leaving the presidency for the next five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live a ceremony held in the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the Constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to the commander-in-chief of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby undermining international pressure, especially from the U.S.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
Withdrawal from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces fulfilled Musharaf one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
According to Chief Public Prosecutor Malik Mohammed Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency soon after its oath, fulfilling another of the Western demands.
The Supreme Court of the country, which occupied Musharraf after the declaration of a state of emergency at the beginning of November, rejected all objections about the disputed re-election of the head of state in the past week. October.
Meanwhile, in the attack on the military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
An army spokesman said the bomb had exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
Fathers of krutrorock return
The famous German group of the 1970s plays again. Three members of the Harmonia group took up their electronic synthyizers again at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already known abroad.
The announced sensation lies in the performance of the three sedentary gentlemen, who initially look like they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius is sitting in the middle in the middle of the snow-white shirt.
On his left is the fifty-seven-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is intently leaning over the synthesizers, is on the right from the perspective of the spectators.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, of course, inadvertently, a traditional composition will be created.
It seems that the musicians don't care too much.
Among the lovers of krautrock, the band Harmonia's revival caused a considerable stir.
One thing here is worth noticing. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not so established that someone would miss this band for twenty-three years painfully.
But why can't even a German celebrate his ever-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when he values the musical style, mistakenly called kravrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
When the music business awarded the Echo Award for the life-of-life work to the surviving members of the Can group, the hall was full of questioning views of German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! during their speech, the astonishment of the audience no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloaded memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time it was far from the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius have previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar of the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramophone company led by the church.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but he gained his reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother was followed by Cluster musicians to an exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Stary Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, they lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
It was more like a life in such a spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the garb.
Harmonius kept a lot of it.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so peaceful and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting the grates was not only self-knowledge.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been edited in front of a record-breakingly small, barely 50-man backdrop.
At the time, Rothera expressed his wish that the members of Harmony should be excited and occasionally exercised.
It was a very rude requirement for Roedlia and Moebi.
In 1975, the band announced its break-up.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
The band Cluster came to life again in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording firm Grönland has taken the goal of cherishing kratucky as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered to be Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The Physical Resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The present will be a Briton, Julian Cope, an old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This outlined the overall breadth of the impact of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian En's theorem, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "Unique true music, it belongs to the future."
There are paintings on which the producer and Harmony are in the peasant seat.
The projection of other black-and-white photographs, on which the set of devices is wildly connected by cables, also contributes to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are again busy with improvisation.
No longer by gluing the microphones to the organ and drums to extract the never-before-hot self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technique of immersed meticulous meticulous.
This is not changed by the choir of the House of World Cultures.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she is emphthically sung "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never rock.
Rather than in blues, we would find roots at music colleges (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the run from art and social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not let herself be brought out of peace.
Even the most obvious thing is thought out on the scene.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question will either deprive a person of his nerves or indulge him to experience ephemeral moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With the films The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans have appeared.
But neither of them is convincing.
The model of the films either places too much emphasis on the actions and shooting, or they are too touching.
This is not prevented by the actor like Richard Gere.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he has starred in many attractive, unserious roles in relaxed women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences eternally on the theme of Buddhism, they take away a man's appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become prey (Why does the titles of films have to be so long and tangled today?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could have become if fate and film industry weren’t so merciful: a man who has had his best years for a long time, but as a wreckage like a memorial still retains a certain remarkable charm.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mördersister Frieden, which is also entering cinemas this week, is just a sequel to an endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mördersister Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescues a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television-shouldered film turns into shooting and action too soon.
From the film will remain something very similar to the series Cobra 11, although without the highway, but for that with the war.
The Hunting Party can be illustrated why it has not yet been possible to make a really good film about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who set out for a "fox," a Serbian chief war criminal, could perhaps become a new "Apocalypse" in another time, and under the leadership of another director and screenwriter (here is both Richard Shepard).
For the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes the way to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauchery and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the original will prescribe him a romantic affair with the later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be finally written off after reporters in the last five expedited minutes of the film do what NATO, the CIA and all the criminal hunters of the world have failed to catch criminals in the last five years: catching criminals and leaving it with the just revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so opposed to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a deeply human message.
He condemns the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not engage in persecution quite intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women are attacked by the famous Brecht's poem.
In it, it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "With compassion, I look at the sagging veins on my forehead, noteworthy: how strenuous it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, they show exactly such swollen heads, but they suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of war in the Balkans.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were great failures.
One thing can be added: There has never been a good film about South Africa.
It's almost always true: When a star wanders around the crisis area or walks in a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Breakdown Borders with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
After all, they had to run decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie - the Schindler List.
Many film must probably mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Horseman of the deer", "Apocalypse" or "Leave Vest" - were not celebrated at that time as masterpieces.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The screenwriters then don't have the ability that's needed to unfathomablely tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcastically distant artistic view like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the "Balkan War," he declared: "The form lies only in the fact that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for renouncing the Olympics
The mayor's resignation from hosting the Hamburg Summer Olympics has come across sharp criticism from politics and economy.
Many want to continue to fight to organize games by the water.
But Von Beust urges realism in estimating chances.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called this decision "unfortunate in terms of business".
No other project has recently awakened such great motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, this sportingly political enthusiasm could not be maintained to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed schedule."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained with his earlier testimonies on Wednesday, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Association will decide on Munich's run for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference for us means that with a timeline of 2028, we don't have any realistic chances."
Yet this dream is not yet over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust’s remarks regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to bid for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is still too soon to ruin the chances of calling the plans buried at this early stage," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
A resussing would be inconsistent with the testimony of the head of the senate, which he uttered at the general meeting of the General German Higher University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce the candidacy of Hamburg for the University in 2015 as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association Hamburg has only recently nominated for a candidate town.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg parliament of the Senate has reproached for wasting valuable time that could be used for the construction of apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because he bet on hosting the Olympics and expelling the construction of the apartments," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region was still planning the Olympics, saying the entire area would later be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor."
Applying for the 2012 Summer Olympics has made great excitement in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes
Whoever combines the terms Sweden and the wooden crates does not think about Andy Warhol, but on Ikea.
Or yes?
Wooden crates produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his on the list of ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museetus Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought dismisorship; six "Brillo boxes" that was donated by the Moderna Museetus museum in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultun, are copies - as are the most of the other "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of art and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painting wooden crates based on the red-and-blue design of the Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
In 1968, the exhibition of his works at Moderna Museet performed hundreds of Brillo boxes made a cardboard – with Warhol’s approval. These did not come (from financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
They were not works of art, but about their originals, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brills in Sweden, but they are not on display at Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time are now talking about fifteen crates that rightly entered artistic and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brills" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100 000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968, approximately one hundred crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten crates were made in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By that time, Warhol was dead three years after his death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, explored in addition to the six Brill boxes that are owned by the museum, also three Brill boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood boards were painted with basic paint and sanded, they were painted with an oil white paint with a brush.
On the contrary, it became clear from the structure of copies from 1990 that the paint was applied with a painting roll directly on the plywood board without prior prime of the coating - in addition, it is an acrylic and not an oily color.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official list of Brillo boxes," said Moderna Museet's director Lars Nrittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn't come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exclusive material - copies.""
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "proper allegations" that had been made in the case of soap powder boxes.
But the organization is still in relentful silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who fortified themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers committed by the government had previously attacked a hotel with the deployment of tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had been fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the hearing to flee with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president convened an urgent session of the security cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003, the Manila financial region became the main scene of the rebellion of about 200 troops against Arroy.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellative failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have tried at least seven times in the Philippines to overthrow the democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than twenty percent of its share in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 200.05% of the share capital.
There was previously speculation about a takeover.
The company still counts on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that this step is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator's firm by an additional 5% to 15.1%, entry conjectures emerged on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this financial institution holds shares only for the third party.
Yesterday, United Internet at Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications provider, had almost a 10% stake.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch gave an additional 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros to sell.
Of these, 5.15 million bought the shares for 31.4 million euros United Internet.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson explained.
In order to take over a rival Freenet, the companies together established a joint venture of SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that the two companies will be satisfied with a share of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and would not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of this business.
It is considered that companies keep all options open, especially the possibility of further increasing their share in Freenet AG.
Interviews between United Internet and Freenet regarding the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This month-long and difficult-to-seen game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile network contractors at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections.
Holding United Internet and Drillische held a 6.01% stake in Freenet so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will get approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
