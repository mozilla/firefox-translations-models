Prague Stock Exchange Crested to Minus at the end of trading
After the morning slump, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
Right from the beginning of Tuesday's trading, the Prague Stock Exchange has continued its slump since the start of Tuesday's trading, falling by almost six percent.
This time, the decline is a slumping for stocks on Wall Street.
In our country, too, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the local financial sector.
The Fall of Stocks in Asia
Stocks on the Asia stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index has written off nearly four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Stock exchange stocks lost more than five percent, but eventually cut losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock exchange fell 3.6 percent, according to the index.
"The timing of the rescue operation in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary policy firm.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy on its own, without dependence on China's central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should urgently return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will feel the effects.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system for which up to $700 billion was to be spent.
Lawmakers have ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indexes saw the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, and the slump in a similar magnitude last saw in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the bill had not passed in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress backs down: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
Top U.S. Congressional Leaders and the Government of President George W. Bush has agreed on a broader form of a deal on financial aid for the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approving a bailout plan in the form of financial aid for the U.S. financial system of $700 billion.
However, it has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to the sources, the plan could probably be voted on on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, then there will be "sobering up" due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help markets achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a lot of progress.
We have resolved our differing views on what the form of the market stabilization package should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the final form to the government fund.
It should buy unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies that are withdrawing financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement of a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to make a final deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where Congressional decisions could affect Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear when both chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they can’t get stuck on a last-minute deal.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended for the assistance of the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is due to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in order of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush praised progress in negotiations
The president may veto this decision, but Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has plummety, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages have been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said in a statement.
U.S. President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciates “bo-partisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies.”
Restrictions on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said the legislators agreed on responsibility for the monetary program, protecting taxpayers from losses, taking hold of concessions, timing of the plan's financing.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of company participating in the program and setting up a committee to supervise the fund.
It should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard on this and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said in a statement.
The plan also provides for help for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments for mortgages they will buy in order to reduce the monthly payload costs for borrowers and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patrio Finance, David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses of the financial sector and the government will divide the losses among themselves," Marek told news server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now, or early next week, according to Marek, is not so important.
“It is much more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that it will be possible to sanctify it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the fact that there will be approval is the most important thing at the moment," Marek stressed.
Right-wing populists' triumph in Austria, combined with 29 per cent
The significant weakening of both parties of the existing grand coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties brought Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP lost even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these big parties in Austrian post-war history and, especially among the People's Party, who have triggered early elections, a literally disastrous outcome.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP came out of the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead in the preferences over the SPÖ.
Voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an emergency meeting of the party bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the increasingly likely starting point from the election result, i.e. to the renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, due to the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free (FPÖ) won tentatively 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the vote - at the same time, the Social Democrats expressed concern about the repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time it was still united, in 2005 it split off from the BZÖ) on a joint government that even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on this development, who has already said he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna to national politics.
The Green Party also came to parliament, but it lost slightly and fell among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties, apparently, surpassed the four percent threshold and did not make it to parliament.
Knee clash: MP3 anti-mobile player.
We will advise on how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for a person to buy a separate player.
The choice completely depends on the method of use and the demands of the future owner.
You can hardly get a high-end expensive gramophone home to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulence.
On the one hand, such music products on LP boards do not come out, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues are crested on your shelves, you are probably at least dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true with music on the go, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on the player, just like a Pink Floyd fan it will probably be hard to bite the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Decides battery life
Some high-end music players can do much more than just playing music, but what most mobiles can no chance.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, record both, he has a better, worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures of anything.
The versatility of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for more than ten twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobile phones, therefore, you will not be playing for you for more than a few hours.
If you call each other and there, get one more charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not every one of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but few card reader can cope with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without reduction.
With exceptions, you do not need any special software for players (iPod).
Just fill the device with USB music from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players already create a music library sorted by the name of the artist, the name of the album, genre or user evaluation.
Some devices only show the tree structure of directories similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a particular device, be especially interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If the music is primarily a scene and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you need any mobile phone that will play MP3.
Which can really do almost any phone.
You don’t even have to watch the music formats your mobile phone or player can do.
MP3 can handle all of them, and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and, in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Less is AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit the relevant website of the operator (or another provider) over the mobile Internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a compelling argument for the acquisition of a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is usually limited to quick-fer fermented radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is believed that this way of selling music (when through GSM, internet or wireless internet) dominates the music industry in the future.
Most people carry a cell phone with them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you feel your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired hands-free with you.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
However, you will usually be limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm socket for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can control really anyone.
The minimum functions, the similarity of control with a previously common tape recorder or a turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of a mistakenly turned on mobile internet and then a giant account for data transmission.
What device to reach for
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can cope with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iris.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you prefer to reach for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
The furthest is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman mobile phones have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), they will take MP3 players from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
Maybe he won't miss him for long.
We have written many times about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
After all, this was confirmed by CTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS in our country is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the latest steps by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to go into battle.
It may sound paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrations high above 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to pretend that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ), often acknowledges them, and has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network probably does not have much chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It is the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, which were then also affected by classical operators.
Even before the entry of pikes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK as in the UK.
However, it turns out that there is room for such operators and can be really successful.
After all, we don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona, among others, in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them the relatively high cost of the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, the bet on the novel target group can also be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"The right guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could catch in our country.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, on the contrary, they try to do everything they can to prevent any potential competitor.
The GTS Novera Group has not hidden the interest in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to move forward with some of them in negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group's press spokesman.
Maybe it's flashing for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be expected by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónika O2 press department told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2: "So far, we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to continue to build."
He adds: "A virtual operator will hardly appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would already have to have a specific agreement on the table in order to consider in this short term."
Vodafone is focusing its attention rather on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to meeting potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial in terms of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when operators care about something, they can pull together, is also evidenced by the tussle around the creation of U:fon.
Perhaps the greatest pressure towards CTU went at the time of the creation of U:fon from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
But now U:fon is a reason to be an argument why not to admit a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was recently further enhanced by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially for his services."
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, it is directly striking the complete disinterest of Czech regulators.
It is not just the position of CTU, which unfortunately does not have the power to interfere in the Czech Republic - unlike the Great Britain and other developed countries - it does not have the power to interfere in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
However, he took his typical attitude to the whole issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the lease of the necessary infrastructure was concluded.
No such contract has been concluded yet, because the offer of potential candidates was probably not sufficiently interesting for conventional operators," Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the Office said in response to our question.
The statement thus formulated in this way will not surprise the representatives of the operators.
From the office, which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market, is more than considered.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "At foreign countries, where virtual operators normally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lowering prices for mobile phone services."
However, the pressure for the correct functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not among the interests of the Office.
In fact, the only thing that is shocking about the whole case is the touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is offered on its own.
Like the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is certainly only the work of chance and a hard competition.
"The Office has not found signs of anti-competitive conduct on this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so they have adequate increased responsibility for their market dealings.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are probably lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
Interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by CTU, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator is always required to be the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - has quite logically - on its network monopoly.
So in a certain segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
However, even if we do not concede this argument, it should be at least a warning to the Office that three mobile operators are doing the same thing.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The strengthening of responsibility on CTU is then a relatively common trick in telecommunications, by which the Office keeps its hands off the matter.
We have already met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of CTU to the area of competition in telecommunications could not be enforced, although many experts expected to improve the situation.
This must be known more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's possible when no one's looking
At the same time, the functioning of pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remain unnoticed.
These are companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, but only partially public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Its own mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies usually get to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a distinguished customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar resale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a violation of the terms and conditions that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová said.
However, it is unlikely that such activities would be brought to the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators opposes such a procedure.
They have significant profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it fully as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
This should be at least strange to CTU.
In addition, another question is being raised for the Office.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why do they block the formation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the Office has relatively strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the explanation of operators that they have no idea about such a thing and their terms and conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been made in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant drop in prices for services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at these times that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but by their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved that the first virtual operator was created and another one was packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are tossing the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than useful.
But let's not throw flint into the rye.
If behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will show up in our country very soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If any of the operators admit the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will hardly be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (discriminating) of other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech Statehood Day ceremonially presented new recordings of the national anthem Where My Home.
The national theatre orchestra was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral performance and instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over.
The authors of the anthem’s modifications are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymens.
He has previously told Czech Radio that he deliberately selected singers with young representative voices for singing solo variants, which are distinctive and popular.
"I have been trying to make sure that the choirs from the beginning and then I also tried to make sure that they have a clear diction, so that the text would be well understood, to resonate," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first heard in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidláček Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took her as their own.
The first stanchion of the song then after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "new" anthem
Prague Public Transport will also take a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1. October 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Public Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, it can get about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their chip card recorded in the information centers and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers used the service until the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in metro stations, where they have so far had to regularly stand on long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the Internet and upload it to them on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these places, a trained service counter is available to passengers, which will help those interested with an online purchase and also upload a purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service automata, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
Coupon inspects the driver's position automaton
The operation of the vending machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Just plug the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are mainly visited by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On the trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers, using which they determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained the inspection of tickets Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which compiles the timetables of Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built in the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but it is also necessary to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cashier.
This will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not run suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires, can go again to self-service vending machines, where coupons are recorded on the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will be displayed on the device display.
Sudetenland for referendum from the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the inclusion of the Šumava Mountains in the United States.
This is based on a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is the result of a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Research Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Šumava county" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have properly understood the situation and we want to be really sure that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads the letter, signed by the words "People who are concerned by the fate of Šumava."
Since joining Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - give hope only for brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the American president's letter to take over Šumava to take over the Protectorate for present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, this territory to any state to us to a foreigner who oppresses and refutes minorities and nothing, has contributed nothing to the Allied victory," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of vengeance of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubts the thinking of the Šumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Šumava county about whether its inhabitants want to become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it suitably illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Czech Germans had at least to suspect that it would be their expulsion from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy to the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
During the war, he was a German in Budweiser appointed to the navy at the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed him in a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans went to see him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when he got home, the Czech language would come in handy," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war in Czechoslovakia had expected to be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček’s office promises to discourage the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to be handcuffed before they leave.
He wants to reach into his conscience especially for young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the espezetka.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you pay."
This is to symbolize that a person can pay with his own life in a moment of inattention.
Spectators will be "scare" spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see pictures with drastic images of accident victims.
He promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG news agency.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver's system of sugar and whip is affected.
The sugar for them is that when they go red, for example, they save time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital.
And that is why information campaigns are needed in the press and especially negative advertising, psychologist says.
According to him, the boards are already less effective, warning the driver of the danger.
"If a static board is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and drivers will not devote themselves to it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, has spoken out in favour of the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, as well as Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the Jediot Achronot newspaper on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all at all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to advance a similar percentage to the Palestinians (a territory of Israel) because without that, there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that East Jerusalem would also include a possible return.
"Whoever wants safety in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to run his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic places" that lie inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
That won't work," he stressed further.
Leaving from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which he said is an inseparable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know what they're going to have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (shiite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support provided by the terrorism (shiite movement) of Hamas, (terrorist networks) of Al-Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq," he said.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India can cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been indicted in India for illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said Czech-Indian relations would be a certain cooling.
The minister stated this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
"If it had not been resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that the executive could hardly interfere in the judicial matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was accuseen of the indictment and punished with a fine, the central government may negotiate with the local government in Dardivigation, to whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for release on bail and await the verdict at liberty, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed his meeting.
"The recommendation is an appeal to the higher court, then it would be possible to pardon it," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can enter the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already providing them with such assistance.
“We are in the highest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India that have a long tradition.
The Indians also acknowledge this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech News Agency, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and imprison these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he received a promise of the matter to deal with the Indian side.
"I've had quite a few promises," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, you are not allowed to walk in a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers could move on the bus while driving.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is in violation of the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, in which the twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the time, in the least safe place in the car, although she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with places to stop according to the technical certificate.
If it is not homologated on the bus, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency remote buses do not have places for parking; which Aktuálně.cz was also confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jančura.
"This is what we and the ministry and at first the passenger did not allow the movement of passengers.
They then called it off and we came to the fact that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while they have their seat," he said.
The Law of the Steward Doesn't Know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legislation solves this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the date of the vehicle conductor; it does not define its rights and obligations," Hanzelka, a spokeswoman, adds less unequivocally.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law treats the law sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has the place to stand in the homologation.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban spaces, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places with higher permitted speed and remotely without standing places with the highest speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, expert says
BESIP expert on traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There is not much danger when driving smoothly, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
Nor here is certain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant can hit her head.”
"But if the bus brakes sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by the carriers internal regulations," he says, and he also says, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the services
Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus carrier.
It employs two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I will abolish them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers at boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars, the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we're against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There has been an immense tragedy
A young steward from the Pilsen region was killed in the accident of a regular service to Naples for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably deviated without using a signpost from the parking lane and blocked the bus path.
His driver tried to avoid a violent maneuver, but hit the right front.
Jančura refuses to sell out two places reserved for the rest of the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Modification of the law?
In sight
A clarification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could be brought by an amendment to the law, which the thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"She did not come to any particular conclusion.
Buses don't even solve much, rather a point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of a mobile phone while driving," says the expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concluded, adding that the control of bus safety is under the responsibility of the police and occupational safety authorities.
Czech Suspends the fight for the seabed
It will approach the wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine regions.
But he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of UN Divisions for Ocean and Law Affairs.
His boss, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, watches the interpretation and occasionally completes.
There is a work vigor and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
You can find oil, ores and other minerals, but also hitherit unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a cure for cancer.
The bottom larger than the mainland
Coastal states have started to run for new subways vehemently today.
Under the UN Convention, they use their rights, which were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often dates back to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it is exclusive to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply speaking, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its bedrock, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It reaches beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the bounds of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the demarcation of the external borders of the continental shelf shall be supported by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide legal and professional technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only three of the countries mentioned above have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success has recently been the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea possessions.
But it also acquired New Zealand - the area of the seabed, which the commission granted to it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will flow from the use of the seabed in the future will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other countries will also submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Action from Montego Bay."
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor begins, declared a "common heritage of mankind."
No longer has an exclusive state.
The law of mining in this area is granted by the convention established by an international institution.
"But the seabed is not a Klondajk," says director Mikulka in exaggeration, adding that his "individual areas are legally defined and their regime is contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern Blod within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it acquired the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" according to the convention, as well as investors of a few other states.
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The investor-explored area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"You can mine there on an area with a total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one such concession to the demonstration.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, a mythical shem that, according to legend, revived Golem.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The big words in the WestLB board of directors do not lack the bank's employees.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf money institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create a "central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trade on capital markets," we read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a long-term revenueset "set of competencies" into this transaction.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further associations in the sector of provincial banks.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the provincial government in North Rhine-Westphalia, that it is time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which savings customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, of whatever its kind, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
At the presentation of the six-month financial results at the end of August, Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas said that he does not make sense in the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, bank.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is behind one half of the provincial bank and the other, has instructed the board of directors to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about trades on the capital market or part of them.
But the talks have only just begun, the financiers are afflicted.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not discussed for the first time in the consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked like Deka-Bank's merger with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba's bank could occur for a while.
In the end, there was nothing from this three-around.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hesse-based state government opposed the participation of Helaba Bank.
The two remaining banking houses didn't connect that way either.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was acquired by Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Despite this, there has been repeated speculation about Deka-Bank’s merger with provincial banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba Bank, commented negatively on the merger of his financial house with others.
However, it seems that independently the belief that the rap connections of the various banking houses of the public sector are a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the provincial parliament in Bavaria, BayernLB's connection with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could start to be drawn first.
This is not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure to further fusions are to increase, it is gradually losing possible partners for such a connection.
In the south, only the second violin would play, even though it faces the financial crisis significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Association of Savers and Hessen-Thüringen Banks banned the connection with WestLB, which has an eighty-five percent stake in Helaba.
The Nord LB would be considered at most.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions are tuned together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should be ensured the future competitiveness of the provincial banks, the German Savings Banks and Giracon Groups has not yet responded.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which of course no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, in the letter of the local board of directors, there is talk about trying to "comprehensive solutions" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to combine it with the connection of individual components with Deka-Bank, time will tell.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "weekend with Italians"
For Elena this is the first time, for Luca for the third time or the fourth time.
But this time Elena will be like his girlfriend, so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the Kaiser five-litre barrel, stands a thick beard and two hundred tourists at Oktoberfest prove how deep tones his throat can release.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Purota Nuova Station, four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will leave this evening at 23.45, the expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, on one bus there are exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And that's how loud, Marco Guarda says, it's nothing for the Italians.
Marc, who is wearing a long coat with a lining of imitation fur and glasses with wide silver frames, the three buses belong.
He has been going with them for five years at Oktoberfest, only this year he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 22.30 departure back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The path costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast with a Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Cleanness Act, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go out into the night, after the car and the "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus quickly shuts down, the passenger is asleep.
They're doing well, they're still going to need their strength.
It is built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many other buses with an Italian license plate take one more break on the road number 8, a short distance before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are picking up, Marco has his last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on a yellow hat.
On it, on the left, the "Oktoberfest" says, next to the internet address of the Marco travel agency: "conoscersiviagiaginido.it".
Second, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls into the morning air.
"Food!" Go and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so that you don't get in the way, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, place yourself around the space!"
Máz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the players that we're behaving decently.
Once you leave your seats, they are gone!”
Third: "Just one night at six-thirty, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps such as signs on trees, signs and even on the electoral poster of one large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for retreat.
As a "weekend with Italy" is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Exact details about the number of visitors are not available; there is talk of fifty thousand who go on a journey through the Alps and fit into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy.
The Munich police will strengthen seven police officers from the southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps a national statistic in which Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Especially popular with Italians is the tent Hofbräu.
Sleepless nights for lenders Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis development.
This was the last weekend.
The Tax Index-led financial house specializing in the financing of property Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan of several billion to protect against turbulence in the markets from a consortium of German banks.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid would go up to 35 billion euros.
Interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) on a truly exhausted amount.
The money comes from private and public-law banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a news report, this state financier refinanced himself for the long-term projects for which he lent money in an extremely short term, which is now not possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and its share of equity from 1.6 to 1.45 percent decreased slightly.
Current returns and net income from financial trades fell to zero compared to last year, yields on the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as the abolition of credit trading reserves fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the higher proceeds of the compensation for the subsequent clearing costs of the restructuring of the former group of Depfa and on the compensation of interest under the Tax Code and for the mediation of trade for the Groups, the sixteen percent decrease on the revenue side was still moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned himself on mortgages for sole traders, which were then excluded from the portfolio of services and further led by Aareal Bank.
Because it was too little earned in classical state financing, Depfa was then more strongly involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something off, and these depreciation will have a "fundamental material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have allowed themselves to be heard vaguely.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It was already shortened by two-thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier for state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depfa.
Stronger than other institutes depends on refinancing in the interbank market, because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, the source of interbank loans virtually dried up two weeks ago, as banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - about 50 billion euros - per year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the financial need for the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future, and the company is protected "from the influence of international money markets currently largely incapable of functions".
Other sources have said that this money is guaranteed to be refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, the Chairman of the Board of Directors Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
This is what shareholders and creditors of the bank hope.
But given the dynamics and inertibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely impossible that the loan does not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank seemed to stand before the insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, the bailout cannot, even preliminary, reassure passions.
The share price plunged 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond courses were well held.
While the preferential debts have practically not moved, they lose the odds of secondary bonds more significantly.
This applies mainly to the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and logically the bond with the maturity period after 2009.
The tiligence of the Hypo-Real-Estate originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the company by taking Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their due date.
But there may also be an impact in which almost no one dares to hope at the moment - the financial crisis will be surpassed in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become a mere just legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare a number of nights for long-term creditors, when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors can use the limit line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous financial years to the exchange rate revenues of later years for the purpose of the future payment of capital gains.
German Special Deployment Units Were in the Liberation of Hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were prepared, but there was no deployment.
Further details of the circumstances of the liberation of eleven in Egypt-ridden European tourists are gradually being brought to the public.
According to data from the ministries of defense and interior, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
According to the Ministry, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, squadrons of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and also experts in the logistics of the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were on the scene of the exemption.
According to another statement from the spokespersons of the two ministries on Monday afternoon, however, there was no need for German forces, because the kidnappers let their captives go and fled when they recognized the signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as support forces for the action on the spot.
"Fortunately, it didn't happen," one spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After the abduction in the desert area in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages in border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the exemption or possible payment of the ransom.
They are currently being saved in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the hijackers were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
Information is yet to be available in Berlin when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" all five tourists, even with special forces, should fly one of the Airbuses of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltropová is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the German woman is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the mangoes. On his new blog about an exchange stay, he tells about Japan.
“On the first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already out of my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take 40 minutes by train to the middle in Tachibana.
I had to find the trip myself, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiba is not as strictly given as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o'cate, and twenty minutes before nine o'cate begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before the lessons started, I should have introduced myself.
I am not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone 40 students in front of a class.
Since I haven't had a school uniform yet, I wore an old skirt of my host mom, plus a blouse, blue socks and black leather boots.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajónara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and in a week my birthday.
At that point, I was very happy to start learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were rumored, giggling and waving, and I could still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangoes.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly came into my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, she considered it an honor to be a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong came in, they literally showered me.
They spoke over each other and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone unpacked their bents.
My host mom also made me such a lunch box - and that's something different than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and a kind of fish in tofu batt.
I usually have no idea what exactly I am eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salted plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools aren't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives the boy a self-prepared bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes that the boy will be closer to the break during a snack.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Because it just fascinates me.'
After all, I like to read mangoes for years.
And to understand these comics better, I started to learn Japanese a little bit once.
I knew I was going to have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo's biggest city I've ever seen."
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has mostly dropped a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones index has fallen sharply.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the calls of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both sides have not been found a majority for the program, which should mitigate the chaos in the financial markets.
With dramatic action, the proponents desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on MPs to give their consent before the vote, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
This was due to investor fears that the state bailout could be forfeited.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose to fall sharply after the announcement of the collapse of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or cockroach flees from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it be verified whether they feel the same when they behave similarly to us?
The online journal "Edge" has been published for several years by the papers of well-known scientists.
In its series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you find true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else still being able to prove it, when we cannot prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we start to focus on a different kind and open questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter implausible terrain because the hardware does not match.
When the rat gets into danger, it does the same as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the side prefrontal cortex (due to its contribution to short-term memory and performance or control functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is a reason to believe that man is distinguished even from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden by the linguistic nature of a person: because so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on the language, language would surely affect it, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to know what consciousness in other animals looks like.
When, as something internal and subjective, cannot be measured or analyzed because of the special hardware based on our own experience, our exploration puts us at major problems.
Most of my outlets relate to the content of conscious experience, but besides, there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, to which Christof Koch and Francis Crick were addressed, focus more on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be either.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of a non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I infer them from the fact that an emotional system, such as a system of fear, is activated in the brain consciously its own activity.
Thus, what we refer to as "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) uses surgical memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely intertwined with those areas of the cortex, which are characterized by primates, and especially by humans.
In the connection with linguistic nature, a subtle gradation of perception arises, because through words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to credit them side by side to others.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortexe and the brain stem dedicated to body sensations, similar to the Yak Pankseep, which, however, concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in feelings perceived by several animal families.
In theory, I cannot resist it, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to us to be fearful by both organisms probably feels the same way: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep further says whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
Cockroach flees from danger - does he feel fear too?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the conformity of experiencing.
It is true that a neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have similar brain strains, while cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in a person: how would we want to prove it in a rat?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who know?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the language), I rather examine emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and in people.
Just as I don’t examine language and consciousness with rats, I don’t even examine feelings, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be considered short-sighted, but I would rather move forward than repeatedly throwing myself against the wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: The deadline of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said the preparations will soon be directly managed by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"It's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early implementation of the time plan for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championship will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the president of the Ukrainian federation, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep following us."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN union was dismissed after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent caretaker Roberto Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiec.
He said there is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
"UEFA President Michel Platini has been assured by letter that this step will not be prepared for the 2012 European Championship."
Several teams from the Premier League were only doomed to forced relegation last season due to manipulations, eventually having to be moved the start of the league in a hurry.
Travel agents record increasing rates of bookings
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the turnover for next months for booking tours for the previous year increased significantly - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic growth, the appetite of the Germans remains unmistakable.
For bookings for the winter season, travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DV) reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
According to the DV, the turnover was about eleven percent higher for October compared to 2007.
The basis for these results is GfK numbers, which each month evaluates the booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and interpolates them into the overall market.
This result included bookings, which took place by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the U.S. is mainly required, the DDRV said.
For these trips, the increase in bookings makes about one-third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters, are particularly popular with the Germans.
Above all, organized tours are on course, said the chairman of the DRC Klaus Laepple.
With regard to rising energy and food costs, the costs here are "more easily calculated for the client than for an individually organized holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by leveraging discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so there will be a higher turnover again compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who took some trip decreased compared to the previous year.
The outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new movie, she talked in an interview about private things - and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her ex-degree Dennis Quaid as a marriage subversive.
He's rages and he's back on the blow.
Delayed rose war with former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors have a nasty controversy - in front of the public.
In an interview with InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she learned about the scale of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's response to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: He's "mad," the fifty-four-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews up the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
Moreover, it is "foodful" that the joint sixteen-year-old son Jack again "publicly reminds us of the pain and radical changes that for every child is divorce."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his thoughts on the wraption as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I think it’s a happy one that I have an amazing family that’s doing great.”
Flights and hotels prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent, according to one recent study.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on the reservations made from the first half of 2008 and after the rise in prices in the first quarter, it found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have been rising for several years, the accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The cause of this trend is the weak exchange rate of the dollar, which caused the "decreasing appetite of American tourists to travel."
The decrease in hotel prices was also more strongly affected by financial centers than industrial centers, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent even to the European record.
Also, ticket prices showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, demanding long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent on fuel.
From April to June, ticket prices in Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes, the changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew 11.9 percent, falling 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German national years, according to the cited study, prices fell by half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which has liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the interference of non-renewable flights by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge the Failsable landing for representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player was not involved in the game until late and failed with a stick balloon.
His message was precisely formulated and sounded convincing from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the corridor of the Hamburg arena.
There was not much happening in the catacombs, the break between the half-times ended, and most people were sitting in their places again.
Rieger was a physiotherapist for almost three decades and enjoys more respect than many moments of age.
And so his plea was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach's assistant Cornic Jol agreed and lifted his thumb as a sign of a consensus.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably the same: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It wasn't really looking at everything here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even the Bastian Reinhardt would have "better" it.
For 1:0 (1:0) The Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petrić (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Glad Bassians could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
This Monday, the SV Hamburger will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the live-renewed table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as the premier.
It's gonna be a birthday with no big party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the ongoing spreadsheet symbolizes the incalibility of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians of Nevese and Silva, the goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern acquired by Jansen - is slowly finding itself, but he is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribling," Jol said emphatically.
My first Oktoberfest
Indefinitely repeated pop, beer from tullers and prominents in costumes from well-known designers.
For the first time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV presenter, and she wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we are not even three minutes on a beer meadow, and photographers are already throwing themselves at us and agilely filling memory cards - that flatters me, I'm at Oktoberfest for the first time.
That's how you can make friends.
It seems that my cheap costume has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage? and so my feeling of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing a woman's costume or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Special views at the banana stand in chocolate are only harvested by my apron.
One Munich woman warns me that I misunderstood her: "On the left you are free, in the middle of a virgin, right-handed, widowed in the back."
I'll just sweep the bow from the back to the left.
"Okay," he says, laughing.
Others don't deal with subtle flirting techniques so much, and they're wearing simple felt hats with the inscription "To drunk to get dressed!" and sticking out on passers-by naked asses.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he is from England and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with an extended "óóó".
That's what he tells me after he's relieved himself of a just drunken oah.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are rubbish bins.
Bob is one of the troubled "Wildbieslers," as people in Bavaria say in public.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'pocall, there are in droves by the occult, where Oktoberfest takes place, in droves, who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in swarms - in four they wear a covered stretcher from the tent to the tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Whoever lies under the sail of this coffin from the pardon is not visible.
"That so, who can't go on," one of the medics calls me in answer to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After defeat in the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the rescue package caused a drop in the Dow Jones index by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, Dow added something.
Around 20.30, this world's most important stock market barometer showed a five percent decrease to 10 579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent.
The worst off was in Dow, the American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs shares lost nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett had a stake in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called corrupt mortgage papers are to be made available.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive the shareholder options of financial companies, which could be reimbursed with favourable exchange rate developments, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock exchange rates in Europe are falling sharply
Billions of assistance to banks in Europe and the US does not give investors away from investors.
The share price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly descending and is withdrawing the Dax index.
The U.S. Dow Jones is losing the state despite a planned bailout of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have slashed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The shares of the Munich real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of its value despite the bailout of the Federal Government and private banks, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have gone to their knees.
In New York, a business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the $700 billion U.S. government's $700 billion rescue package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, at 10,809.25 points during the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could say 1. October.
Other European stock exchanges have gone only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12 595.75.
In MDAx, after announcing the increase in capital, Arcandor shares lost.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
In addition, the sales and tourism concern announced that it will not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the years of space probes
For years, scientists have not known advice on a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the velocity of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravity slingshot).
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein might not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" has flown through space.
Due to the fuel lines, which will soon freeze, she is now at risk of dying by cold.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a cosmic body, such as Earth.
Thanks to this, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar spacecraft.
But what the scientist has been saying for years in this case in astonishment: flying bodies are not acted one hundred percent in the way one would expect it under the good old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
Probes accelerate or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of the gravity slingshot.
Several experts fear that even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The answer for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of dark matter for about a decade.
It is based on an obviously gravitational force, the effect of which can be observed on other cosmic bodies.
On the contrary, she herself is completely invisible, which means that it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, a fifth of the total mass of the universe is good from this dark matter.
Affected by tourists in Egypt
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to an Italian foreign minister in Egypt, the abducte tourists are once again at large.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were said to have been killed in the shootout before the release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists appear to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We're just verifying their health," Frattini said.
According to the report of Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are well and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the background of the firefight before the hostages were released: according to the Egyptian security worker, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese military surprisingly killed six hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted worker said.
It was already "just a matter of taking over the hostage," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese troops on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot dead six hijackers and two of them captured.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" cited one of the German intermediaries said the release of the hostages was stretching because the kidnappers fear for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages of the female gender after paying the ransom.
The men should have been kept until the hijackers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police release name of the victim of the accident
The name of a sixty-three-year-old woman who died in hospital after a car was hit by a car in Essex.
An accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson of the Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a fifty-one-year-old man was detained on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was already released on police bail.
Abuse by the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Several years of abuse by stepfather led the woman to kill herself, he was heard in court.
After pleading guilty to eight sexual harassments, Michael Tririse of Stitzians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in Cornwall.
The Crown Court in Truro heard his half-daughter Stephens, Randle, regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in the confession.
It was also said in court that Miss Randle killed herself in her home at Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Treris tied her up and tied her eyes and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother was working in a pub.
Trerisu and his wife divorced in the 80's and returned to Cornwall.
His half-daughter went to Plymouth.
But it was said before the court that Miss Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by the phantom of the abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 the friends of Miss Randle, who also devoted herself greatly to surfing and cycling, that she was "emocatively dead" and that she "did up her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She suffocated herself with a plastic bag.
Randle came face to face with his daughter's half-father, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I tied her up and blindfolded her.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been terrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn’t done so, the matter would probably not have gone to court at all.”
"In particular, I would like to emphasize the consequences your crime on their daughter over the years, according to Stephanie's parents," he added.
"Apparently, she would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An official who has lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train on Waterloo at a time when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense affairs letterer Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many at Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unfamiliar location.
Credit unions face B&B debt
British credit unions may have to settle more than £80 million after the Bradford & Bingley bailout.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
Adrian Coles, Director-general of the Bargain Association (BSA), said it was "holiering" that the credit unions and their members must pay.
The fourteen-billion-dollar debt will eventually be repaid by the salvae of Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest that accumulates in the meantime will repay all 700 financial firms that take client deposits each year.
The Compensation Plan for the Bank confirmed to the BBC that all 59 credit unions are included in this issue.
It is humiliating that these institutions that behaved judiciously... now they have to repay some of the accounts of those institutions that were not nearly as judicious
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each firm should pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that credit unions should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury Department estimates that interest on debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the credit unions will have to find £81m to pay back the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Credit Union of Cooperatives Association, told the BBC that he was convinced it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved judiciously during the boom of the housing market now have to repay some of the accounts of those institutions that were not nearly as judicious."
According to the BSA, no pre-owned office since 1945 appeared.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the options to protect credit unions and their members from an account that could be essential," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, there will be interest for the full year to pay off, and that could be almost twice as much.
Given that credit unions are shareholders-free shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates in their accounts.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to try to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern shore of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Cona in the neo-Renaissance style.
Tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits astride at the end of the platforms with a tower on every corner of the front, indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vaulted cash register, you can no longer have doubts about the size of the business whose westernmost gate was the station.
The station was opened by the German consortium of Anatoly-Gladi Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, which was late in the game of empires, intended to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East with the help of this railway, which was supposed to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further into the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were invaded by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular forces.
Relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial forces advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for Hydarpasha.
In 1917, an ammunition train explosion destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbling and history bypasses it.
But today this gateway to Anatolia and beyond serves - at least symbolically - to enhance the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I was supposed to meet one of the leading AKP experts on foreign policy, Turkish MP Suat Kinniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a courging drive on the tracks, which was recalled by the old-world rhythms of the well-known documentary Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigms of the Turkish consensus.
In the west, she aroused suspicions, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main tent of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built in an unfolding suburb, surrounded by half-built department stores and power-to-power dealerships, where middle managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kinniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry, too.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its restraint.
Today he has to look east and west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It must have done both.
"But I'm sure there will be a moment," I asked, "when will Turkey possibly have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't wish for such a decision to have to take place."
Then he stressed what almost everyone with whom I spoke here said almost by heart: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the surroundings of the Black Sea are as much for the benefit of Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, take these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpasha station, after another mostly sleepless night, I was thinking about the two German lords Herr Ritter and Herr Cona watching this building stand up a century ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, largely, in Turkish hands.
And when I was waiting in the harbor for the ferry back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called the "sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least at the time there was not much doubt which continent would be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk will increase by five pennies per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-penical increase in price in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers are supposed to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect on the price of the price.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-premier rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajida to be released on bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegations that she had obtained more than fifty billion taka from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption brought against it.
Khalida Ziya, a longtime political rival Sheikh Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has asked that the local military-held government first give her complete freedom.
Letters say that while she was released on her word of honor to undergo medical intervention abroad, it is unclear, according to her discharge, she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say he will now appeal the Supreme Court to the High Court's order.
"The High Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying he does not need bail when he is already undergoing an examination released on an affidavit abroad," her defense attorney Rafique-ul Huq said in a statement.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return from abroad to the country for preparations for the December election.
A senior representative of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasína is to return home after 17. October.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to be allowed abroad for medical intervention.
Both Sheikh Hasína and Khalida Ziya both reject allegations against each other.
Fear of vaccination against polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200 000 children did not take part in the recent area vaccination against polio due to violence related to the Taliban.
The UN conducted vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she could not reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this had happened despite the Taliban’s promises that it would not attack thousands of vaccine workers or prevent them from working.
BskyB loses litigation over ITV
BSkyB lost a litigation over review of the Commission's competition decision ordering the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
BSkyB's appeals tribunal ordered to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission said that the share of BSkyB was thwarted competition and gave a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a store that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Bureau announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had misaligned the reasons for the independence of ITV and called on the Commission for competition to open an investigation.
Virgin Consortium boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the forced reduction in its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution to be disproportionate - mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation of the American Advocates' Affairs
The U.S. chief prosecutor has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where the report of an affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was fueled by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interrogated during the investigation lied to thwart justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a report: " Serious allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testified was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006 of their posts.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been dismissed due to weak performances.
However, it later emerged that the release of the lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the redundancies were motivated politically.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others have refused to investigate allegations of misleading voters against Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases on behalf of the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire because of the layoffs and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector general's report commented very critically on the role of Gonzales in the affair, saying he bore "main responsibility" for dismissal that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and "not engaging in the action."
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's door will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will come to the ceremony for his special gold award next weekend in London, said he was "honored" by the recognition gained.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nominations are led by the Coldplay group, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, head editor of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a single and highest reached the 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has held the charts for about nine years and sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name of the Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and was operated on in 2003 due to an irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later turned out to have a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many cabbies-veteran and long-time locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village and leads north of First Street without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic route.
There are no signs with street names.
In a regular atlas, it is practically invisible.
However, the aicle has an admirer.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
It wants Extra Place to pave and create a cleaner passage to shops and boutiques to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the abbreviated aisle simply because it was one of the last remnants from before the block was refined.
However, the Municipal Office for the Protection and Development of Development, which has a street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the land committee of the municipal community, representatives of the municipality and the company Avalon Bay outlined a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzerová, the district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant where the street will remain in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"Refunding and management proposals could be filed, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to re-pave the small street and plant seating seats, several of which would be used by a cafe whose interest in renting the premises the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, she does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Conservation Office, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the job of his office was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children, and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background of the photo on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers writing about the East Village refinery, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that the piece of public property, even if modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's disappearing New York (subtitle "The Book of Laymen: A Magnesium Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Extinction"), posted part of the story of Extra Place from the section Talking about the city that appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even by day and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and hammered windows, where a week-old newspapers are chasing in the ditches."
With a few exceptions, the aisle of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door, which once led to the CBGB, where today stands an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to the fresh batch of newspapers, there was an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that some kind of booster could come in handy.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thought some people underestimate the impressiveness of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in places dark, damp and disgusting."
Bilinguter Debate: immersion in English
In this edition of the section Focused on education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T will be. Izumi discusses the candidate's attitude towards bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, co-author of the book "Horror than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools".
Effectively reaching out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's education agenda proves this.
Obama's campaign notes that "Afri-American and Hispanic students are considerably less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
In order to fight such performance differences, Obama’s education agenda, especially, among other things, promotes “transitionive bilingual education” for those who are yet to learn English.
The question of Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes that languages other than English are used in the classroom, is no stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the Los Angeles East.
In the vast majority of cases, students of this school are Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are just learning English.
Despite this, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008, an incredible one-centicent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Nearly the same amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level in state tests from the English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than that Babies preferred.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Further, and Obama should notice this is the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are yet to learn English, according to Linda Mikels, the headmistress of Sixth Street.
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me: "We had tremendous success with one completely new pupil from Mexico - after twelve months you would have entered the classroom and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model, what should other schools look like with large shares of Hispanic and English learning pupils?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question a matter of course, but the educational agenda of his own party (The National Education Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education makes it clear to predict Obama’s answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he declared that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "You should ensure that your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday over fears that even the U.S. plan to save financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
Prices of term oil trades fell as low as 7 percent in the morning trading on the New York commodity exchange to $99.80 a barrel.
Since Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street as well as a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell almost as high as $90 a barrel earlier this month, then jumped on a wave of enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the presidency of Congress announced it had reached an agreement over the weekend over the largest bailout plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by the fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from the end.
In the latest episode of the advancing decay, the government announced that the Citigroup group would buy a Wachvia Corporation banking squad.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to a plan to save the economy "are showing incapable of reviving the market mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"Prospects for markets with global stocks, interest rates and currency rates have become very uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape contagion.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the US virus spreads around the world and especially to China.”
Analysts at the bank's cut their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower growth in the economy, and cut their forecasts of gasoline prices for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter breaks the team's record
After spending more in the Jets jersey for the past eight seasons than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a graceful ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the gloomy clouds over themselves with their troubled game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laverouese to a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, perfectly foreshadowing the afternoon in which their gradually developing collaboration moved forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter behind two other touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the game.
"It wasn't extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a good player.
We communicated well, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were throwing, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis intercepted a stray throw and returned it 32 yards to a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith selected another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumbl.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-bed goal from the field, gaining a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever gained in a quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was asked to describe the madness, he said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third one.
Many points have been scored in a short period of time.”
Rested Gebreselassie improves its world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile-long race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning a pleasantly flat track in a time of 2:03:59, he overwhelms his previous 2:04:26 time by 27 seconds, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselsassie, who is 35, set the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - breaking the world record or at least being a world champion at all distances from a metric mile to a marathon.
Last month, Gebreselssia missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon because he was afraid - from a hindsight perhaps too scare - that air pollution would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - won on Sunday Gebreselassie with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on longer tracks, the marathon record dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a calf spasms two weeks ago and skip a week of training.
The break obviously woke him up rather than delayed him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was in a little doubt today, but everything was fine.”
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, East African rival Ethiopia - because he said he was overly planning his races, he generally avoided world marathon peaks, relied on conductors as if it were a race on the track, and set world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselssia reached half in a time of 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell away, Gebreselssi were constantly chasing two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles before the finish of Gebreselssia, he last took and escaped Kwambai, who then finished in second place in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitankova, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany, completed an excellent year for the seventh fastest time in the history of 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain.
Thirty-six-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in a time of 2:24:14 last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games for something that was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she had ever run.
She ran the race cleverly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run into a big lead and then after about 18 1⁄2 of the miles she dragged them.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
Pride and Obstacles to the Life of Negroes in a Separate City
Hidden among the scattered theme parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquet playgrounds, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, plenty of swadddles, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Acenovil Festival to pay homage to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains aside, even though she made it a stop for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
He is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the country blacks in Florida often resisted and shared their true feelings with a white man who "families know so little about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate about races, many residents here remain cautious about the views of strangers.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historic model of black ascension and a community of nearly 2400 people, where the poverty rate is twice as much as the nationwide average.
It is a center of literature, but also oaks shielded by an example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - which originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the locals are both proud and conservation.
And the concern about Eatonville's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartbreaking books as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city a short walk to the road No. 17, which leads through the often-desired center of Florida, in the stage of black history and human drama.
With the vigor of the great drum in life and literature, Hurston led readers into the store of the first Acenovville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left next to the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-degraded modern national school with well-maintained yards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even if he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned Dash's new wife's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "solds drinks of all kinds and anything that fits the hour-long hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eetonville linked to the self-government, but also with illiteracy, marriage reconstitution and sex.
This was obviously not a typical publisher of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait everyone appreciated.
"Zera said it as it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the choir of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chip-free eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that mostly, when she rushed into town, she arrived unannounced in the vast Chevrolet, smoking and carrying pants in the city, which is still proud of dignified dressing today.
Most of the people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were sneered.
"People always like to see Zora," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "it never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Florida's Fort Pierce, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or major public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its importance to the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography "Wrapped in Rainbows," published in 2003.
The change came in the 80's of the 20th century.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city through a five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane main road.
Orland's raiding has already been pushed through the interstate highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, has ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for mixing races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady who killed it.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, and said that he was “for my race more than celebrating.”
Residents now say that the de-gegagment of schools, even though it was positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black children were used to hugs - I remember that - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," she said. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural barrier," Ms Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, uplifted themselves to prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can someone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker reached the unmarked Huston grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a praised biography by Robert E came to the shelves in bookstores. Hemenway, who reinstated her to the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
Former Hurston neighbors have now considered her a savior.
To show what a state could destroy with its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January many return to the party.
After several years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five streams of the highway resurrect, you would say it directly detonated, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said this more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Off-town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the local church in 1993, began to appear in larger numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Registry in 1998.
The new single-story library (named, of course, after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on the back-to-eater and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from the center of Orlando, it can sometimes act as a sunken alleury in the summer rain, as small as being founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today, 90% is black.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often handled with caution.
Permission for most interviews is necessary to have in advance, and certain things - as murals in the oldest Aceonville church painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many at Eatonville, like Jones, a courageous, confident teacher who likes a deep red, are still worried that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival swelled, home pride has also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, there is an honest love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police he says she would take any help.
And even younger, such as eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexio Kenon's, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, if he just goes through here, thinks, 'Uh, this city is nothing against the others,'" Alondra Kenon said recently after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently financier
Nothing has changed at first sight.
If Manhattan tourists stayed away from newspaper stalls and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realise they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glazed bee bee of offices over their heads, bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers still rumble with metal carts on the sidewalks and carry the mouffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers and carrying, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts that hang from the rocks on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at street dining stalls, and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab between four and seven in the afternoon on weekday.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all, until I, with all the talk of pessimism, decided not to open a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this task so that it would cover with a late afternoon siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about twenty people were already waiting in line.
Not in front of the checkouts to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter, where older clients order cheque books, tourists ask about the trip to the Macy's convenience store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starro, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
But compared to me, they have already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in the places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to building savings banks), money associations and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, and who claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have gone bankrupt.
A few days ago, the Washington Mutual, a $327 billion asset bank, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wakhovia, with $440 billion assets, was trying to catch a bailout buyer.
Employees of offices and shops who stood in front of me and feared another collapse were moving their cash into a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned financially fluent in the past week.
Some woman at my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone, expressing herself with Lehman Borthers, that failed bank, and to her emaciated chief executive Dick Fuld with the familialness of her as if she were scratching about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, uniformed roughly fifty-year-old housewives of my apartment building, changed the theme of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me: "I have my savings in money market funds now.
I've moved it, I'm not going to risk."
Mysterious Lives by Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guiluldord Musical Manager since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (an obituary, 9/11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district's musical plan, he founded a year later, the excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be under the age of 21, but by the time Proteus last sang in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we just refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape changeer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to embark on any music presented to it - whether madrigaly or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of the only man and enthusiasm for music that remained completely unchanging all the time.
How often Did told us to "leave the music for ourselves."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
Then sing it! " "
His baton technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be knighted, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them - and I was inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "did one or two soaked stones around the world."
Away from many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This comes from Woodruff's author's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he finished his dissertation on the British rubber industry, which was led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing turkey
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, he is taking part in a rally that presented the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that display mosques crossed out by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties made huge profits in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were badly damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming at the moment when the Muslim Lent is coming to an end.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering the wheel of the search for its own soul after traffic has swung in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which gained a combined total of more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, conducted a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested in the campaign against headscarfs and burqas, and even expressed his opposition to food that is perceived as a relationship with Islam.
At the last meeting with voters in Vienna, he talked about a "European fraternity" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that these are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right at the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed on a trip across the border
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star convicted of child sexually abusing, was banned from driving to France and Spain.
Officials imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he plans to travel through France to Spain.
Kent police were approved by this travel ban last Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter's past sentences for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford lowest criminal court in Kent, but was held by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A court service spokesman said: "Thursday, September 25, at the Ashfords' lowest criminal court, Kent police asked for an order that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd did not attend personally."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as required to him by a record of sexual attackers.
He has to report to the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They also have to hand over the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he omitted the obligation to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have said they would not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes in the county.
A Kent police spokeswoman said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that handle potential dangers more efficiently.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police and working carefully to monitor the behavior of recorded sex attackers to reduce any danger to the public to a minimum.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was due to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not let him pass the passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at the Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge-lowest criminal court in West London, while Scotland Yard successfully sought the order that required him to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months of possession of child pornography.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, is calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"For me to capture the true character, I photograph the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles or costumes.
Only the essences of the great flamenco masters, detached from the concentration on the interpretation - I just achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
An artist on one side.
On the other - man.
Indecision-free, apart from privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see an intimate gesture, the depth of a glimpse view or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree because they are not going to ascend to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatricality with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intent, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the program of the Moon of Photography of the flamenco (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-increasing international significance of flamenco," the author says, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photos, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transferring passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that will allow me to capture the personality of the giants of flamenco.
Enchanted by the festival "Cante de las Minas" Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait the flamencoco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble a classic photo.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the film and gives it the contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, mirrors flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, continues to surprise and evolve."
What draws viewers is not the action of the dance itself, singing or play, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most essential, with that spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experience, it was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the El Fotómata gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by well-known flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Hano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project became a kind of flamenco anthology and will soon be published, which will contain the exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer’s passion brought Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea of “Portraits of Sports Veterans”.
Although their concept is different from the "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "photographers, get to know them and have the opportunity to enter into their lives for a moment, whether longer or just a little, enter their lives - this is my passion.
I think in photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or collides with people, personalities that sometimes you do not even know, or give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alamade de Hércules, and can be visited until 16. October.
Vargas Llosa admits the novel he writes is "trouble"
It takes place in an environment he does not yet know, and tells about the events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and traveled in the Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently busy with it "is presumptuous," and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had sense, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it, and I believe I'm going to finish it one day," he concluded his post at a festival of exchanging ideas, ideas and words, which saw about a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city of aqueduct within four days.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the festivities of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, which won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the theater Juan Bravo to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a surrendered audience in front of him, whose hour of time passed like water - a Peruvian with amazing precision and a great deal of humor recalled how he was in it from the original "unbelievable adventure" from the "pleasure of a passionate reader" and "power to live more than what I have lived" was born a literary mission; how he substitutes "lack"He writes; or how they influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remember images" are the mainstay of his stories.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent the books can change their lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere fun, a fleeting experience" - emphasized Vargas Llosa, saying that he thinks "they affect people" and "force them to try to break out of line", and urged the writer to "not subject to frivolity" and "
Due to climatology, it loses the feast in Pozoblanc - there is a lack of spear
The appearance of the spears, which concludes the ceremony in Pozoblanc, was canceled yesterday morning after the announcement by the performers that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That is why the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfighting.
Unfavourable meteorological conditions have been plagued by this festivities for a long time, two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfights.
During them, the formations José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to stand up to the bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
That's how it was only celebrated on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance was taken on his shoulders.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two shots with a spies and one ear brought him more of an unhied seat in the arena than toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who went through the bull's lobby lake Lolanos unsweetened non-greasy.
In the second round of hardship without a single respite, he has received sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They ran out of control in Alava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes five.
Road control of Ertzaintz in the city district of Armiñón (Alava).
Members stop two people in the van and they run away from them.
The cost, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, members pursued them and detained one of the persons in the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out roadside checks on the N-1 in the places where the Armiñón district border passes.
They were going to stop the van in order to check, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply and drove away.
The car immediately began to prosecute the car until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few kilometers away, at that moment the two passengers jumped up and fled into the forested vegetation.
Ertzaintz's members eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting as it emerged during a tour of the Iveco Daily van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate is "crumpled" and did not agree with the data in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also charged with falsification of state documents.
Ertzaintza continues his search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The Retained A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to complete appropriate formalities before proceeding to further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear detained for drug driving
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the series Melrose Place, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for riding under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Road Watch told People magazine.
The witness said that around 16.30 p.m. Locklear "stretched on the gas, driving forward and backward as noisy roaring, trying to get out of the parking space - she ran over her sunglasses while reversing."
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear moments after stopping on a nearby highway and getting off the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "he was afraid for Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, she found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It looked disoriented," and that's why the members took her to a specialized drug and alcoholic center to undergo a test.
According to the police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately ruled out, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 19.00, even though she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety states and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in Silva case
The chief executive of the IU and MP for the United Kingdom, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that the final decision in the case of the former councilor of the Youth and Sports Department of Seville Francisco, Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being charged with the conduct in favor of his family, will depend on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares hinted at the negotiations, which the party will have to proceed with in relation to a former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that in the case of an investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, it was necessary to "transparency": "IU has always fought to ensure that such matters were as transparent as possible."
Likewise, he stressed that the party has a "strial code of ethics for all public functions."
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic bet by Garci
José Luis Garci in the film "May's Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by the Episodes of Benito's national past, revives the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "render the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the company", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film, before an extensive team of performers.
The May blood with a meritrae of over two and a half hours will be released this Friday, and in the future there will be a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid television.
As a great admirer of Galdós’ literary work, José Luis Garci claims that by making this film he fulfilled the “children’s dream”, for which he owes Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to make the film to mark the two-cententh anniversary of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer, saying that the plot would be based on Episodes of the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has completely contributed, means for Garci's "unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes corresponding to the image of "a frenzy Spain that was wrong in the leader for whom it was possible to fight - the struggle for independence led the country's decline and backwardness under Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the director regrets that he cannot count on the financial support that the films Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost double the Blood of May - could not shoot some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horaci Valcárcel, with whom he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Vover and Ephezar) works as he is commonly used to - on the scene along with the actors he usually tries before filming and who he does not choose by casting, because it seems "humiliating" to him and also believes that "part of the director's profession is, among other things, to go to theaters and cinemas and thus learn what is happening in the craft he is engaged in."
Many of the actors he selected for the Blood of May appear several occasions in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscar nominations, one of whom has won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Flower Blood itself, the Seven Tables of French Billion and the last selected Blind Sunflower, does not represent a young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "they are yet to appear".
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this film.
"At first you think you're working for what happens next, but then you realize you're working for a profit just, so you submissive yourself to make one more movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bayon revives spiritual legacy of Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
Seville dancer flamenco will pay tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, father of Catalans (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved with her family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life full of passion, she was a pioneer of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she fought to abolish a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the interwar of the interwar of the Isabel Bayon was fascinated by the life of the dance and aesthetic revolution.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed unbelievable."
According to the dancer, "we are not about telling her life, but about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "flyer of the butterfly" evoked me guajira or "dance of the snake" some thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also corresponds," she claims.
The performance envisages the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poved, who will sing in one performance as well as in the "Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and with dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde introduces the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I'm happy to accept the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
In the performance, he also envisages the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Pac Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; drums of El Pájar, the villa of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Juárez, "who has the role of an eternal guide to this kind of female artist, who are always prima donnaises, and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for her time in such far-flung places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at a certain time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work," Bayon said.
The performance begins today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vegy Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina "Flamence and Life" because his documentary black and white photography is amazing.
They attracted me with the simplicity and strong charge with which they affect the audience, and the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino can capture magical moments."
The book "The Diary of the Freshly Married" concludes the triennial
The first illustrated edition of the "Diary of the Freshly Felled" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez entered into a marriage to Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andaluist government to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the aim of celebrating the 50th anniversary of their donation.
The "trienacles of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" are coming to an end with the new publication of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: One Ray of the Sun", which was opened in May this year, and after going around the various Andalusian provinces, it should be moved to New York City as planned.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Diary of the Freshly Married" modified by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Eccis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most worldly Andaluian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like itself so much
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without Evil Intention" and under the weight of knowing that Newman has left, reveals her dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all over America.
Look how it took them to get Oskar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that it was known to be very ill.
He was a man for everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't be expressed in any way, and I've now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid that he would be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of the film and the country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when reasons for pride are desperately sought.
When the times are harsh and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worth admiring - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from a foundation against drug addiction based on honors of the first-born son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of homemade food and organic food.
A complete treasure for a country that cost a lot of effort to free yourself from the suicidal dietary culture.
A tumultuous wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that one man did not die, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning leader for Directing Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the pinnacle of his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has put on a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lived today - he prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he was married to Joanne Woodward, who was loyal to, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a fillet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be proud in heaven for the resonance between his daughters and admirers to rule the earth - this is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he has embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a self-sacrificing philanthropist."
Imperfect Olympic Madrid races
Yes, many of us are eager to have the Olympics held in Madrid, and after the failed year of 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we follow yesterday's race, I say: no!
He was referred to as a perfect race, and in my opinion he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a bunch of nonsense that immediately, if it came to evaluation and I was a rehearsal, it would be clear inadequate.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty much one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up the race number, for which one has to go out early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give him everything (including a chip to prevent overaccomplishing the track).
Oh, no, no.
Here you had to pick up the number first (the first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after standing the right queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
They decided to buy only small T-shirts because of the crisis, because it is less fabric and they are cheaper?
Okay, but those are little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very soon for the chip and the queue on it lasted over 15 minutes, he still had to hand over a backpack there.
Over 35 minutes lasted a waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at the race, where 11 000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put our backpacks on yet, and when we've done it, picking up it was much worse.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes by rain, which led to general revolt and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not show the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, as I assume, did not record the time of the launch correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't have occurred to me.
And so I believe that we will have to let us dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new image recognition system and human interaction in the manner of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company's premises) and perceive what it hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "reception" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort those present by conversation groups.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third party and understands that she does not belong to the group that talks to her, and that it is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see someone, and tells her she'll be attending to her in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
Breathtaking.
But that, of course, is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without a burden on commercial uselessness, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discovery like thunder, considering that Microsoft from version adds new features to Windows and more "extra".
Changing the direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned toward the theory that it was Google's first move to rival competition with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative to the truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, more of an Internet browser.
The computer is turned on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What is half the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 needs to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
I took this photo in one rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drinker was a poster asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future.”
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count on 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more of a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one glowed in Edward Zwick's "Bloody Diamond" as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Butter" and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to start listing his life roles, we can immers ourselves in the image of a typical musculature with a pointed moustache that lifts the dumbbells in the nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's underkind tank top, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call him a 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out above all the others.
First, for his breakneck name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which has a connection with sport, because, as the legend tells, was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the love of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguishing label and (almost imperishable) Belgian flag, which has the models of the most elegant tank tops as a neck detail.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not only specialize in the tops tank.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, children's outfits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to just be underwear.
They're too beautiful.
Honda attacks its bestseller for the second time
In the month of November, Honda will start selling the second generation of the Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This includes improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes in this single-space car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case with Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year's 2008.
It is in Japan that almost a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market was the old continent with about half a million sold pieces in six years.
Honda, however, aims to boost the new Jazz's sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 the estimates are 100 000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% on the European market.
In terms of the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 5,000 Jazz models since 2002, which translates to 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2 000 pieces for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to significantly ease the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the carmaker thus expects to finish the year with a total of 22 000 units sold, which means 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% from last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects it to reach 2%.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is the Honda Insight, a five-door compact-sized hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company expects to sell around 200 000 units per year worldwide.
In terms of markets, according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight will sell in the United States, while the remaining percentages will be divided by the old continent and Japan.
The launch of the Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year as soon as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions have increased in the new Jazz.
Its length increased up to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase of the axles to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
On the contrary, the height did not change and is still 1.52 meters.
By increasing the dimensions, the interior space was also increased.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - increased up to 399 liters, 19 litres more than the volume of luggage compartment at the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage compartment volume at the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping the glazed panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the 80-degree opening angle compared to 67 in the first Jazz.
For the second generation of the Honda Jazz, the engines are also new.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4-liter gasoline engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which enables lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and deliver excellent improvements to the drive system at the same time with high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter engine has a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 hp for the previous generation of the Jazz - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which has reached 83 hp for the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
The Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 hp combined consumption and a combined power of 5.2 grams of CO2.
“I want to be a young mother. Whoever will be a father does not concern me.”
The enormous remncleation with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though tiny figures, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than just that some pretty, famous girls lend their name.
In Paris, she attended a promotion organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as announcing the most important fashion prizes that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartfelt and timid, and she'll win you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I took part in the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera House in honor of Valentino.
It was a difficult, but also an exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
Me and my sister love films from the 50's and 60's and we drew many stimuli from them.
I also love wandering around the city and watching women walking dressed, how they combine and casting up their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
For example, I liked clothes since I was a child, I still wanted to go to my grandmother, to go through my aunt’s closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I wears.
You know that we dancers pride ourselves on how well we are to feel good in our classes and rehearsals when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You're 30 recently, did the crisis hit you?
No. No.
I feel better than ever before, I enjoy thirty.
I find that the woman is ready, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
Since I was a child, I do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides that I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As far as my father is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the movie, you're going to have several premieres of the movies you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the cinemas.
I come from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restlessly, I want everything right now and of course I can't.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "La harmonium Mountain" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the catwalk alongside Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the pier like a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to take part in a benefit parades for her organization "The Women for a Better Life" organization, and the clothes we showed - I also chose two models from our collection for Mango - it was auctioned, and the proceeds were handed over to this NGO to this NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said about her, and I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good that he's engaged in.
She asked me to do my best for charitable purposes, but when he asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it, too.
For the benefit of third-world women, I will do what is needed.
"Car bee" prevents collisions
This time, Nissan was inspired to advance in the development of anti-inclusive technologies in nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes as a pattern of bee flying, preventing collisions.
This is Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Center for Technical Advances by Nissan Motor Co. robot, in collaboration with the Centre for Advances in Scientific and Technological Research, Japan, developed the prestigious Tokyo University of Japan.
According to Kazuhir Doie, CEO of public relations for technology, brand research and development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan's four zones of the Nissan security shield.
The robot is designed to strengthen the ability to prevent precipitation in the car of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
The most important, however, are folded bees, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
Engineers, when creating this visual function, designed what they called the laser localizer (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles that are located up to two meters in a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is recorded, the robot imitates the bee movements and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels to the right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction in which it is allowed by rotating its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as with bees.
Therefore, in addition to acceleration and slowing, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robots from colliding.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act according to these data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, thanks to which it can function without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we don’t talk about gigs or mega in our memory.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of precipitation, a technology that Nissan predicts use in series cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the incorporation of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles on the road.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car drunk or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the driver to the wheel, so drivers will also have to undergo a course of traffic education.
In addition to the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technology Institute for the Safety of Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists charged more than once for drunk driving, they will get behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the start-of-car if the driver does not breathe before or if a higher-than-permitted concentration of alcohol is recorded.
Its price exceeds 1 000 euros and the culprit himself would have to pay for it.
A study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device decreased by 65% during the first year since the introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in the offence.
And in order to help its implementation, because the legislation can be carried out in the usual way, but the necessary regulation of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been reinvented in some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the PSOE proposal (Spain Workers' Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40, as it stood on the agenda, it landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez airport in Mexico D. F. an aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, in which the prince and princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays had so far forced its eyes to be visible to see the heirs of the plane.
Under the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it won't get to the airport at that time to pick up people... She's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's a Spaniard, but she's lived here for years.
- Yeah, so yeah...
But the Mexican press knows who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorable vol.
The prince appears with a smile on her lips in a suit of dark blue color and a princess, very spatter-fitting and with her hair flowing, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. threatens thunderstorms.
Before they cross into the hall where the official delegation awaits, they smile at the photographers and kiss them casually.
At the door of the hotel where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a chatty Mexican TV reporter awaits them.
Enjoy the Fear Before Taking a Mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having enough capital to give out injections, is also lacking ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages at banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular-educational game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or "The Hotel of Bad Credit"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and especially its receptionist, look grim, so that one can think twice or three times about whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably its intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than space for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
There will be a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because you better not talk about buying a house...
The best subsidized fashion price
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris, and it is probably not an exquisite designer and bonviván than Valentino.
Mango has just announced its second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to provide an international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is subsidized by 300 000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga window at the Haussmann Boulevard 54 in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest deal of this company in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1 335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank designer Valentino for taking charge of the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to eventually sullen dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
The company Mango's festiously decorated chairstress table looked even more amazing next to Chagall's most outstanding works.
Nati, who showed nothing to her heartbreak with a heartbreaking grief because of her brother's recent death, put on the clothes of this brand and ELAH jewelry, over which he held his breath, and hung in her son Luis - an all-by-two-year-old elegant - accompanied Valentino at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome, and as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild remained without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - self-designed - pants and shirt and dressed in a long black sexy dress for dinner, touched a night walk around the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, she showed us the hall for ballet rehearsals, and while remembering other times, she grabbed one of the bars and hinted at the "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stay for a tour of the next building of the palace, but before leaving, she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning, we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man who rides a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no scents were used in his rooms.
Stars under the starlight Parisian sky.
Oh là là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about a chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And to be short, they are all summarized in one book, which will bring to the bookstore on September 30, relax.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there is not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of detachment from the world of work.
No, the number is no greater and no less than 1001.
In addition to yogi positions, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, Susannah Marriott has gathered the whole "menu" of possibilities, adapted to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstores.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve calm in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this opinion.
In addition, it offers other ways to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have an adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, switch off and focus on reading.
Talking from Sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may startle you, but it's actually meaningless.
It is a harmless sleep disorder called somniocovina.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure you told many of you that he was talking at night from sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime of high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every month...), the next day the baby does not remember anything.
There is only one reason to explain her onset.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime fury, enuresis nocturna (night bedwetting) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stressful or excitable situations.
In any case, it is a little-explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where he manifests himself with great strength, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him a great deal of anxiety and manifests himself in this way.
We said it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do that we will keep in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the baby too much before going to sleep.
So to look for quiet games and avoid scary or rather violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them to gain a certain inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somniocovina appears, try to remain calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that from what was happening, the next day he will no longer remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It is useless because it is not conscious and you will interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if you think that several times in a row, it would be advisable to turn for advice or find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If it is to understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and carry information from it.
It will be useless, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious to be able to organize her thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks about, and why he says it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Just don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
After a long skinny period, Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-right created more chances and were able to turn one of them victorious.
The game did not have too fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to assert themselves.
After the first attempt of captain hosts Kauffmann, who shot from a distance only a hairlong with a balance, Illhaeusern began to have a slightly upper hand, and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irrit the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive rampart in the middle of the pitch and left only the agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names of Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well-positioned for processing the ball deflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, the goalkeeper of Illhaeusern did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his teammates in the weakening.
Dannemarie, however, failed to make the most of it, and the eleven from Illhaeusern, who only withdrew a little bit to "magnex" the defense, no longer caused any more trouble, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after a lot of confusion.
Sarkozy goes to angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a ride through Brittany.
To face a demonstration of the strength of fishermen, who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports, the French president decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "wins with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen in order to get measures against a sharp increase in oil prices, which peaked at an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions for employing and paying sailors.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they performed the operation "navel" (operations of slow-motion vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of congestion.
The holiday port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filtration dam was launched on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors demonstrated their determination on Monday, when tires and pallets fired at dawn in front of the fuel depots of ports in Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the la Manche canal, like to the Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where the traulters remained in the harbor, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped a blockade of an important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before they decide to act on their own.
Guilvinec is due to decide on Tuesday how to continue the journey and its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state fisheries department, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not abandon anything" and "will not come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the fisheries department in Lorient.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay diesel tax are currently around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the threshold for the return of the ship is only reached when the oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman spectacular
An unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kid" has died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes bowed to the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
Brazil's aircraft maker relies on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that hovers over the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains his assumptions of deliveries for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, confirmed by its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially in mind the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients in a span of eight years.
AIG is considering assigning 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which U.S. money authorities have received over the water, are considering advancing more than 15% of its assets to pay $85 billion that were given to him as a down payment, the Financial Times reports on Sunday.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance policies and pension activities in the United States, the daily clairs, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to the FT, the AIG board met on Sunday evening to examine the eventual assignment.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmation declaration from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its affiliate of the International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the security of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its property portfolio and investment in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision on these assignments has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly earn cash in order to repay the $85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve, with the risk of the U.S. authorities seize 80% of its capital, while diluting the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange saw a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to bake banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14 per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 to 10.65.45.
The largest slump in its history to date (at 684.81 points) recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technological component lost, according to the definitive data after the trading deadline, 199.61 points and settled at 1 983.73, and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.18% (i.e. 106.85 points) at 1 106.55.
Disheartened since the start of the meeting, Wall Street literally plummeted after an unexpected rejection of the plan to bail out the bank by the House of Representatives, a plan to allow a little stability to be found again in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson with the funds he asked for.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to a market that sees Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market has relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late."
“If this project is really doomed to extinction, the baton will be handed over to the Fed and other central banks to prevent the crisis, which would strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head economist at Global Insight.
And with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, "every new day brings the fall of one financial institution."
After Friday's collapse, Washington Mutual was orchestrated by the authorities to buy the banking activities of the Wachovia bank activity by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis abruptly took a turn and required urgent interventions in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not “only with an American crisis, but a world crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The revenue from the cashier's voucher for 10 years fell to 3.632% versus 3.827 percent on Friday evening, the yield to 30 years to 4.161% versus 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to raise 21% of its capital, is entering its center. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant decrease in his exchange rate.
A week after revealing their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of normal Morgan Stanley shares at a single price of $25.25, a total of three billion dollars.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in raising convertible securities to provide a 10% yield and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the operation will take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Yet Morgan Stanley shares lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 around 17.00 greenwich time.
"This strategic merge represents an important opportunity to speed up Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a banking holding," explained John Mack, CEO of the US group.
The new status was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is intended to diversify its activities, but at the same time it puts it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest aces of Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms, presented on Monday, show that the deal has been amended over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's chief executive, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of ordinary stocks.
However, given the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to reduce the risks to a minimum and also to cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for Morgan Stanley securities than their book value.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings from the stock by about 20%.
The agreement envisages MUFG to convert half of its preferential securities into regular shares in a year if the latter will be exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50 percent in excess of the exchange price, i.e. for about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that will bring MUFG will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, a group spokeswoman declined to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to boast a Tier One payment-avaluation ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "bentened" his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with the debt have skyrocketed.
These costs took the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "survivable" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch buyout, that it had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing a republic around socialism of the 20th century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorean Correa.
Last Sunday, the third appointed one submitted a proposal for a new Constitution for a vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is fulfilled, because 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
"No" received 28%, according to these results, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order for the Constitution's draft to be adopted, he had to get half the vote, plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit from polling stations and the calculation of the NGO predicted a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, situating them in the range of 63% to 70%.
After all, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday Monday.
"The Constitution won the whole line," he assured, congratulating Ecuadoreers at the Guayaquil's Gurayquil headquarters headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It is self-supplied that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the Monitoring Mission of the Organization of the United States of America (OEA), took place peacefully, covered by a text of 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution sanctifies the power of the state over economics by preserving it the "planning of the development" of a country living primarily from the mining of diesel by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal backed by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free health and education, which the president began to implement in a country with 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of U.S. anti-drug operations.
Obama wins on points in first televised duel
The first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday was followed by a second debate to find out which of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The command tents of the Republicans' and Democrat campaigns were not surprised when they both declared their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent he was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday attributed to Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters they matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attributes victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the anticipated good performance of his co-candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his opponent Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time emphasizing the "naiveness" of his opponent on issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama has not understood that..." was the repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has sufficient experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican TV spots have been carried since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He didn't lose his head and proved himself concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still misunderstood, while Obama did," he said over the weekend, a Democratic spot that reproaches the Republican for not taking the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20 000 people gathered at a pre-election meeting in North Carolina in heavy rain.
Nor did he say words like "middle class" or "workers." Financial disintegration unequivocally favours Obama, whom Americans see as more afflicted to save the economy on the edge of the abyss.
"The decisive reversal could be given next week," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, likened Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democrat nominee, the current catrift is "a final verdict of eight-year ill economic policy, as George Bush ran it and supported by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator has reaffirmed that despite the unexpected Wall Street jumps, he could reduce taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the realisation of the country's eventual energy independence by enforcing renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion financial aid plan, which was accepted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, have you noticed that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closure of polling stations in the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the polls: “What good would it be if they do what they like with my voice anyway,” says a young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has acted with a welcoming one to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to carry out a turnaround towards democracy.
The penalties, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We have been held further away from the Electoral Commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, complained of a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "be since the essential is who counts the votes, and in our country it is an executive power.
If some opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "there is a need to start a dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, will be affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, not to declare the elections valid.
It emphasizes that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"What about you, have you noticed that any elections have been held?" asks the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There wasn't even a foot on the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who best suit the regime."
The night silence took place again in the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
19 hostages were freed in Chad
The Egyptian commando took the attack of the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight-member entourage, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were fed and healthy to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
During the morning, they were liberated by the Egyptian commandos in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft to the military base of al-Maza, closely adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken over without being able to speak in the press, on board the helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the peripheral residential neighborhood of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "the kidnappers have not been paid any ransom," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zohyr Garrana said on the airway.
Since its capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages have been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard of the Aegyptous agency director, an organizer of safari.
A leading official of the Egyptian security forces indicated that 30 members of the special forces approached the scene on board two helicopters set off during the night just before dawn.
"A firefighter, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is currently in touch, mentioned the role played by secret agents and the Italian special forces.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of the people of our secret services, special forces," he said without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the Saudi army declared that in the patrol it seized a four-wheel-drive vehicle on board, carrying hijackers, killing six, including the Chadian commander and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The quiet majority of the Culture Resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with inch headlines and is the topic of the ongoing election campaign.
The better.
One area of our cultural life, however, is still neglected.
Who will rise to denounce the poor sums provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and nationally monumental places that perish the hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government of neglecting its monuments and its historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is donating three and a half million euros to the restoration of just Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the Americans, and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in synergy.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Québek History, at least 40 000 volunteers grouped into 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy about uncovering history, preserving a pile of private archives, and servitude of archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often these companies are the guarding dogs of our monuments, driven by hopelessness, protesting when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see a grandstand for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood that's sure
Heme-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the founding and its president, dr. Francine Décary, she was rightly rejoicing because Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the public's trust, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 80's and 90's.
As is widely known, the state reserve of blood managed by the Transfusion Department of the Canadian Red Cross has been contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) virus and hepatitis C virus during the 80's.
Given this drama and the wave of public resentment, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate a recommendation that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed the report, some provinces set the run-to-equipment of a committee aimed at planning a new blood administration system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee held this role.
After the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was supposed to be managed by Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for supplying all provinces and both territories.
"When hem-Québec started its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," recalls dr. Décary.
“The situation was daunting.
By a stapling effort to increase the safety of blood products and the constant work in this area over the coming years, we have regained the public’s trust,” he says, adding proudly that at the beginning of 2008, Héma-Québek’s nearly 94% of the Quebec population trusted Héma-Québek.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight that "confidence is something very fragile".
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
“At that time, we witnessed many cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Yoib’s disease,” says the woman, who has been leading the company since its foundation in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread through blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau's report, according to which when we do not know this and when the spread of a serious illness is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take an exclusionary measure.
In April 1999, we refused blood from people who had stayed in the UK since 1980 for more than a month.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the principle of prudence was meaningful.”
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV-tested technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests that make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself in the donor blood directly, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used before.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period, which occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when the first viruses can be detected by our blood techniques, explains the specialist.
We have been able to short-term this period to less than a week.
We have made a substantial reduction in the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
The risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood is now exposed to one in 12 million.
“By other words, it means that before someone becomes infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400 000 to 500 000 blood products every year, it will be 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary to heal," says the head of the management of Héma-Québek.
“The challenge for the next decade is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what a diseased element can appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by stinging insects.
We need to be careful all the time," dr. continues. Décary and stresses that in addition to the safe supply, Héma-Québec must also take into account sufficient supply.
“Supplies are growing because the population is aging.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% Québeccas permissible for donation."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering blood are not accepted because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and whether they have visited a country where mud chills are ruled out for a year.
“With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the network of donors need to be replenished in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
But persecuting people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and instigated them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and freeze before they are stored in Heme-Québek, which also manages a single public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, abounds with cetal-rich blood, which can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of blood samples from the umbilical cord to the bank and we assume that we will take over a thousand of them a year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," explains dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montreal qualified yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinals played on the total number of goals in the semi-final round of the first division of the USL, thanks to the 3:1 (4:3 goal score after both games) over the Sounders of Seattle.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who managed to deal with Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two games of the quarter-final, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in the Turkwin in the suburbs of Seattle.
Impact will compete in the semifinals with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnonsota, the Thunder equalized a 3:1 deficit in a home game and finally won 4:3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless advanced to the semi-final round with a total number of goals 5:4.
Impact is expected to clash with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will only be confirmed today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekanec and Andrej Kosticin last night at the Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev received one pass in this fourth victory of the three-color of six preseasons.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"In the first third he tried to do too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause.”
Charest relies north
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party Congress (Parti libéral), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-elections.
"To displace the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the end of the Liberal Party Québek Congress in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his backs in a pictorial grinder.
On three giant canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, similar to the election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out triggering early elections in the autumn, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The North Plan forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes an agreement with France on the workforce, a convention between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has recently mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of presentation before.
However, the Prime Minister confined himself to explain why the North represents a "gender with huge potential," but he did not give the deadline, the amount of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: especially hydroelectric power plants, forest, but above all, the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
North, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice the size of France is in our country", "is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, he's in us," he stressed, as if to point out that he's invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the Prime Minister highlighted: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec Engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he paused the theatrically to look at the huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of Québek's territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister clarified during a press conference.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is one border line on which there has long been no convention, and if a suitable opportunity arises, in the name of the government, I will once again take this position," he said.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, speaking of the north-west transition, which will be opened year-round as a result of the melting of the glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that the seizure of territory is becoming a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the native nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pequis MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The activities were launched by the Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) is an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but the moment when "a common vision will be set out."
Moreover, the development of the North should take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as smoothly following the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the still-disguised themes of the weekend, which on Friday was launched with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s accession to the leadership of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rechristen Beauharnois's headquarters on the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, founded by Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who conducted the Calm Revolution and nationalization of hydroelectric power, to the Bourass that created James's Bay, our party was able to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At a press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, the premiere between 1957 and 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric power plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying that between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his membership base, causing considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would not be an election in 2008, and undoubtedly in 2009, he did not rule out the possibility of calling elections in the autumn of this year, which is allowed by law.
However, he stressed that his program is packed, especially the federal council mission in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the Liberal Chief with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially some "efforts to amend the Constitution", which passed very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Party Quebec) is demanding in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes Québec to appoint a portion of the members of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting who would have veto power in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the Plan North was skeptical in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) leader Pauline Marois has once again pulled out North Quebec's Development Policy, which Landry's government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the government of the Liberals came to power in 2003, the fulfilling of this policy was renounced.
If she were to stick to it, "we would have gone on today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are going today) by François Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theater," explained Sébastien Proulx, a leader representing Mario Dumonta, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "Justice" (O irony) in Harper's cabinet, who in the summer of last year took the liberty of telling Louis Arbour that he was "shame" for Canada.
In this way, to reproach the woman who fought an unceasing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the prime minister’s surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us, which is the only one of all participating Western countries not to transport back to the homeland of its national, closed in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
The government, which does not take into account that by the time the actions he was to be reproached, Omar Khadr was a young adolescent.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the guilt of the defendant.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Association of Canadian Attorneys advocate the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can expect a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it doesn’t matter much to the fact that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, and it was undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torment.
We are unaware of it, but we are just witnessing a creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” the words that Harper is wielding so much and which sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, to imprison him according to the arbitrariness of the head of the minority government so far (as will be after 14. October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims Virst, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discos from Barrick Gold
In a September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garvera, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a prosecution of three authors and a poor small publishing house for libel in order to spark "transparent public debate" and demand six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for libation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, Garver is completely decaying this crucial distinction.
Or is Barrick Gold the best way to have a public debate to break anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the process, the authors and publisher of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced battle with an army of attorneys supported by almost bottomless pockets of mining company.
After all, the tactics in these unbalanced struggles often lie in the ruins of the defendants in order to enforce conciliation proceedings, which will clog the mouth of the opposing party and, moreover, scare anyone who dares to devote himself to this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the whole thing to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, Canada is a debate under normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, and not in battalion blows.
Therefore, mine companies were only enough to open up their books, their documentation and to establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have confidence in public opinion, and smach musing petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the vice president's world refers only to boldly paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow-minded conception of this concept.
In a democracy, even the nadipers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports authors and publishers Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be blocked (as in its prosecution of the "public debate" by the way, Barrick has just given official calls to the authors of Noir Canada to officially notify them that they should stop using this term...).
Aside from Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution of the initiated Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom of inquiry and the search for truth that is essential for every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations that represent the very basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without exposing ourselves to repeated prosecutions, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have created it if it had followed the scientific standards used by Noir Canada.
He has the right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong can manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's exaggerated lawsuit shows that despite what it claims, it doesn't have the slightest appetite to have a transparent debate.
For the university world, this is a loss, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit such a type of unjustified prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operations - Democrats and Republicans Understand Each other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, ended yesterday to reach an agreement on the biggest bait economic plan since the 1930s' Great Crisis.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to slow down the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to pay the deposits of public money, new measures to capture the number of houses confiscated due to non-payment, as well as the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to the executives of bailed companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress and have come to an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a statement from the Bush administration.
"Everything was done to make the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
“This is a crucial point: if we don’t, the trauma, the chaos and disruption of the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republicd Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have started at the maximum speed for fear of the effect of another failure on the mood of investors.
The set time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
The two candidates for the US president were invited to the negotiations later, and both expressed their opinion more on the agreement, but did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added an agreement on some measures, especially the one to allow owners to maintain their residence and measures on the wages of senior state-salvities seniors.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing more to congratulate themselves.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was asked by another station, whether he will vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The gross traits I've read [supplier] are concerned that this is something we're all going to have to spend and with which to move forward.
Choring inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the 700-billion-dollar plan is to buy out questionable claims and risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then passed to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and in the dissolution of banks and financial institutions.
The fall in last week's first draft deal is due to Republican MPs.
Ever since Democrats have agreed to the fact that some of the "toxic" assets of companies with difficulties will only be guaranteed by the government, but will not buy them, there is a belief that the hopeless situation is over.
In an effort to approximat the contradictory views in Congress, a measure was attached to the fact that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it will have to take losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan envisages a first-largest €250 billion deposit, to which it will be possible to add an additional $100 billion if the president sees it necessary.
A $350 billion deposit is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington will acquire stakes in rescued companies, which will pay dividends in the event of profit and which will be able to sell again when it is all over.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure procedures of the real estate associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of remuneration and compensation paid to executives of the affected firms.
The masterminds of the plan would like to submit it to the vote in the House of Representatives already today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, voices were further up against the project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It is quite obvious that Washington can't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Financial Commission, said in a statement.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Earning on taxpayers is not a solution.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed the "committees of skeptics," presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed economics professors, among them three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and examine carefully which path to take," he said.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a world crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of a meltover since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) as a result of the risky credit for the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people, one of Europe's top 20 banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we earn the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And it is the savers and households who appreciate it in today’s uncertain times.”
On the other side of the English Channel, the British government seems to have begun nationalizing another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was supposed to take over all existing loans to Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the UK government has had to nationalize since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his trump card, according to others a weakness.
Did this American actor get out with a charming smile from daffynism?
Yes and no.
The slenderness, sensitivity, and the unceasing talent that possessed him also distanced him from the power category that begets real stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at the age of 83 at the age of his banquet in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who was similar to and long as his rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without an exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in it, all this country in love with a self-made man, a fighter at the Pacific War, wounded in a battle who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph at the theatre, on television and soon in the film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a racing driver who placed second at the 24-hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and a sexual symbol at the same time, despite the fact that since 1958 he has formed a model pair with actress Joanne Woodward.
With it, the downsides of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star are also leaving, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will forever remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused the film lovers to be drunk, while his great roles rival each other on the black screen of memories.
After him, he has been defining for more than half a century of the ever-changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a hot roof, Tennessee Williams' 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From the less distant past (1990) we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by marriage, who did not meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls went down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, abused, violent, memorable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me, Robert Wis, a role designed for James Dean, taken after his death, which in 1956 put Newman into true acquaintance.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful billiards player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), played by Martin Scorsese, the same character in The Color of Money, which will bring him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering in ages, that was him.
And he again.
In his professional career, different epochs compete with each other.
The young people know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He then concluded his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in the Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the business for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its gliders, flamboyance and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded him, not without humor, "a lively challenge of underplaying", judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, he played the first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and losers, whose decay and rebellions reflected in his perfect traits.
As director Newman, he revealed the little-known aspects of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward, played a leading role, gives a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He gave his son Scott, whom he lost for an overdose, in 1984, the Harry and Son film, a work full of shame and sadness.
In the inrrential honors Newcastle yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-combatant Robert Redford (playing together in The Sting and the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) grievously stated: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Magnificence, love of life, such are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, the great civil rights activist, ecology, independent film, the opponent of the decline of Hollywood is also leaving.
His portrait was used to seeing vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods on bottles of wine vinegar, but it may have been quite tasteless to us, although it was initially a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for a difficult childhood.
So, rather than be lulled by glory, Newman engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor that I could be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to be able to follow the career of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & spol. invoice factory?
Before long, 8. October, the trial will begin in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlaga and his associates.
The politician and his associates, in addition to other crimes, including forgery of deeds, are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematically criminal organization, as a result of which extremely significant damages were caused.
According to the prosecutor, they used the money raised in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the fulfillment of the tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - the total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The manner also reported by the investigating authority was that the money obtained in the tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration, and the commitments made by the associations never fulfilled.
According to the indictment, a large proportion of invoices were false.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kisunhalasi.
The names of which companies should make invoices were decided, among other things, on a tour along the northern bank of the Balaton, to which István Ladas János Zuschlag sent István Ladas.
According to his testimony, the former was supposed to look for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he asked for accounts for his consumption, according to whose model the invoices submitted in the framework of public tenders announced, inter alia, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively the Self-Government of the Capital City, were then produced.
Invoices were mostly issued by István Lados with his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study journey" Lados looked for a pub.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlage and his associates in 2003, this hospitality catering facility for the 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
However, so many people would not fit into this facility at once, according to the company’s manager.
Likewise, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the formal and content errors was swarmed by the foundation called Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaya had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, fillers of forms with a rich imagination overdid it even when they introduced on the documents a company dedicated to the hospitality industry - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor's office, documents sounding in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even figure.
The company manager Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, besides the formalities, the fact that according to the invoice they accommodated a hundred people, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, food has also been mentioned on the invoice, and their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The outrageous invoice makers were not convinced that the Budapest travel agency is organizing only foreign trips, and on an invoice with cash payments, which also did not coincide with the company’s invoicing practice, they said foolishly as a travel mediation service around Hungary.
Moreover, as it emerged during the course of the investigation, they also said VAT in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union has been exempted from VAT.
The VAT level did not agree, among other things, the VAT level on four documents issued by Jobb Jövőért by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. The activities of the company are not covered by the 25 percent, but 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written by hand.
In addition, the "publishers" spoiled the invoice by saying, for example, at one company, how it came out thanks to the investigation of the Public Prosecutor's Office, as the activity carried out by the road transport of goods, which the company based originally on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that invoices are issued by the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the XXI associations. The safety of the Kulturáris Egyesület and Biztos Pont fake, was also revealed because of formal deviations - the non-corresponding format of the invoice and the wrong stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives have denied issuing invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyházy was at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating, in liquidation, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
Invoices were kept consciously
The second group of invoients are those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifyú Szocialisták.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab s. r. o. was prompted by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account.
Biogate s. r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and Atlasz and Vörösfenyőyőyőyőr to the associations Atlas and Vörösfenyő invoices worth about five million forints, for which there was no actual economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later canceled, which, however, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of billing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorized representative of the Ukrainian executive of Delta Trió s. r. o., engaged in the trading of fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, on which the company is not available.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints in October, November and December 2005.
According to the data obtained by the investigation, the Kishunhalaská company Cash Investment s. r. o., which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005, bought these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was also to hand over documents related to the company in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért on behalf of the company and accepted their consideration.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian bricklayers were founded by the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, neither of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies benefited him, because at the request of the co-accused attorney Zsolt Sznet, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices to the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations connected to Zuschlag on behalf of the companies.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office decided that Kubatov came to 10 percent of the amounts listed on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the tender for the association Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországhet, the Jointly Beneficis Association (TMA), the Socialist Party’s public benefit organization, submitted proposals for the public tender.
They received 500 thousand forints, but did not spend the amounts on the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order not to show this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a house search at the office of Árpáda Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, part of the defendants will probably describe the course of invoice production, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant János Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he would interpret everything in a comprehensive manner, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the socialists made a deal with him, and Zusi will take it upon himself.
After all, he may have been offended for the time being, because his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely placing him under house arrest, have remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have done much greater damage, which have not yet paid, are free to walk through or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology trumping: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to researchers from the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in an eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research, using an experimental auction, attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers planted, the other group participated in a live-action auction, while the active areas of the brain of experimental subjects were investigated using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI method).
In both games, participants could win money, but during the game for the auction, an important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole unit found under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively during the loss.
In addition to many other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-remutation" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, it is therefore possible to explain the unscrupulous price by trying to avoid a sharp reaction of striata.
To support their theory, members of the research team from the ranks of economists carried out a financial cross-cutting survey.
Under different conditions, three groups appealed against one partner.
The control group was simply communicated what the real value of the product was, and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the next group were promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they will get $15 as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, all in all that was emphasized by one win and the other a loss.
However, members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to go higher than the case in the control and "wine" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be deduced from any existing economic theory.
Until now, they have explained phenomena observable during auctions with the joy of victory and avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped us solve the contradiction between these two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York’s Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to consult a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, the symptomatic is inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causative agents of the disease and their caused diseases differ from each other.
The hepatitis viruses, depending on the causative diseases, are spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E by the digestive system (for example, infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
In any case, travellers should protect themselves with vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against the type C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, the urge to vomit.
Then jaundice forms on the skin and eye whites, lighter stools and darken the urine. Treatment can take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from a more serious kind of disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected person is medically treated.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of those infected do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys the liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms occur in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, the implementation of regular descripture.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the expected global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can prove already routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his/her general practitioner if he notices any symptom of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing contagiousness and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is a world day of hepatitis, which was organized by organizations representing the sick for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its origin and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Benelux governments national part of Fortis Bank
Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to run into trouble due to the spreading effect of the crisis of the US mortgage market, by partial nationalization: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institutions, which also have a capital participation in Hungary, with a sum of €1.2 billion.
This weekend was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to have entered a major crisis in the crisis of international financial markets, which have been circulating in waves for more than a year, and decisions made in this matter could be judged as precedent precedent.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy nearly half (49 percent) of the bank's property.
The bank will sell with absolute certainty some of its capital interests, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Shares of Fortis Bank began to decline sharply last week, with serious signs of a crisis already appearing in the institution in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that with its 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The firm's securities fell by just 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capital of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's leaders, this is unrealistic.
After all, the management of the company blames the fall in Fortis shares in the overseas market related to the adoption of the $700 billion plan of the US package.
On Monday, the stock rose slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO Filip Dierckx was appointed to head the bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet signed up with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients yet, and the branches have not been taken by an attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also purchased several leasing companies.
Who believes in God, doesn't hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that may have relieved death of Catholic martyrs.
Researchers at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, researching how a person’s belief in the god’s perception of pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of aesets to electric shocks, while everyone observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out a large part of the pain.
Thanks to the technique in detail examining the human brain, it has also been shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first of a series of researches involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university in addition to academics.
Exactly the test proceeded by attaching a sparkling tool to the left hand of the test subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings intently: the Sassoferrat Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with the square of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain state of piety among the faithful, while da Vinci chose the image because it does not differ much from the first and gives them a calming impression.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while separately watching the image with religious or general themes.
The Catholics stated that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Virgin Mary, as if they were "take care" and "reassured themselves, they fulfilled their peace."
While watching the painting with religious themes, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved through any highly impressive image even in aetenance, just need to find the right photo.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases will also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they showed them a madon from Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you share of yourself
On his 10th birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky over their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what expert examinations are for and what they are interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s bosses, this is still not enough.
However, as for the skeptics, making a parallel with the Orwellian dark vision, it is not clear to them the very essence of the website 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to stick to their original intention, which was, “Guest all the information in the world!”
According to Google’s interviewed official, the company, even after ten years of world-class work, is only at the beginning of being able to work with all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what work would be useful for me?" - however, such seemingly simple questions will not be able to answer until they know enough information about users.
Not all Internet users know that during the Internet search, the search words and what IP address was searched from are accurately captured and what pages the interested parties moved to after searching.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, for example, users can store their surfing history, take a look back on what they were looking for and what they clicked on, so that in the long run the way it is generated by finds adapted to them - the same logic will also be created by the Recommendations service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously listed and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at it, what do I do? - users who are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company seems threatening, the counter-reaction does not cause guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personality rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example of recent times was probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community site, established through it.
However, Internet users who are worried about personality rights may still be relieved in May when the company, hand in hand with the EFF Electronic Rights Organization, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully won nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms it obtained, citing the reinforcements before the years of the adopted Child Protection Act, but still failed to get lists of the searched items of individual users, respectively, the full lists of websites and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is whipped by those who are worried about providing their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be imminent in harm by starting to use Google services, and opposing it with a revolt belonging to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around them enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees it as a new generation of big companies, "a corporation that is now on," unlike its rival Microsoft, considered a conqueror of the world because of Windows, both fighting for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to have an identification code and does not want money from them for its applications; an open, free, and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as much more accessible, juvenile, "cooler" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that the geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which brought with it just one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than cooperation, about the fact that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the channels of communication available to us, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which they can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music listening by it, all this can then be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides, they can write a blog on which to automatically discover its latest photogallery, which is stored on Flick.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases from which she clears: in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of mutual friends, she easily finds out with whom her lavish boyfriend spent the evening, or the company can throw out its worker only because on his blog he describes his sincere opinion about the leadership: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has completely re-evaluated today.
The one who lives online life consists of what he shows, so we could define the basic thesis hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid the Googloist monopoly has the option (starting with Sccoogle, which uses the Google search system, but deliberately does not leave traces).
For example, a considerable number of people do not intentionally register on community sites so that they cannot be found. Google's online application from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which of us do not compile the highest quality profile.
Public opinion does not secretly expect when Google will show teeth.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($144 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens the investment of advertising agencies, and services introduced with an ever-accelerating rate make life not only for Microsoft, but also numerous other software designers.
In addition, critical observers also find counterpoints causing a disturbing impression: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of employees after double the fee for the company nursery, the daily daily catering of employees was too expensive, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google still bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, will filter out any finding that is opposed to the good
One of the internal rules of the company is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the coming months and years can cheat the world in new places: while some believe that a Google project focused on scanning and archiving books and magazines takes on such dimensions that the company will soon have to do with the U.S. Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete health profile.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting material for future generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow's famous novella "Scroople" describes a future with Orwellian reminiscences, in which one can be approached deterioratingly only with the help of Google data.
Two-dollar teenage people helped remove the two-time killer from Ózd
Two juveniles were interviewed by police in a case of double murder in Ózd, according to reasonable suspicions, they helped with the removal of traces of this crime, a spokesman for the Borsod High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activities from which they were suspect and are currently charged with abetication of abetting a crime.
Both juveniles, according to MTI, two girls, are prosecuted at large.
Aiding to the crime is punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ózdo, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into provisional detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for self-intervention.
During the investigation, it emerged that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man a larger amount.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a store in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed the man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Makes Offer to Buy a Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a hundred percent package of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Solowewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs have previously expelled the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is due to the fact that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 reports, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to the bidder for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted the offer so far.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the Financial Crisis from the Perspective of European Newspaper
In their comments on Tuesday, the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers are already reminiscent of "September 11" in their comments on the deepening international financial crisis.
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the US president, the Roman La Repubblica is allegations. The president was not even able to line his own party in support of that hastily-covered bill, which aims to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second 9/11.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
In the opinion of the daily El Mundo, he brought the world economy to the brink of collapse of the political leadership there.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is steadily rising, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to resolve the crisis after the vote in Congress.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline for staggering financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if other banks collapse like the dice of dominatrix, then neither the funds nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move over their national egoism and to unite control of fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, postponing financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, recalling the Vienna Der Standard, according to which fears that, like Americans, in order to solve the crisis, European taxpayers will have to dig deep into the pocket of even European taxpayers, will have to dig deep into the pocket.
The European Union has not yet seriously dealt with the crisis, which is rolling in the old continent as a tsunami.
"Rescuers" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they fixed firmly in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money in order to avoid even more damage.
Smart car imitates a bumbledoer flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example, in bees.
The initial strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC trade fair, was inspired by Nissan bumblebees engineers. It was about building a new generation of collision-refighting systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has engineered a biomimetic robotic robotic control system, a robotic minicar that is equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which actually closely resembles our safety protective cover," Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand's brand for technology PR and research and development, explained at the Kazuhiro Doi exhibition.
An important role is played by folded eyes, allowing bees to see in all directions in a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the folded eye, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters in the BR23C field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into an operation aimed at preventing collisions.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotized car starts to imitate the movements of the bee and turns the wheels in the range needed to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this switching manoeuvre takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, a robotic car would not have been able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshijuki Ando, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and internal layer of the safety protective packaging, inside which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered by bees when avoiding, only the possibility of revolving movement, acceleration and deceleration was applied in the case of a robotic car.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, the important instinctive, intelligent reaction, is not the ability to process, much less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store them and respond using intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so it is constantly using only a memory the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology used to avoid immediately, which Nissan estimates could get into mass-produced cars within ten years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding the path of the lying obstacles, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
A damned expensive child already has a name
The $700 billion baying baying out the €700 billion-based law, which is to be divided into several instalments and aims to buy out poor-quality loans from banks, is already in writing.
In the first round, half the amount will be used.
After further talks, which ended on Saturday after midnight US Eastern Time, congressional officials reached an agreement in a several-day-long debate over a $700 billion worth of a bailout, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the House of Representatives' Democratic House Speaker, said in which only the agreement remains to be drawn up.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the outcome of the compromise: "The program will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. Monday at two o'CL o'm in the Middle European Time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
The draft rule of law, which is called 2008, which is to be established in the name of the 2008 Act on Emergency Economic Stabilization, will be voted on Monday by the House of Representatives, then the Senate will be the turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then news of the deal was also welcomed at the White House.
“We are satisfied with the progress made last night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
Moreover, the program differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was supposed to be a matter of taking away a total of $700 billion at once to buy off low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of $700 billion in the first round, in such a way that $250 billion will be used immediately after the deal will be decided by Congress on Monday as expected, and the Treasury Department will buy mortgage-backed securities that are rated as poor-quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president's decision.
The program will be controlled by a special body, of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
The use of the second half of $700 billion will depend on the Congressional's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy low-quality loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, or other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase can also take place directly within the framework of the auctions, the competent representatives of the ministry said.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for funds representing a reason for concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary funds to meet the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system, up to $700 billion, whether it’s a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the large financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The heads of the banks that have run into trouble and are waiting for the help of the state, on the contrary, can count on the government to reduce their severancesion - which in overseas slang is simply called "gold parachute".
Their payments will only be limited in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the Ministry buys under the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight into retirement.
In the case of direct redemption of low-quality loans, the government will aggressively intervene in the interest that the money for the management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing contracts for gold parachutes will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which is to be a further incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history where the statutory restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs will be in force," said Barrney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state will have the right to acquire a share in the banks participating in the program, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the saved bank is on its feet, they can even make money on this transaction.
The plan for the proposal states that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal setting how taxpayers can be returned to the expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were also voices expressing in relation to the plan of doubt.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, because this will not protect taxpayer dollars,” said Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman at California.
His Democratic colleague, Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that the provisions were asked to be taken precisely by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest price increase took place in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to the month-on-month price increase in the sector of bag and saddlery products sector by 4.6 percent, respectively, footwear production by 2.5 percent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).

In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured the increase in prices in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the sector of production and distribution of electricity, gas and water, which has a large weight in the domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continued effect of an officially established increase in gas prices from 1. July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the sector of metalworking production, it was possible to observe 13.2 percent, in the area of production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, then an 11 percent increase in prices.
Prices have been reduced in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 percent) and the production of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.3 percent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.

Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is a great deal of hope that the U.S.-Khyk Visa Waiver Agreement will come into force around January 12, the Foreign Secretary of State spoke about this in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "now almost everything depends only on whether an electronic system of permitting paths or controls is built over the sea in time."
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not be allowed to enter, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
As of today, the Hungarian Foreign Minister continues to talks in Washington.
She will meet with Secretary of State Condoleeezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with the star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary and will conduct talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday, confident of their support for the government's $700 billion bailout package, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few days of marathon of congressional negotiations and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement on a bank rescue package was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to rebuild the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are described as a more appropriate candidate to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls at the same time as the economic issues came to the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and McCain's lead, which he secured after the Republican convention by nominating Sarah Palin for the vice president's post, has dissuded after the Republican convention.
Obama expressed hope at a Detroit election rally on Sunday that a €700 billion package bill would be swiftly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We have to act immediately, responsibly (...) your places, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the entire economy is in danger," he said in front of the 35th thousand crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC: "It's going to be a little bit of a cause (...) but doing nothing is just not possible a way."
As the Republican senator said, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the finance minister and limiting severance pay for the leaders he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a more important role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Monday.
Overview of the printing of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more confident - thus analyzing the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderites are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its fathers" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began much before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The alternation of the period is a problem for all Christian democracy, and thus Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could be expected for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still in the so-missed period of Stoiber.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at pace. Secularization, however, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not be without consequences for the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it became more confident, more critical, more governor.
It is also clear that in recent weeks the CSU has mostly moved away from the classical civic strata; people in the liberal profession, sole traders, individuals with graduation and university education.
This has already stung under 40 percent of the CSU support.

The conservative Vienna Diary in its article titled "Who, with whom? The party leaders are reticent on the issue of the coalition" dedicates the confused internal political situation arising as a result of the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to deal with the ÖVP.
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ meddling in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to agree on a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in a debate held on public television, the party leaders did not get much look into their cards.
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both sides is certainly possible - in some Länder and in the social partnership it exists.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overruler for every fall.
Repetition of this is out of the question.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red bids.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is so far completely open in the party, these questions must be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ Chairman Jörg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-and-black coalition, we are ready to take on government account," Haider said in a statement.
Járóková: It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
The European Equality Summit, hosted by France, the current presiding state of the European Union, began in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of professional deliberations in her message addressed to the plenary, turned her attention to segregation in education, as she is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
They sat down among the invited leaders of governments, the European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civic associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková, pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs during the recruitment of labour, Romani people are forced out of the European labour market primarily due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, due to poor quality of primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in the exercise of other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children may strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the awareness of these connections in the widest circles - among Romani and non-Romani children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties, they contribute to the national budget.
"Roma is the right to their citizenship of the European Union the need to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their not very high-quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MP, the European Union's cohesion with an emphasis on the objective and negotiations is needed to immediately accelerate the processes of school de-gelegation, to which correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is primarily important.
"It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to provide Romani children with options given by the democratic space in order to participate as full-right citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková said.
Everyone is marked by the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" the objective of the European Equality Summit, organised annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination set at the level of the whole of Europe and individual Member States.
Fox in the chicken coop
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on data on drug purchase data, often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollably.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of drug prescribing data in any event to the consent of the person concerned.
He must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to the fox," the Washington Post quoted Richard Dick, the author of a program designed to monitor the prescription of drugs, as saying.
Insurance companies are premiums and amounts paid in the case of claims depending on the health of the applicants, and if the risk is evaluated as too large, they will not even conclude the insurance with it.
Previously, they sent the person concerned for medical examinations and only concluded the contract when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer from pharmacies easily finds out what drugs the person has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself deduces, what the disease suffers and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys a large number of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to having virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fat, which immediately puts it in the category at a higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some at the same time determine the risk coefficient, so there is almost no work to the insurance company, except for paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that some drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraine or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
From the point of view of commercial insurers, they represent a significant factor in risk-enhancing, while the formerly not.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been created to request the patient's permission before providing the necessary information from pharmacies.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not punished them for their negligence.
Some companies have recently processed the results of laboratory examinations that combine data on drugs used, thanks to which they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, while checking their use will become increasingly complicated.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give the authorities the power to control even businesses specializing in the provision of data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: that is why he developed his program in such a way that the data referral is tied to the express consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the permission in question can hardly deny, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the chickens are somewhat reliant on the fox's goodwill.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the outgoing duo Huber-Bockstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the disgraceful electoral debacle, the head has not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their place, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the extraordinary congress of the party on the last weekend of October.
In any case, members of the highly criticized duo have said that they will not cling to their posts with all their might.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber standing at the peak of her career - she gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but her strength was only 43.4 percent.
The CSU was the "self-governor" in Bavaria producing 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years.
While conservatives in the southern state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, are still of high positions, but in the future they will be forced to join the coalition in any event.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of the narrow intelligence team, which will begin with a probationary negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or rather with the right-wing grouping of the Free Voters, will also be the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli came to the Diet on the candidate list of the Free Voters, whose appearance against Stoiber was used by the duo Huber-Bockstein to carry out the coup, but then they made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, the active role will also fall to Stoiber, who has until now weaved the strings from the background, and the former chairman of the CSU called the most bitter day of his political career on September 28.
On Monday, Huber drew a few sarcastic remarks on the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections for September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, will somehow not get back on her feet.
According to Merkel, who had a hard time hiding her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: to treat the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved the weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko: opposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition MP made it to the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSE), the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10-million-year-old country has been depriving the opposition well for ten years, the opposition, united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's election, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who, on the basis of a change in the constitution in elections, with a questionable course in 2006, the fourth time renews his presidential mandate, this time "allows"
The ODS has also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
Behind the opposition expectation, Belarus was economically increasingly heavily dependent on Russia - which took a loan to mitigate the impact of the ever-causing Russian import of natural gas and contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, which owns gas pipelines passing through the country, wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political system, as the anti-democratic Lukashenko, is not given the basis.
The release had previously pointed out that the OSCE had placed emphasis on positive shifts and not deficiencies - for example, banning candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
Monday's flash report of the OSCE, however, had reservations about the campaign, during which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press, especially to the fact that the opposition could not be present for the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, one can feel an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in smaller confrontations with Moscow, when he continues to refuse to recognize the secessary of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, considers these two territories independent for a month.
"We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Millinekevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it should remain so, even though "it is too frightened to embark on an insignificant parliament of a single member of the opposition."
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, rather he tries to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, distribution is putting obstacles from local authorities, but I still see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elders," Milinkevič said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, is not considered to be the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security 'inducing silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, the head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Rio Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but actions", so that the absence of the opposition is nothing more than a testament to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are leading trade partners, this topic was dominated by, in addition to other, mainly global problems, the agenda of the ninth meeting at the highest level.
Today, the Franco-Indian summit will also be held, at which it will be primarily about cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak into international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to find a common denominator on the issue of supporting the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not further discussed at yesterday’s ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current president of the Union, or European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solan, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or rise to more than a hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods has risen from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were legally aligned, so air transport was also given the green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy has promised that negotiations would be speeded up.
The goal is to balance the balance sheet, while the EU is India's first trading partner, with New Delhi figures among EU partners up to ninth.
The summit also paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, was condemned by both sides in all its forms and called for an urgent call for the UN conference.
They also urged the end of the round of business negotiations from Doha, although both have a large share in its previous failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least twenty percent by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as that at the next year's climate conference, it would be necessary to conclude a global agreement and the production of gas-causing greenhouse effect by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister is now arriving in the French capital, where he is preparing to close a trade in the peaceful use of atomic energy during a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will gain a mandate to build India's nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors out of one hundred and one different countries, who will occupy 171,790 sqm of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorable guest.
Deputy Culture Minister Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inaugural festivities in the Italian pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian resort (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in Room Structures Buchmesse in Hall 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, tendencies and perspectives in terms of the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to total Italian production is still decreasing, especially in relation to literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that the revolving doors were introduced on the arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure will begin to work against scruffy people, against those who sting and then go for coffee during working hours.
The novelty against the lazy was put in place today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunette, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council Maurem Masi.
“Revolving doors – says Brunetta – are a tool for better work, higher performance, more attendance and more services,” the minister clarifies.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will be opened.
This is reformism," Brunetta emphasizes.
We will complete the implementation of all buildings of the Council Presidency by the Chigi Palace.
For Masi, "the choice of a rotating door is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the employees, the secretary-general assures: "This was a common approach with the workers and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'mi in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will eventually announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, 60 thousand more people a year at work."
And it will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
“Her payout dynamics – the minister explains – has doubled in the last 8-10 years with regard to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public workers have come together to reject the standards of the Brunette decree in accordance with the application supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister for Public Administration today presents figures on lower absence from work due to illness – writes the consumer protection association – the nation of ‘dunk lazy’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and corrective employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.”
Tara will be protested primarily against the exclusion of sick leave allowances, which depends on the activity; the extension of the period in which the patient can be checked at what time range the inspection visits will be carried out and against the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Occupational accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents at work happen in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of accidents at work.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons for death and causes almost twice the deaths compared to murder.
In order to regain the attention of institutions, social and information about this dramatic issue, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of Victims of Work on the second Sunday of October in all Italian regions.
“The disturbing data spread by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm how important the issue of occupational safety is,” confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Mug and Disabledness for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint efforts to safety in jobs, to protect wounded workers, to help the families of the victims and the complicity of public opinion."
“Naturally, an outraged ‘enough’ has been raised, sincerely shared in the face of tragedies that cause a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "undoubtedly there is also a resource problem here: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular importance is taken by the numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education in order for young people facing the world of work to gain clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its disturbing social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The president of the chamber, Gianfranco Fini, on his part, stressed "how the phenomenon of death due to an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social state, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make convincing efforts to the necessary end of this state."
“As far as the data on accidents at work seems to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of an accident at work is alarming,” said Anil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want this 'reduction effort' to lead to less attention, because just the moment the attention stops, a tragedy breaks out.
“We believe that there is still too little to stop the problem of accidents in general, and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion - emphasized Mercandelli - to increase inspections and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from school age."
“There is still a need for further efforts – in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But it is mainly necessary to make more sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli ultimately declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the levels of law to the compensation assumed for labor victims and the "removing of supportive care" to which the system has been getting in recent years."
“The goal, therefore, is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker – because the fate of those who hurts must not depend on spontaneity or gift from time to time by the legislator.”
Players of Mp3 charged, expose hearing to risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a report published today by the European Commission, which in one official report, enlarged in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Science, which has recently arisen and identified (Csreri) Eu.
“It follows from this scientific opinion – we read in notes – that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a day per week, and keep the device at high volume, risk a permanent loss of auditory ability.”
“I’m worried that such a large number of young people who use often portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” admits Meglan Kuneva.
“Scientific findings – the manager continues – a clear risk arises and needs to be responded quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and disclose this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them entirely effective and keep up with new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this problem due to the high use of portable music instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
“Scientists – concluded by the executive officer of the Eu – confirm that they need to worry and now the European Commission will examine together with other members and parties that have raised the problem, what measures could be implemented and thus better protected children and young people from being exposed to noise, which is the source of portable music devices and similar devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices per 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage, which may be due to excessive exposures of similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions to reduce the level and duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Eu Scientific Committee states that users of portable music devices, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the currently valid limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for an extended period of time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices, and their amount can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people at the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno leaves the Commission for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have the sums in June.
Such is the calendar given by the Campidoglio workers to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new mandible behind the Caracalla Spa.
At six months, President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunt and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and its councillor Gianni Alemann.
“The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included – it wants to emphasize Alemanno – It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators, which remain the GIunta Municipal Council.
It is not about replacing functions, but only an effort to have some place to process a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact time date.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome.
Alemanno said to the person who accuses the Commission of useless, given that its views will not be binding, Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as the proposals of the Attali Commission, and I am therefore also sure of in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often politics breaks out on everyday problems and the urgency that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary enterprise nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not be the state or the euro, and will serve to persuade and involve the best intelligence that the capital city has."
For Alemann, essentially, "it is necessary to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, nor definitively or immobile, in order to allow our city to allow our city to an authentic rise at the level it badly needs, and to think with a unified spirit about its future."
The future, which is clarified by the mayor of Rome "it will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status, but "also will include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president. It's already known why
One well-known US president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as even today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.”
Attacks against Obama are rising just as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has audacity: he thinks he will get into the highest post of nation, which had two governors and five black senators!”
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they're attacks clearly of racial origin and don't answer the question of the electorate: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; everyone says Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the bowels of the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the electoral cabinet, we know well to whom an American patriot will vote.
One side of the American mentality, which remained hidden until the last moment, will be the forces.
Say what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves, who to tick off, Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? Eighty-nine percent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent it home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans were forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the US was also felt by journalists: there is a period of inquiry in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the newspaper.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and assumptions regarding the future.
Now almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents have not openly said they had less concerns about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis-destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made to the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspaper together, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists surveyed, this is a problem that needs to be solved, whether we do not want traditional journalism, as the general public understands, fundamentally change.
A clear but complex pessimism permeates an American journalist.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that journalism is taking the wrong path on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
Largers are making their way to the Internet, which many look at as the "killer" of the printed matter.
The "economy pressure" that journalists point out increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists admitted to resorting to technology in the hope that they would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run the newsroom -- that is, leaders -- and reporters who work for them.
56% of the leaders at the national level are certain that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something for someone to do with "the certainty of work."
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at the national level of 47%.
As for journalists, they range to 30%.
As for "certain work" related to personnel (our editors, ndr) in America is still a daily occurrence.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a huge nation as the Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and internet, employers often offer what they want, and so the question is taken or left.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries, and the editor can earn even ten thousand dollars a month outside of paying pensions and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confessions, often get sick over the course of a year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RETINES IN GROTTAFERRAT
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to dismiss the filing of a real estate businessman, Daniel Copola, who asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppol is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-offer of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he received his release from house arrest last week, which was converted into forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked the real estate businessman to change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this transfer (aga12. which he expressed himself) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon manifested itself a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against a $700 billion rescue plan to present the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than saving economics.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis will break down the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, milder, accommodating to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, hostile to those from Washington’s” and the world of finance, strong especially in the middle and south states.
A soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I talked about at the beginning.
But this quoted thing is just an example of change, the big changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but all over the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in the USas and in Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an acelerator of phenomena that have long been in incumbation, which are being strengthened in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is reactualization, an extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis of bank-financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are primarily included.
This has created a political problem at the same time for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis seems to be economically world-wide, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be substantially out of the game or that it has nothing much to add: the obvious proof was given by the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot decide on one common political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, the recovery of the market, new rules and, most importantly, the distribution of funds: at the moment when we get into distress, only states have economic resources, a number of financial resources, so that they are able to try to put everything in order.
And they also own the necessary means and the right to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
Moreover, this new emphaphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, after all, in complete harmony with an ever-greater importance, which attempts to attribute to the last economic advances towards one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of seta, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that worldwide finances were already destined to rule the world, all of a sudden we realized that our future, on the contrary, would have to struggle more and more with such low-material things as water, grain, oil.
All the things that would have been said can be transported from one place to the earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to the bounded space, the territory.
So, who becomes their ruler, he certainly has many more cards up his sleeve than he is not and who is unlucky, that he lives in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second novelty, but it's a turning point.
Whoever speaks about territory, the state, the government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objectively need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could take up the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditability towards existing leaders, especially economic ones, which proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discrediting, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems that the convictions are increasingly expanding in the broad masses of the population than to be the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already overcome its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply nourishes one branch from the underground, but the strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order manifests itself in the unexpected electoral "resistances" or in the unexpected changes in collective sentiment in the last and last time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bascan to the fall of Labour in the United Kingdom, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, they are having more and more problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is formed in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially too much.
Before this, it would be exaggerated to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion."
But we certainly can't say it means having your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walking on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
The researchers managed to keep the hundred-kilogram body glued on the vertical wall using a sticker of just 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science publishes discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, in the Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that uses a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf pipes.
“The basis of glue can be imagined as a series of pipes laid as an arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs, which allow the animal to ensure perfect adherence.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new glue is ten times more powerful than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "to" is simply peels off the wall» explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dayton.
WALN'T YOU WALKABLE? -"This material could be useful as a makeshift glue» will be supplied by Liming Dai.
To walk on the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers are thinking of a far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could apply to aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
FORE R&A – Also the University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to researching a new glue.
In one paper on the American Chemical Society, California researchers introduced microfibre-formed glue as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving around the surface to keep perfect fitting.
Medices: Never with Juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed especially in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes intensification or a decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, a professor at Western Ontario University in London, to highlight the risks of juices both ready-made and fresh in combination with the use of certain drugs, the current 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia raises a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, to annul their beneficial effects.
Grape juice has already been charged for raising the effects of some antiarramine drugs, antibiotics, antibiotics, antibiotics, anti-nistamine and neurological drugs.
DECISOR TO RISK – This was announced by the Italian Medical Agency itself in the newsletter two years ago and roused doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from the mixture and to be careful what they drink if they take medication, such as Diazepam or Metalon.
NOT JUST GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of effects of grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call from Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University in Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange the information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaves of the drugs you get, and if you come across something unclear, do not worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification» emphasized the expert for Ansa.
Nobel in economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in terms of the foreign, economic and political actions of the Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, on the days when Enron was failing, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of the consequences on the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that has caused many controversies and which has been reproached for years, which, however, turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at the speed at which the collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is an "economist of great importance", but also a popularizer who has a "very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush Liberalist Administration".
Open Office, here we have the third release of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that is moving towards more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteer workers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will add more, far more substantial, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the last standard version of ISO.
Emphasis is also placed on working with the Office 2007 package Open Office is able to open a document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transmission by electronic means, or the ability to transfer the PDF folder to the graphical model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still, from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excell it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to comments to make it clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some businesses are also working to transfer some Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and should translate the final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirror from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the package is also available for Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of freeness can be a draw to expand in households, the Open Office business area is a lot of betting, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultations and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business perspectives.
The Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video typing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that is aimed at replacing Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, ultimately, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this expected number can be surpassed.
Also the results of Kohla are positive, it is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and the winner of the best climber's T-shirt.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe website.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor positive at Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those that have been conducted in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the set two years of disqualification.
The report on the Positivity of Kohl at the Third Generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities about the outcome.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sister and the American Cadel Evans, also won the polka dot shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES ARE SOUGHT, IS ITALIA A RANIST?
Italy, "as an immigrant country, has only transformed itself in the last house into a preferential target of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
Does it turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? Thus, they ask in a long article in the New York Times, which dealt with this article of a debate on the topic of racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines "paradox of the North": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant mindset in the country and the strongest support for the North League."
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
Also, the new Lego required by Lego, which seeks to hamper immigration and facilitates the expulation of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
The tendency, highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism."
Steve Fosset's plane found, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fosset, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada.
The wreckage was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, dispersed the doubts that still remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew in on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff therefore clarified that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) announced that a few hours after the debris was recognized, an investigational team was sent to eventually identify the plane: it is exactly Bellanca 8kcab, missing from September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fosset's personal items were found by one couple near their dwellings in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fosset's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one jacket.
The search for Fosset was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has won a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: two weeks of flying alone.
Three years later, he circled the world on a plane and without landing.
Among his many records is also a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albettle with a co-pilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" jeeps of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a vortex of news into this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing, the unexpected and unconventional and communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next 17. October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for a car brand.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of a car in stereoscopic vision, and with the help of special glasses that will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will leave the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its little things, so that it is then reassembed in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We'll see.
So we already know who the Italian hooligans are
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who is the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the Ultras Italia group, which has been tracking the Nazionaale azzurra for years and has never caused exaggerated problems until now.
She never met the fans of the opponent.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders come from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Triestue Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of the origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening, they removed them so that they would not be recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found true Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc has made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all in the name, that is, easy to control.
And Viminale really checked them all: there was no one with Dassel among those who went to Sofia, no one who would be forbidden to visit stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier violations from the stadium were denied a ticket and a ban on the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that will come from the Bulgarian police, then they will take measures: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which prohibits the visit of not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a single stadium.
To beware.
But now there is a fear of emulsion: this means that more than a hundred and fifty more will be added to those.
“We need to immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who behave in this way,” Viminal said.
So, "properly open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Leči".
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, it is a secret service that takes care of problems in stadiums.
"Chain Leader-leader and tight arm during the mumethane? It's not a crime in Bulgaria..."
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really low-light way), who is the director of the Viminal Osservatoria for a few weeks (acquired a place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felico Ferlizzi).
Mazzilla was formerly the Bursteroom in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate leaders, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I’m not a sociologist – the Osservator’s number one – crimes are attributed to the country they happened.
So far, this group has remained within bounds, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whisking at the Mameli hymn: even this is not a crime, but if you allow, it is rudeness...”
Students by victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The renting market for university students knows no crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, tenant unions, rent a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall overly high prices their families would have to endure – explains the head of the Sunia studio office, Laura Mariani – in this city the great demand from students distorted the market in such a way that it stimulated the price increase process, which has spread even to residents.”
In most cases, rent offers contain several offenses: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, associated sublettes.
For Sunji, an exceptional intervention is needed, which could regulate prices thanks to the revision of taxes.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza region, it is needed for a single bed about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (Pande Nere zone) through the mean value of 800 (La Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, it is necessary 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in single.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros per single room, 450 beds in double bed.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for a single room of Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are needed for a bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the zones of Policlinica, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have greater effects on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common phenomenon is rent for students from outside the European Union, one additional anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want from foreign students, compared to Italian.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, cities are disturbed by historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is like blind, it's like an eyeless face."
The painting offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in the major Italian city centers, as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multisal to the suburbs and the subsequent demise of the monosalts in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of a true cultural crime.
Often disappearing historical places packed with memories," it is as if we lost a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a long way and a lot of emotions», feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that twenty years ago won an Oscar and a grand jury prize in Cannes, and who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness for the way of life, which probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional tip have closed the door, and the highest account was paid primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, by 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torine, by 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna is the first with a loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsibility for their disappearance is the onset of the multiplex, the following three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema multisholders: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, about 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«Italian procedure has evolved unresolutely» claims Paolo Protti, the president of Anecu," is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the insufficient subsidy for the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
The sector would require between €16 million and €18 per year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city, which is concerned about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing the server between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centers and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps in favour of operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to drive into the limited-to-transport zone and have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
«I like this initiative» says Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, it is certain that in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more challenging.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that was forever important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to start the "New Paradiso Cinema", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialt or Quilinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotion I don't have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I turn to the other side».
Connection between politics and mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in Prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the municipality's election according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The charges that the Anti-Mafia Headquarters in Calabria are hovering against Mayor and Vice-Mayor Gioi Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione, Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarn Carlo Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the mafia organization, are tough.
In the irons also Gioacchino Pirowalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's attorney, the namesake of the chief, already accused of commitating crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to the payment of 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," prosecutors write when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay the consultation to Piromalli's lawyer.
“This would allow the mafia group – written by the judges – officially join the municipal authorities and facilitate the already huge possibilities of public administration control and management.”
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are in his region a lot: "There are areas where the mafia concentration is stronger than in others, where collusions are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still immaculate."
Imprisonment this morning follows the incarceration of July last year, with police showing that the Mafia group Piromalli had received a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for the then expected connection between organized crime and local administration - local politicians have been deprived of their functions in municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, leader of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the right-center coalition after a narrower election in May.
He shouted over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of then-Sub-secretary Minister Marc Minniti, accusing him of devoting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the incarceration order signed this morning explain that the mafia group even reached such a far that they had asked for a change in the A3 motorway project.
From further interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, the willingness to shift the claims of a businessman, the representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now starting to be discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tide, ebbs are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the eyes of colossians such as Chevron, which is now trying to stretch out their hands at these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 70's in connection with the first oil crisis, the research has intensified.
When the price of oil decreased around 1980, the idea of using sea energy went aside. But now the environmental organization and the new increase in the price of oil have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London said in 2007 that around 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the movement of the waves of the seas.
this amount would be twice the energy currently produced in nuclear centers.
There are also currents and tides.
The giant is attacking.
The company that bet on sea energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of rising sea energy, more and more companies are more and more companies that bet on sea energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies – a spokesperson for a company that is linked to the United States’ oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal’s economic daily newspaper, said, thinking about the possibility of working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering concerns the acquisition of permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in the USA that oil continues to be mined in Alaska, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. is also tracking the sea power footprint. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about technology that is still in the early days, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to cause major problems for the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fear, which are interconnected with each other.
The force of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy is getting ashore by underwater cables.
For now, there are four devices of this type in the project phase, which are only waiting for federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already generates energy for the shopping mall and the parking lot by using six submarine turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during tides during tidal causes the turbines to rotate, which feeds the generator with this rotating motion.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations due to the possibility of using this energy.
After waves, after tides and after ebb.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential for tides, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although it is a non-continuous factor, the tide and the outflows are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It was the energy of the tide of states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coastal states, already invested $7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
