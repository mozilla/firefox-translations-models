Civil Rights Movement Issues Travel Alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Result of Colored People (NAACP) has published warnings for colorful people traveling to Missouri based on the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
“NAACP’s travel recommendation for Missouri, with effect from August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri residents to pay extra attention when travelling across the state due to a series of disputed racially motivated incidents that are currently occurring throughout the state,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took the step under the current laws of the state of Missouri, which make it difficult to defend racist acts before the court, as well as as the conduct of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“There are violations of civil rights.
People are stopped by police officers just for their skin color, they are being attacked or killed," the president of NAACP told Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We have the greatest amount of complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has issued for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization was racially motivated abuses directed toward black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a Tennessee-black man.
Sanders died under disputed circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline when traveling across the state and police plunged him into custody without charge of committing a crime.
Travel recommendations also highlight the recent statement of Missouri's Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, which states that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of being stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People must be prepared – they should bring money with them for possible payment of bail or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the state.”
According to the current FBI program figures, there were hundreds of cases of hate behavior in Missouri in 2015 in Missouri, putting the state in 16th among all states.
At the same time, the travel warning is the answer to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for suing a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) has issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration bill that allows state officials to apprehend people on the basis of a violation of this law, which ACLU is intended to improve racial profiling, according to ACLU.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Foreign Office for Foreign Countries, but recently, advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family doesn't have peace after 12 years!
The murdered model is Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl originally from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixi directly at the restaurant she worked in, who injected her with stab wounds.
Both the victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, and then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the careful criminalistic work of investigating the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for murdering and raping model Sally.
He only admitted to the assault of the juvenile in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had argued at the fateful night.
The killer said: "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said falsely.
According to his testimony, the girl should have defended herself, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stabbed her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven as a lie and charged him.
After confessing Dixie, he talked about his horniness and appetite for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt happy and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself said in the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put her hand over her mouth," Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family is facing more attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
It has been damaged four times in six months.
There are such cruel people at liberty who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter's not there anymore," the deceased girl's mother Linda revealed to the Mirror information about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudish or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started indiscriminately, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip in Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Various moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me over lunch.
His friend decided with another companion to work with the German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which impressed Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs an Intimity boutique in Prague’s Benediktská Street, where he sells erotic aids in a way that is usually offered luxury handbags or shoes.
And why wouldn't he?
They are also design items.
Moment, moment, this is what you're talking about at lunchtime, you say?
Oh, come on, don't be such puritans!
Berlin's Fun Factory store, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than everyone here is used to.
No covered shop windows, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exposed more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how to accommodate the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimity appealed to both of them.
"It's related to intimacy, after all, and it's, you can say, tender," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space that went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant prevailed, which spread the store into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom, which is dominated by a bed.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first he did not seem ideal to us, because he is not on the main street, but again he sat down to the name Intimacy.
He's intimate.
He's in the aisle next to the main one, so no one's looking at customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of the fact that they entered such a trade at all.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic aid shop.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even if there is only a female service in the store, so that women are not shy about asking for help, this does not mean that the male leg does not come here.
Mostly, gentlemen come here to shop for their girlfriends.
"Mensus usually can't guess the right size and choose a bigger one," Martin smiles at a frequent mistake.
These are those prejudices, the ingrained cliff that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black underwear, while a woman usually tends to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression on my face, it must be clear that I don't know which one beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is such a non-contact clitoral stimulator.
It is in me that the adolescent need to laugh with admiration with the serious tone with the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it wasn't huddling.
And it doesn't really mutate.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't believe he would be so well-receipt.
This is the latest revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He took care that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for couples We-Vibe.
Completely demolished the taboos that may persist for some men, namely that in erotic aids he sees the competition.
"There are different variations," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of loading vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they use it only externally.
In Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer to men," Martin says.
"We also have aids for them, but to a limited extent." Most of all, it is sold mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but “rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience when using.
It is very different in Japan.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese people are very fond of erotic aids, I object.
"That's the internet reality," he explains.
The mundanas is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women.” Just out of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we are a well-accommodating nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the store varies between 35 and 50 years of age and "she already has some experience with sex life and with some tools.
She feels good for something nice, better quality to complement her partner’s life or for herself.” Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of returning so that they convince themselves for each product to see if it is perfectly functional.
We also don’t want to go into specialties such as bondage and latex, because we don’t have space for it, on the other hand, it’s not suitable here.
Such things could be discouraged by those we are trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like this would look at them.
A lot of products on the shelves are really appealing.
It is also due to the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the aforementioned seahorse "and this triggered a change in the whole industry.
It began to be abandoned from cheap materials and, on the contrary, work with health-conscious, other designs, various colors began to be produced...
It is pleasant that the Czech is behind the design of some, namely the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those Whoop.de.doo design things from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really great deal of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know from what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big-production, but a small series, it's certainly more costly than a big series.
Maybe I’m going a bit against the tide, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna, who agrees with Martin later, describes to me that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or dismissive attitude.
Most people are embarrassed.
"But they'll start to smile too." Anna Marešová currently has a vibrator on offer, for which you can have a personal message made, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
In the year of the next, vibrating eggs and other novelties should be added.
The Boundary of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's okay is.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What one seems normal to another may seem completely abnormal, so we rather define ourselves with an assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them are allowed into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Right now, a week came an email in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural, twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
The question is, is whether someone was not kidding about us," Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
This happens from time to time...
A blow for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is battling a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend struggles with a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it's true," the singer himself confirmed the sad information to Blesk.
I know about my illness and so far I can handle it due to the circumstances.
"I take medications that have the accompanying phenomena of the disease to slow down," he added, adding that he was thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Wife Eva tries to be at home, as much as possible, to see her dad to the house on White Mountain also commutes daughters from his first marriage by Zuzana and Tereza, the old son Karel called Karlas.
Štěrý fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him during his demanding treatment.
He has sixty chemotherapy.
After them, he was able to return to the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"I've been foretold from an astrologer that I'll be here until I'm ninety," Karel told Blesk.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karl admitted.
Actress Květa Fialová is now struggling with the same disease in the institution.
Do you have a Alzheimer’s patient in your family?
Look how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be assessed by the ÚS.
In Chile, there is an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and at the end of August should be given a new president, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate 19. July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would come to an attack in court because it said it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
MPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analyzed by a mixed parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal and after them the Senate again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be criminal abortion in three cases: if a woman's life is at risk if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy originated from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, before the women were given the right to vote in 1949, according to Spanish newspaper El País, since 1946.
An absolute ban on abortions in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before leaving the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years in prison for severing a pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is Now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of the statues.
Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key advocates of the Trump regime, knew what he was about to do when, in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the subject of the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this, it would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the base, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller told Acosta, “I don’t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that casts light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal additionally, and to which you refer, is not a part of it."
Miller is really right, but as he said, this is not about history.
These are above all the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - he invites them not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let me go, who falls, who is poor, who can breathe freely, who can hardly breathe freely, who is a miserable worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “destroyed worms” on our screens.
Miller did not seek criticism of poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict of America’s significance.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high-strong political game.
The statue was supposed to express the merger of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but he has his own voice.
It also has a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
Merging a poem with a woman's idea is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American natriism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the followers of the right have long sought to reverse this meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the ground, but represents an early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It takes the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the journey to the United States."
Surprisingly, Limbaugh is alluding to an important thing.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of an exhausted and bloody traveler who, after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in the heart to a new country.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will definitely recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to inflame the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017: The World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the British team
Eilish Doyle recalls a time when British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletics Federation director Neil Black said the 16 Scots in the World Cup will be a "hugly contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Championship in 2017, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that “something strange is happening” in Scotland, and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we'll work on it," Black said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has to do with what they did.
Scottish Athletics officials think it has to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will aim for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of tremendous pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400-metre run at her fifth World Cup, said it was "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The midfielder, Muir, has set five British and two European records in the last year.
At the World Championships, he will participate in a run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500 m track. He has won the British team races and the Annual Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, which was the only Scottish team member Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team led that she was "very proud" about the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got into the team, but in many cases they will also attack participation in the final and medals.
“The extraordinary position of the team captain is that I have been elected by the other team members. It was a great honour for me, but the knowledge that I was elected by the team members is making it a pleasure.”
“I’m obviously very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It shows where we've moved.
They're athletes who will think of the top spots on the podium.
And my introductory speech?
Yes, I think she did well.
I have only drawn attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and enjoy the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance for the race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't commit to public office if you can't stand up to voter criticism
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the papers to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us – and stupid and mute we will be led as sheep to defeat.”
It brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, whom he needs to work on him to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted posts at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued for these acts by the American Union for Civil Liberties.
The governor's employees dismissed the lawsuit as unreasonable, and there were many opinions on the Internet, "Who cares."
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Yet it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an immensely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irritable.
As you can see, he directs his state with certainty to its own and strictly adheres to the principles.
It turns out that he is also agile in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a bare head after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's page - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by its employees paid with taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chase, defended the governor, saying the lockdown of comments took place from a position of moderating posts.
However, using the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who have been deleted posts.
And that is exactly what they are - the true people who speak to their chosen leaders; the teacher, the businessman and the pastor, no trolls.
As everyone mentioned, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi's lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md., has asked for hateful crimes, but her commentary was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hateful crimes and other current news," she wrote in the Washington Post's commenting section.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people to promote so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor's employees called "compromised spam interest," others would probably call "defendant."
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require the deployment of employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the district judge James C. Cacherise's first amendment in Alexandria, where it prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also made a visit from ACLU to use it on Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be that difficult.
In Washington times, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have piled up in his office criticizing his position on the agreement of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, they use more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On the one hand, they have more time to browse the web, under the parasol they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This is according to the recent statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, the majority of Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the flat rate than at home.
It is therefore not surprising that in Croatia, where a minimum of our people drive through the winter, this summer’s data consumption has risen even fifty-fold.
Italy came in second in the list of consumed data.
Most minutes Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people exchanged the book here for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s 7 was record. July.
"Tens of millions of photos would fit into the transferred data," Silvia Cieslar, director of the mobile segment at O2, said in a statement.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
First is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"In addition, through Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growths for data after the release of roaming charges, the growth is much lower for telephony.
The number of minutes called roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates here.
"The call in roaming is used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf number one Ronan Rofferty will hope for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative region of East Lothian, hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course following the way to the finals. This year, he will perform the role of the tournament ambassador to the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” he said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the course.
Jerry did a great job.
He is the ardent defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Englishman Eales will defend the championship title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about it," the Southport golfer said.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
The return to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife Sharon meant a lot to win.
It was a beautiful time I won’t forget.”
Gary Orr returns to home equity, joining the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year.
This event will be his first participation from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want you to do well and feel a lot of pressure.
I really loved playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I’m happy with the result so far.”
Former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winner Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will also join the three players on the pitch.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a fribble.
In its wooden shack, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "nota" - right into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and enjoys it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where it also performs its daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby marsh.
A bucket in a room without a roof replaces the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was assigned no field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night poses a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, there are soldiers in the village.
“In the afternoon after five o’clock, no one dares to roam around the village,” Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the outcue of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public upbringing of hands in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly reversed its anger against the Yaktar government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or overseeers of civil rights.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enorotali is such a distant and devastated city, which can be reached after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, then a five-hour stomach clutching the ride.
Public transport at this place does not work.
The city with 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, looked at this place, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, a dark T-shirt and a bright skirt.
“We used to only wear leaves.”
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the local infant mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is the Indonesian land of gold.
The largest and highest-grossing gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province of approximately New Jersey, home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging at an estimated $78 billion worth of wood.
However, these wealths are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation carried out by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military officials and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150 000 for an officer.
Papuans calling for self-government are threatening this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
Human rights activists have been killed since 1969, more than 500 000 Papuans have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the outskirts of Papua during the 1970s were tantamount to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police in the region arrested more than 3900 peaceful Protestants.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Brisbane Archdiocese of England, describes the cruelty that occurred last year as out-of-court executions, torture - according to another report, especially popular rape and execution is electrocution - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It's difficult to calculate the death toll because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravible by the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% subscribe to Christianity, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial city of Jayapura province.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - have lost their job."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowice, as part of his 2014 presidential campaign, promised to resolve inequality and rights violations.
The former carpenter secured his journey to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope of hearing our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi's inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a big shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at the campfire in the city of Enorotali when two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the gloom of the night on motorbikes.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this complaint and the tone in which she was uttered and later returned with four other soldiers, local parish priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state pursued a group of children and beaten them with the stocks of their weapons, the victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
Hours later, someone set fire to the nearby building of the electoral commission, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field outside the local police station and army headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which they run in a circle and imitated the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants have started throwing rocks on the buildings.
With escalating tension, soldiers were ordered over the radio: "If the crowd tries at least three times to resist, you have permission to shoot," the TIME weekly said in an official document, the contents of which were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Enotali district, Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to break into their homes.
No one had neglected his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told the TIME weekly on the ponder of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who the shooter was yet, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times in his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to my body to make sure it's really him," Yohanes, who uses only one name, told TIME, a sullen voice.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him.”
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely “assuring” a station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said Pudyo Sulistiyo, a spokesperson for the Papuan police in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped with injuries.
The news of the murders went through the Jakart media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowice gave a passionate speech in Jayapuria and expressed his understanding for the victims' families and promised to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again," he said.
In October 2016, National Security Secretary Wiranto announced that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have taken place in the past.
Almost immediately, however, there were excuses.
“Most of the acts of violence have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them happened in the 90's of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we're determined to punish these acts with violence, but it won't be an easy task," he said.
In the interview of 5. However, for the TIME weekly, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he does not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, “all cases will be referred to the court.”
Wiranto, whom the UN accused of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in Timor - said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniaic incident, have been settled so far.
Families of the victims of the shooting in Pania welcomed his claims with disbearance.
"I've been asked a total of four times in the last three years, but I've never seen anything before," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai, who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beatiphaned by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying my bodies, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting is not yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighboring Deiya.
The scuffle, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred among the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angered villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the members and the answer was a warning gunfire.
Locals, however, claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitaristic police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were panicked, we were afraid of payback,” said Dominggu Badia, a 29-year-old living near a hospital and witnessing the arrival of the injured.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the participating police officers and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous people of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels that protect Papuan rights by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai. It is not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "providing national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place."
The oil is pouring poverty into the fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enorotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is equally unattainable.
Local residents grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them tills four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is designed for the needs of the family, the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants have begun to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
More educated and richer immigrants usually occupy jobs for so few jobs.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to embark on business.
"Young people are moving out of villages for lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists were expelled from Papua - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - because of the "lack of cooperation with the authorities", all this despite the fact that they were given such a rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the human Rights Watch Asia branch, Jokowice, in his election campaign, promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. But this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisted," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists' pens means that international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of "different and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the panic in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir has shaken off the accusation when he told reporters in Jakarta that: “In Indonesia, a democratic system is still in place and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people proclaimed, according to a source who also attended the session, but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want freedom."
There are next elections scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but Papuans say they won't vote for Jokowice.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people connected with shootings in Paniai," Gobau, chairman of the tribal council, said.
He wants Jokowice to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of the plundering army - are rolling in poverty, poor education and health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote to be the “debt” that Jokois must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of victims of the Panian shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of defiant: they bury the bodies of the victims on the grounds opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not allow the responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has intercepted a huge delivery of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy detained a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
During the intervention, a four-member crew of the ship was arrested, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named As Afalina, sailed from South America, and police dragged her to a port in the town of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence agency said it would, in cooperation with its international partners, to set out exactly where and where the drugs were going and to reveal the "litean syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs bound for Australia," said its chief executive Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers because of high street drug prices.
The country is also facing a problem with an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first lately.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, the solution could be infusions of saline, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only applied in healthcare facilities.
The older a person gets, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"And in addition, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally receive less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," Mádlová said.
Two litres should be drunk for sure.
"But getting so much fluids into an old person is a big deal," she added.
In homes for the elderly, she says, this is often not guarded by any doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is commonly dealt with by infusions.
"I think there, too, it should be gradually introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, according to her, up to two pint bottles of saline solution can be supplied to the elderly.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get up from bed, he speaks confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, a maximum cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more difficult to nurse, but it would be ideal to occasionally expose the patient and let the skin ventilated," the doctor said.
The Torch skyline burned for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai on Friday, one of the largest residential skyscrapers in the world was on fire. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents 337 meters high and 79-storey buildings.
In the last two years, it is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Torch).
All the residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and we were awakened by an alarm. We heard screaming.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the occupants of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai's civilian defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around four o'clock in the morning (0:00 GMT), whereupon they continued to cool the building.
Government officials have added that they would provide alternative accommodation for disabled residents.
The incident could once again spark a discussion about the safety of materials used to lining high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation launched by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
British police said the system of isolation and lining of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
Survey results show that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. is leaking banned items on board a plane
A passenger survey showed that more than twenty percent knowingly or unconsciously uttered banned items through the U.S. government's administration's Office Security Administration checkpoint on board the aircraft. At least six per cent of passengers entered the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they were belatedly discovering that they had travelled with a firearm, ammunition or explosive.
The results of the survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and which answered more than 1,000 queries - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried knowingly to travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers were traveling with several thousand hours of flying compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Among the most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly uttered a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately carried the banned drugs to the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them randomly uttered unauthorized items through airport control and how much it did on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have transferred unauthorized items - consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and in what quantities they can carry on the plane.
Unsurprisingly, TSA has seized the largest amount of the currently banned fluid.
For some time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
The transport of fluids is allowed in domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on delayed directives to reduce Obama administration emissions
After the Environment Agency was sued for fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt dismissed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes in his plan. It reacts more briskly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal call filed against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last date, which was set at 1. October, when countries should start complying with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who held the position of state attorney general Oklahoma before being appointed head of the EPA by President Donald Trump, served for a long time as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since it settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industry.
A sudden Wednesday's turnaround is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the bailiff of the EPA exceeded its authority in an effort to delay the inclusion of a Obama administration plan that required diesel and gas companies to cut methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with states through complex processes and meet new standards within a given time frame.
"Under the administration of the previous EPA administration, it often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to the settlement and further setting up the plans," said Pruitt, who has filed more than a dozen lawsuits at the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation by litigation and take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our statute and authority that results from it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may use “delay and all other legally available authorities” at a certain point to ensure that regulation “issued on sound policies and the most accessible information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcript of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month is seeking delays in implementing the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"The turnaround in the views of the EPA - the following our judicial over - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is produced when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists acknowledge Pruitt's sudden change with gratitude.
“It’s worrying what pressure needs to be put to change the mindset of those responsible and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Biological Diversity Center.
“We must continue to wrestle with the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests.”
He pouring acid on the man, but he is not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
At one point you are at home with your family and laughing, in the other suddenly your whole life changes from the ground up.
And the worst thing is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopheros from the UK, who was patted his face by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone at Christophers knocked on the door.
Andreas has risen to open.
He thought he was probably behind the door, probably a courier who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he had never seen in his life immediately after opening without warning poured acid with the words, "That's for you, mate."
The pain was indescrime.
My clothes fell on me like nothing, and I felt just an unbelievable pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family quickly transported him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent affected by the face that doctors tried to put together with the skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A big complication for Christopheros was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the gruzziest thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today, Christopheros has completed twelve surgeries that are far from the last.
Injuries that suffer victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims of the tissues scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformation and disfigure all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aeste Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure an unknown man must have mistaken him with someone.
The perpetrator believed that he was revenge on a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police investigated the case properly and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the astonishment of Christopheros' family fundamentally changed.
"These judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be overturned as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said in a statement.
Over the past few years, the number of incarnations in caustom infecting has increased considerably.
The Ministry of the Interior has commented on the issue that it plans to set new instructions to prosecutors regarding the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks, however, are not going to give up.
They demand that the UK government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require that the controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as these are various detergents.
In Dubai's largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, was burning at night.
According to Dubai's civil defense, the residents of the eighty-story building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"This started on the 67th floor, that's how they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We slept.
We were woken up by an alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another witness to CNN estimated that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when the burning parts of the building fell on them.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense communication, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its creation is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the current went off.
The large-scale fire also damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was harmed, because the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and then became the world's tallest residential building with its 352 meters.
He was deprived of the record the following year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The bodybuilder had a whopping 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra newspaper, a diverse collection of illicit means was found in a sample of twenty-three-year-old Ippolito - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year distancing and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vast tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was by then a record number of athletes caught.
A third-league player said he began taking steroids a year before he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged her with a former lover!
As a matter of Lucka Vondráčková has entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And he also draws attention wherever he goes.
The last time her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years, fell into her arms.
The actor was 12 years older and longed for his family.
Lucie was only 19 years old at the time and she certainly did not want to hang her career on the nail.
So they went apart, but they remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the press conference of TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
Coincidibly, they both matched themselves to blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they bonded and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes until she fell behind her belly.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, because they will play together a lover couple in the new series Primy Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life in the UK for preparing the assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell to life imprisonment, which called the Three Musketeers and, according to prosecutors, was planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
The four men, two of whom took part in a training camp in Pakistan and have previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities thought he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, the security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "infidels" in Arabic, and a mock-up of a gun.
This happened when an employee of the MI5 secret service was deploying a listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed what horror the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," prosecutors' deputy Sue Hemming said.
Three convicts, aged 28, 25 and 33, can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car placed by an MI5 agent there.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In the Hodonín region they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, it was beatered by Thursday, which became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, not many temperature records were set on Tuesday on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or offset at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region on Thursday 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice in the Brno region the current 37.1 grades exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
There were ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures on Thursday appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the largest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, in Western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to grow only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the CHMI, the current heatwave in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions due to visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exercise its influence without the use of means of power.
Every year, it spends ten billion dollars to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry into foreign markets, trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing well.
State media there speaks of a plan to make tourism a driving force in economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals rose by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists came to China from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, by the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the world’s most populous country, professor of economics from Beijing University Christopher Balding, in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, the citizens of the others have to take out their visa in advance.
At the Chinese authorities in the U.S., the crowds are comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line for it, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions build significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the country's number by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and has less than one percent of all the population, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself when tourism is used to realize its political goals, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift around the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans retaliated against it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw a rise of 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent published report by the US central bank, the Fed may have left China as low as $190 billion as a result of foreign Chinese travel, while China receives about $35 billion a year as part of selling currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equivalent to 44 percent of China’s entire surplus in the trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, the country that anxiously prevents the outflow of capital is inflicting a very painful blow.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in China.
There are many in the United States and some individual cities.
Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, is double.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
You will not find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is the simplification of the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and make visa procedures cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
They multiplied deadly poisonous reptiles in Pilsen Zoo.
The Kingdom of Pilsen can enjoy the cubs of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newborn Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It also grows in lengths," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba said.
The young of the other two species, the death-bearers and the red cobra, will be gaining strength in the breeding facilities of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them.
"We would not like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Australian viper death residents have been born eight, they are descendants of a breeding couple originating from a population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exposition belong to the deathworms from around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, wintering for the deathbrowns is necessary for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting cobra red.
A couple in Pilsen Zoo hatched a total of four eggs a total of four cubs.
"The Incubation took 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of up to four meters.
He's aiming at the eyes, it can cause lasting blindness.
The chicks of all three species feed on mice in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, the chicks from the clutch of the mamba are still waiting for the black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to unverified transcript of telephone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico over payment for border wall
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump urged him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president reproached him for publicly denouncing the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and proclaimed that Mexico would pay for it.
The transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnboll also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S.-sustained deal over refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous” and “sick” and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal – which emerged under President Obama – would look “treached” after proposing a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk testified at prosecutor's office again for Smolensk.
"It has something to fear," Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of the ruling Law and Justice party PiS, said in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczynski won't insult me," Tusk said, reproached the country's current leadership for trying to abuse the judiciary against political rivals.
When leaving the headquarters of Prosecutor's Office, a crowd waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, the crowd chanting Donald Tusk! and wished the politician One Hundred Years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to worry about and Kaczynski will not insistured me."
He says he does not blame prosecutors, but he does not doubt that the judiciary should serve as an instrument against opponents, opposition or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was in questioning for the second time.
The ex-premier was questioned at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation was supposed to concern misconduct in the autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, it was discovered for the confusion of bodies in coffins.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there must have been some reasons for this.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal, because they would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," Kaczynski said on Twam Catholic television.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would thwart Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczynski said he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could go differently with Donald Tusk, but it did not take note.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many regarded his summons for questioning as part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking various scandals.
Prosecutors in Poland are subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who performs the role of Prosecutor General.
The summons for questioning came soon after the election of Tusk as the head of the European Council, whom Kaczynski tried in vain to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone at the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House of Representatives from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassies since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This is based on the decree governing the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, it is currently in the comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10 thousand Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explains its procedure.
"In some countries, new embassies have been created, some authorities have been closed, or the level of representation has been changed," the document reads.
The Decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies on which paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
Another more than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
It is their list that changes with the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote for example at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, the two embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in Bamaka, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
He will not vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
Newly, they are on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Senegalese capital Dakar and Zambia Lusaka.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation since the last parliamentary elections to include a consulate general in Iraq's Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan province.
Ballots will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose MPs at polling stations at embassies or consulates so far four times.
Before each election, the state electoral commission will determine the region for whose candidates are voting abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the decision was made between the South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was selected as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
Around 3800 people came to vote at the premiere 15 years ago, in 2006 there were about 6700, and four years later 8222.
The early elections of the Chamber of Deputies four years ago were attended by the 10,571 voters.
Moore's Ford Massacre: activists commemorate racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia and the cod to the Moore's Ford Bridge.
However, before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of whites with weapons blocked his path.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - scooped up from a cigarette for a long time and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We're going to, the n-- and Roger!" the man yelled.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence breaks the roar of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of events that occurred 22. July.
But when one of the men throws a noose over the “Roger’s” neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to the Moore's Ford Bridge regularly, reconstructing that fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by Kukluxklan members.
No one has been tried for murder.
“It’s a wonder that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the refurbishment.
“It is a stain on our history and the burden in our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia Congressman and a lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call for action. Every year, the Monroe community reminds us that justice has not been done to enough.
"We demand trial prosecution and conclusion of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated.”
The medical examinek covers 27. July 1946, one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were scheduled to take part in the lynching.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, based on a decision by the Supreme Court, black-skinned residents of the state of Georgia were given the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a black-skinned farmer, Roger Malcom, who was supposed to stab white-skinned owner Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was said that Hester had been in a business with Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, he composed 25. July 1946 then-prove owner of the white-skinned land Loy Harrison for Malcoma bail of $600.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Returning from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their journey.
"As it turns out, Harrison planned the murders," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law protectors who not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks commented more briefly on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all local black people: ‘this is how you end up if you register and vote’.”
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized for nearly a decade by Cassiandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise. It shows deep-rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to turn away your eyesight, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there can’t be a relationship between us unless you hear what I had to go through.”
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day, approximately 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks - rushed into the room where Greene introduced them to the very carefully scheduled performance.
Wade Marbaugh holds the position of auxiliary director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but in his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, or Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom argues with Hester and accuses him of sleeping with his wife.
"Getting off my property n---e!"
Rascon can't be.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) explodes in a laughing stock.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene says cheerfully.
"I just don't think the white people said 'n--r' in that tone."
"Exactly," one black actor blurts out.
“You have to put more emphasis on R.”
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Just to be done as four victims of the massacre.
Actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct word on N.
No one laughs anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The scream, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of actors and sings the grieving song of Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
With each word, there is sadness in the room.
In the backdrop of all this, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are virtually the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came all the way from New York's Ithaya, many onlookers are from nearby.
Each of them endures the local damp climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in the crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders could have been viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching occurred, the atmosphere is haunted.
With the last words of the song, Greene will challenge the crowd on footage to inspect the bodies.
Children are knelt at the heads of the victims, watching fake blood and immobile bodies, and whispering something in their ear.
"They're not dead," the little boy says.
A few minutes goes by, and Greene thanks the audience. It's over.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, a man in a suit played by the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two friends-actor and cries in their arms; in the end, emotion is weighed on him.
"It's all right," one woman whispers.
"We know you hate the role.
But you had a reason for that.”
Later on the same day, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talk about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Dupllinski barely found the words to express her feeling of today's performance.
“It’s difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous deeds... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic,” she added, “just called police scuffles.”
On the other side of the room sits Tyrone Brooks in the courtroom. He enjoys dinner and talks about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the show for another year.
“Reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think,” he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friend says that only a coward reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times long past, where the instructions for using anything was rather a rarity phenomenon.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which there were hieroglyphs depicting the wiring of some components, all of them were some secret marks.
When something inside went wrong after years, I offered that list to the shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the backboard.
With a smirk, he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of the line is suitable for.
Yes, it was a habitual tool in the chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He easily found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl pancakes again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where simply adhered to the cut strep, required about ten pictures.
Especially good was the sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The kit was two-part and another procedure was simply not possible.
Giving it vice versa required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for instructions ended with my SEAT Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the blinker bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work should have been done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to say that while the bulb on the right went really to replace really only in three steps.
1. separate the cover.
2. unscrack the cracked bulb and screw a new one.
3. put the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowel of the car, I would have a spring, a screw to which I could easily move the cover and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
The footbridge error.
The cover had no space, no space even for the slender hand of the Ashtray, let alone the obese Silesian.
I lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was further enhanced by my wife's entrance into the garage, which was summoned by the roar and the words that hear from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked guilelessly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit vulgar terms, there were only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" she took a risk of a sentence that could be her last in a long-lasting volume.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the procedure of the torture of the author of the instructions, where the blessed with the hot iron on the hand, which wrote the instructions, then by her tangle, so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide range of Witch Hammer instructions, including his commissional burning on the top above the Losinsky Castle.
"How about dismantling the box?" the woman said of the battery dismantling.
In pure despair, this happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just waking up from the collapse state after checking two clerics of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced possible and impossible in the field and who can interpret even wild stories in an unspeakable voice.
"Imagine getting a fine for not putting up hand-washing instructions," he said in a weak voice.
Gradually, I dug out the whole problem, which was that above the sink in the toilet of patients does not have a picture instructions on how to wash your hands.
His argumentation by the commission clerk that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the accustomed activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinse of soapy palms through running water is a primitive act at the level of the Cro-Lion, that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
In this way, it is necessary to say that it is necessary to let water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyful realization that a person washed his hands exactly as ordered by the hostuary of SÚKL.
Finally, I have to say that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the operation in the toilet.
In the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, in the case of urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang out the instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure also means a precise drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse a certain outrage in the prudish visitor of the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has been moping the appropriate opening with a completely wrong procedure throughout his life.
Pearson to lay off another 3000 employees and cut dividend in bid to revive business
Britain's educational group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3000 employees and cut the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
The next wave of redundancies, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, is followed by a previous decision by the company to lay off 4000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by an additional $300 million in May under the third cost reduction program in an effort to resurrect trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month approved the sale of its stake in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one percent increase in base sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were wounded, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a statement by NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the city district of Qarabagh.
This month, a bombing hit Afghanistan - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Heratian mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In its statement, NATO said Tuesday's blast occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a home-made explosive device."
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger to life and are located in a U.S. military hospital at the Bagram air base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a significant source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb placed in a car killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people. This is the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S. troops overthreshold the Taliban's government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops who should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to the reporters, the suicide attacks, which schools in recent weeks have shaken public confidence in the government, its regulations and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanine.
In response to lawsuit, the EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to delay the Obama administration's law, which ordered states to reduce emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to refer "Ozone Standards 2015" with the statement that it is presenting the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views," EPA director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's efforts to delay ozone standards - which measures actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine the limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of the Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - Trump's words in an attempt to kick economic growth.
But the efforts of the new government have launched countermeasures from Democrats and Conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that ozone air breathing "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood was flowing!
This, in our country a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this hitherto almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in the Czech Republic, at which he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show itself to the public and to present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was taken by the just-named personalities.
But few people already know that the recording of the video itself, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big filming with the stars of the Russian national ballet and could not do without a proper embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's rival was supposed to indicate a blow of slaps in the video.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and straight into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my blood immediately lowered my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers discussed the situation on set that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not manage to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the sequel in the next filming.
We now bring you the video clip of the young artist, you can also record the scene with a stroke.
However, the unsuccessful version with blood was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko talk at the meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting light-welterweight boxing match, met for the first time in Tuesday's meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room in the ESPN offices of Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated light-weight champion World Boxing Council - did not come down to the hall, where he welcomed Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's feaderweight champion.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's showtime match, both boxers made it to the top five light-welterweight boxers.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck.”
Lomačenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19: 00.
Boxers pose for photographers, and manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential match of boxers would be a “perfect test”.
"I'm a former featherweight champion," Garcia adds.
“Because of the fight with Broner (67 kg), I had to gain weight, but I’m not that big.
I'm small for my 63 kg.
I would like to return to the light-weight category.
The slasher has to gain weight again in order to get lightly... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not meet them.”
Lomačenko agrees.
“The box would benefit this game.”
Klimas made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko is expected to make his light-weight debut at the end of this year and next year he will face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on September 23 for the light-welterweight title in the Forum Arena.
"The match should take place in the style of payment for viewing, that's what fans demand," Garcia said, who later said that the possibility of broadcasting the match through a TV station that comes with the best bid was open.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw that much attention.
We’ll wait for the right opportunity...”
Garcia said he recognized Lomashenko as an "amazing boxer" and could take part in his Saturday fight.
But he couldn't lull Garcia's praises when he said the champion of the three divisions of Riverside looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then boxing.
Both boxers said they felt the rising tension before the duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other match attracts as much attention.
And I'll put it on the fire with great comfort," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match.”
The young couple disappeared without a trace of 12 years ago.
Their car was now found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova have been missing since December 2005.
There was a large-scale search for them, but without success.
And the police eventually closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
Families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years came the sad ending of the whole story.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Čeboksary in Chuvash.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The document survived the decade underwater, without them it would take the police much longer to find out the identity of the found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his find to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the death of a young couple was an accident caused by an icy road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, after its completion, further details will be published.
Latest test results to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were surveyed as over the age of 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalveket) has begun conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants in the context of the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has handed over 6880 cases to investigate, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests, conducted from mid-March to 31. July 2017.
80 percent (2002) was assessed as over the age of 18, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency concluded that the interviewee was "permayd over the age of 18."
In the other 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was “perhaps under the age of 18”.
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensoid Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are on track and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases it was found that "a person who is 18 years or older."
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondents said he would be 18 years old this year.
The medical method of determining age, which includes an X-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which is subsequently assessed by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is involved in assessing, among other things, the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person passed puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurement to assess age are correct.
In a sense, judging a biological age is very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age with precision, we shouldn't pretend the opposite," Metro told the newspaper.
Forensic medical agency Agency's GÃ¶ransson defended the decision by saying: "Generally speaking, the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person surveyed is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a January phone call from Mexican President Enrique Peño, threatened not to meet him if he said publicly that his country will not pay for the construction of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that he would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump spoke similarly openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbol.
This is according to transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump told Peňa Niet undiplomatically for opposing himself critical of his plan to build the wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed for the Mexican president not to publicly say his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue defiant statements.
Funding is said to be going to come up somehow and it will turn out well in the end.
"But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I don't want to associate with you anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," Trump said.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall was issued shortly after taking power.
Mexico refuses to build and finance the wall with a length of 3200 kilometers, and the relations of the two countries have also escalated.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be in place for the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull of January 28.
The White House chief of staff called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted by an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to accept persons from internment facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump initially considered the deal stupid, but later accepted it.
"You can certainly say that this is not the deal you made, but you will have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised as a good idea for Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation esculated.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people who go to work for local milkmen," he said.
He also noted in an interview that a refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world leaders at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House.
Finally, he called the conversation with Turnbull the least pleasant all day.
Before he finished it, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the murderer Rana in front of the crowd.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place on the square in the capital of Yemen Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari as his victim, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took his father to the house, where he raped her and strangleled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed mob who gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
After the execution, the victim's father told the media his feelings.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd shouting the slogan "Long live justice".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van, from which he was dragged out.
Officers put him on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his weapon on him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd celebrated every blow that was burned.
Mr. Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was carried out in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia Law won," he added.
I stood in the Liberation Square in the Saga, waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
My wife, Jamileh, is grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful madness, grab the killer and lynch.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act aroused such outrage that the judge had decided the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance 27. June.
Ranna's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his house, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described it as a set.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that carried Rana's body were terrible," he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, the posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes the police received a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of the horrific act.
The girl's mother, Jamil, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out playing out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where she was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
Yemeni residents were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Justice Department read the crowd a recording of the investigation to calm them down.
The accused seemed to show no regrets about his act.
Just before his sentence, the police read his sentence, but the convict only looked at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many records on the Internet that the crowd took.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Political Party
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a rally of President Trump that he was crossing into another party.
"Whatever you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Justice Governor said.
“Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I am announcing to you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I am telling you that I cannot continue to support you from the position of a democratic governor.”
The crowd of onlookers erupted into joy.
"I'll sign up for Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you that it’s time to jump into another game.”
Trump has previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the country, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice has inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: “The overrun of the Governor of the Judiciary is another blow to the Democratic Party that puts obstacles in our way, instead of making it up to our country’s uplift.”
“For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative authorities in history, the announcement of the Justice governor is the last straw for an already miserable leader-free party that seeks in vain to find a positive and unifying report,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincerity' apology for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the time to return Russia to the sports world.
The head of Russian athletics, Dmitry Shylakhtin, on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World of Athletics Championships - that the expulation of his country from the world of sport was right and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban that came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
“I think today we have seen a very honest response and presentation,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
“All members of the council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working with all its strength to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has done very well and we have advanced to the next level, but the congress supports the crisis staff’s recommendation to maintain the punishment that has been thrown on Russia,” Coe added.
“In the coming months, we need to do our best to stabilise the situation.
Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from the dishonest ones,” he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have met the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF's chief crisis staff chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being admitted back.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and excluded coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF board.
The state contract of CzechTrade was awarded to the company František Savov, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The Pro-export Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract in April for the four-year provision of content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract worth CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the Mladá fronta publishing house entrepreneur František Savov.
In 2014, the Czech police have accused him of tax evasion and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of news server Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original criteria of CzechTrade, the award was to be decided by the award of the contract by 60 percent the offered price and the remaining 40 beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
Savov's company was greatly helped by the second criterion.
According to Dotyk.cz, it received one hundred points in all partial criteria of quality.
This was the result that moved her to the next candidate, the Vltava Labe publishing house Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with the amount of 404 900 crowns per month, the VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received a below-average rating from the assessors in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like news server Aktuálně.cz, belongs to the Economia publishing house.
The VLM publishing house has filed several objections against the outcome of the tender, saying that it considers its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office of the Office of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade proceeded in violation of the law.
"The petitioner is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a supplier of a public contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favoring the participant of Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the petitioner and other suppliers," reads the proposal to initiate proceedings filed at the Office this week, which was published by the server News.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an implausible and one hundred percent assessment of the Mladá fronta project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as improbable and suspicious," Klima told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are closed.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the completion of the contract, a complete written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot comment on its progress," Štěpán Dlouhý, a media representative of the agency, told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded by saying that it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was given in the article.
The tender could help her that she provided BusinessInfo content management services in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is accusing the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused up to 770 million crowns of alleged damage to the Czech state.
The Czech Republic has been asking Great Britain to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose influence falls on the Mafra publishing house, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, a London court rejected Savov’s appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK on the acquisition of the legal force of the judgment to this day," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Mladá fronta, Savov was involved in the company Harvester Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiling itself as an investment fund, buying at risk of assets.
It should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the introduction of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist drove down the sidewalks and park, ended up in somersaults.
The motorcyclist attracted attention with a reckless ride on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to drive her in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers chased the man with extra caution by the city when he did not manage to drive on one of the side roads behind Marianske Lazne and drove the motorcycle into the field, where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the Pilsen hospital.
Later, the police found that the motorcyclist did not own a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number polished and the production label itself removed.
It's possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"The breath test was ruled out at the scene of the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," a police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will not in any way disrupt Neymar's record-breaking transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules that introduced UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
This is followed by several financial conditions of Neymar's transfer to France.
With the PSG team being funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has made it rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on the purchase of players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of business activities related to football.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after being put in the UEFA director's seat in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that would become indebted in the pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP rules redirected its attention from club debts to monitor their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spent exorbitant sums on players to build a global brand - suddenly it was not so profitable.
As part of the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Chefferin is determined to advocate a ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” Andrea Traverso told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a one-time payment, it may spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for the purposes of accounting.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down at EUR 44.4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions FFP hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to €20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG once the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the PSG's Qatar Tourism Authority was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar's revenue in PSG could be paid from the organizational committee of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and the leaders of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's initiated persons, UEFA did not initiate any investigation into the PSG's transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous, as he is not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been disclosed.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Spanish league officials, clearly concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break the FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ of the club and the state,” La Liga Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by a Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's same position on the club's financing.
“It’s the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as the club owner becomes the state, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomas Rosicky is going to the set.
Same scene as in Sunday's match against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder moved the game against Crvena Zvezda, he invented several goals, but his teammates did not go into the black.
The Letná team pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements will end after the opening double match in the European Cups.
Was it hard to do anything about the game after the goal of Belgrade?
After the goal, four had to be scored, which was difficult for us.
At least we wanted to lose, to raise our confidence so that we had something to rebound from in the next matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is very well worked.
The combination of the opponent was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we shot maybe once in half-time.
That's obviously very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponents more often into such positions.
Is the problem the number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We played only three competitive matches and the line-up is still changing.
The point is for the coach to find the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it encouraging you to have played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just parts of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have happened in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It's the same with the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they were embarrassed.
What can you say to them?
There was an amazing visit again, just like with Bohemka.
I am so sorry that we can not make them happy with a better performance.
Show something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can the season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so it is not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is supposed to serve for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve ten years in prison for cutting taxes to a significant extent.
The estimated damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that the judiciary violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, constitutional judges described the complaint as unfounded, the Czech News Agency found from the court's database.
The US is not another appeals court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, consider factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in the issue custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision-making of the ÚS.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage incurred.
The High Court called the case an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was created only for the period from January to July 2008, the total leak, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT levies and excise duty in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded are related to entrepreneur Radomír Vybíral, to whom the judiciary has been sentenced to 13 years in prison for fuel trading.
His complaint was also dismissed by the Constitutional Court ago.
"Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" series play on the nostalgic string
This story iteration is nostalgic for both characters from the famous 1980s; and for the dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced a comedy sketch on MTV “The State”); and of course for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd fled to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the point of view of the franchise, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well – not only because of the absurd humor (an example of the story of the making of a talking can of vegetables, which was voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors have moved away from the main witty point - middle-aged actors who play horny children - and couldn't make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults do not push so much on the emotional level and the satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of a thriller from the 90's as "Hand on the Cradle."
At one point, the character finds a haraburd Apple Powerbook, a roller skate and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The kind-hearted Coop (pan Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't moved over his love of Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is instigated by George H. W. Bush (Very Well-occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of franchise.
It is especially amused to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair, aka the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once-respected character Andy is now the old paprik.
The franchiza could be started by moments of random madness, such as the return of the "Seven Up" series until it reaches what I suppose it will be a logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the entire group will go to the premiere of "Summering Years".
“Comrade Detective” on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals for a different type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War series “Such Normal Americans,” the film “Atomic Blonde: Without Regret” and even the “GLOW” series, which clashes icons of the Eastern and Western West Wrestling scenes.
The comedy of the creators of Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania of the 80's of the last century, who have fought for truth and a theaism of Marxism-leanning.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Ioseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which they dubbed the English language Channing Tatum (executives of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it’s not much more.
For some jokes, you laugh (such as police officers watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was lent by many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigna.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer with the Reagan mask - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too long, and there aren't enough comedic moments.
With a shorter footage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat people devour hamburgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message for the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes have not been lifted for the ban on launches from the IAAF.
At a congress in London, the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has confirmed an extension of the international ban on Russian competitors due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The vote in the venue of the World Championship, which will begin on Friday, was as expected very unequivocal.
166 delegates voted in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the head of the IAAF special investigative group, Rune Andersen, stated before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been questioned, and in the country still work coaches with a damaged reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, while Russian athletes lost last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will take part in the upcoming World Cup, who have previously proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to compete in national colours at the championship and in case of victory they will not play the Russian national anthem.
Bank of England to hold interest rate at 0.25%
As expected, the Bank of England should announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by a lackluster economic growth and a weakening of inflation that has stifled speculation about sharp growth.
England's bank has warned that economic growth would remain "behind" in connection with maintaining the interest rate - despite the squeeze in family budgets.
Political figures from the Bank of England voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote for the interest rate increase supported the lackluster economic growth, supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that the reduction in family budgets would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years due to inflation caused by Brexit, and it also said that wealth rentals should rise more in financial markets than expected.
The members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Temporary Financing Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should start to apply from next February, although the Bank of England said it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £15 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: "MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption."
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would be necessary to “tighten the belts of money policy” to calm inflation, “to a higher rate” than markets.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "limited."
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The expected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter, up from 0.2% of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly by the bank at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a slight comfort for households hit by rising inflation and poor pay rises. The bank said the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income reductions in the coming years, but wages are expected to "significantly" rise towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also rise due to the great interest in UK goods thanks to the weak pound, which will compensate for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to a shocking EU referendum vote, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates along with rising inflation, which put more and more pressure on households. Three political figures demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June's 2.9%, despite the bank saying it had expected such a change and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank said the relative exceedance to 2% of the target was "completely" as a result of a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only rise as creditors start competing for contracts with a view of the good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those whose existing contracts and remorse ends - there are options in the offer, as well as low rates they gain in popularity."
NHS Prescribes Controversial HIV Drug 10 000 Patients
Patients will have access to ‘transformative’ treatment to HIV prevention from September based on a decision by the Supreme Court to finance the NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year probationary period.
The NSH agreed to finance the probationary period after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court's decision last year, stating that the NHS has funds to pay for the PreP despite statements that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention' while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV.
Tests have shown that the PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among vulnerable patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexuals or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not treated successfully.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign consent to participation in testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the UK GP can also apply in their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will cost taxpayers £10 million, and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute medicines after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is proposed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of the PREA, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and fully exploit the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, NAT (National Aids Trust), said: ‘We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If the PrEP is administered correctly and at risk for patients, it will offer the possibility of a transformation of the English HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients who are at high risk of HIV infection with a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
Now we have a prep test drug available and we are well on our way to protect more than 10 000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The start of the prePE exam period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and termination of transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will take us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that we start the tests as soon as possible across the country to protect those exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on a high foot: the mezzanine and the smart design have turned this small apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a big house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne smart terrace - and is an illustrative example of modern design, which uses the most accessible space.
"Before, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge," Joanne said in a statement.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him and I nodded to him the same day.'
Since then, an apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the storage space and the mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of the design and design studio Duck & Shed based in Notting Hill and used the nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps would fit above each other - the challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine on which you could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time to bend the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of him - while adding drama.
On the mezzanine, he overlooks the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the Retrouvisus design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window for the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors for the storage of cutlery and jars.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, are the folding door.
“We had to solve the technical side,” Erfan talks about the reinforced veneered door.
"The door is provided with a counterweight to be draped very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne received an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living area - or the valuation of your property," Erfan said.
“A real estate agent basically calculates when entering the apartment estimates its price based on the living area.”
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t fall in love with electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won't get your heart."
As it turns out, quality design and increase of living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally choose to stay.
The United States is contingling.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliates and declared a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
The point is that California has banned spending state money on the journey of its citizens to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop the madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and any expression of disapproval of LGBT lifestyles is considered discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a law on the objection of conscience, according to which a psychotherapeut, who has a moral problem with the therapy of patients from the LGBT community, has no obligation to provide it to them, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that received children from mothers after birth for adoption are not required to provide same-sex couples with adoptions.
Because of these laws on the objection of conscience, California banned the financing of its citizens' travels to eight EU states by its means.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have travel to scientific symposia, for example, reimbursed from their universities in Texas, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions to Tennessee, for example, with the financial support of their schools.
They must either receive federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance citizens’ trips from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and his parliament passed a law with a resolution that he also dislikes California's high tax policy, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but he still doesn't impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
It imposes them as a retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every EU country, which would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go for and what they are not allowed for.
Secondly, what is wrong with the objection of conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem to sell pork, why can't he offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under the saline, to force him to sell even pork, when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or alcohol.
Why punish him and not leave it alone and not order the relevant cakes from hundreds of bakers of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policy in competences that are not federal, according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas, and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and let them live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance for themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one can ever show moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle again, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history, when states have done such a purpose because of political issues, except the case of the only one.
Even at the time of the struggle for the civil rights of the blacks, where North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the segregation side, states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 50's of the 19th century, the political case was slavery and the war of the North against the South was coming.
Of course, there will be no such thing now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between the states of the blue Democratic and the Red Republican states are deepening, and the US is mentally intervening.
Unauthorized agitation.
A critic of Putin has been fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300 thousand rubles for violating the campaign rules ahead of the presidential election next year.
The court imposed a fine on him for inviting people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has orchestrated two major anti-government street protests in the past two months, announcing that he wants to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The incumbent head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but it is widely expected to do so and to win again.
Navalny said the police came home to him this morning and took him away from the court.
He was fined him for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube internet portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"Laters will tear them down the judge's salary," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot participate in the presidential election because it was previously convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
Fines of 300 thousand rubles, or 25 thousand rubles, were also imposed on Thursday by two members of the Navalny pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
Authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign in every way possible.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence because he robbed the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running according to Russian law.
Brothers fight over $500 million worth of empire
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, tug-of-head one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides on Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has driven the dispute over the common property and business fortune to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly being denied before the supreme court.
Along with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which has grown into a chain with 160 brick-and-mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
Additional properties were purchased with the money, and the De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is, Paul's "significant driving force and dominant figure" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court files say Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages real estate for $176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and funds has become problematic.
"Colin's proposal sounded significant in my eyes in his favor," Paul wrote in a 2015 court in a 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at a settlement, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from whom Paul, according to his statement, Colin cut off.
Colin contradicts that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
The cost of court standing is rising. Hundreds of pages of affiliates, emails and messages from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, flood lawyers with attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys of both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicacies since the 50's of the 20th century and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 70's.
With the money raised by the pledge of the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his final year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take a good time.
"Luigi often used to say that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said Mark was in compensation of $10 million and Luke with $26 million on his departure.
As Paul said, both Luke and Mark "were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL club's board of directors, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known TV personality and best friend of Colin, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutisova and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded through a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, I have nothing to add to it.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the matter in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a statement in a court, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother's demands.
“Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a successful solution.”
On Friday, all hopes were in sight.
"Our disputes will resolve the trial soon," Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers are fading water and summer clothes.
In the kindergarten Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now running, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and the trees planted do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no pool, but the kids shower in the fog.
In the afternoon, children remain in classrooms where the blinds and overcast curtains are pulled down.
The air is trying to cool with an air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
It's also hard for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is both indoors and outdoors, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have an open operation during this period," said Miloslava Makovičková, the director of the kindergarten.
There is a glazed corridor in the nursery, where, according to her, the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We air in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows will shut up and we have the blinds on the southern sides to protect ourselves.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree there, there is a table under it, and we do different things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the headmistress of the kindergarten.
Teachers try to walk with their children in the woods, where there is a bigger cooler.
Children wet caps and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used for flower spraying, and we use it for showering children," Kompanová said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the headmistress of a kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prague’s Prosek, told the teachers that the teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and sprinkled them with water.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so there are trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose, for example, low-sweet tea or diluted juice, and they have water drinkers in the garden.
Every day they also have vegetable salad and snacks always fresh fruits and vegetables, which sometimes bring them parents.
"Maybe today, a mother brought about a ten-kilo watermelon for children," Makovic added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabins of tram drivers and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
Tram tracks have not yet been seriously damaged by high temperatures.
A slight damage occurred in a loop in Hostivař.
At current high temperatures, we take particular attention to having a sufficient amount of beverages available to drivers.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and depots," Řehková said.
In the fleets and in some inverted places, employees have at their disposal so-called sodas, which produce a chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also take advantage of a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic eliminated 108 of them, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly engaged the fight against the fire.
"The fires in the natural environment and also those associated with harvest work prevail," fire department spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral said.
Even the evening change of weather did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rainfall.
In connection with the thunderstorms, firefighters went to 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoral continues.
However, firefighters were also helped in Stvolínek in the Česká Lípa region, where 60 people from the children's camp evacuated to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures also added work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and night on Wednesday, ambulances went out to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from karma.
Therefore, people should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless gas odorless, which is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, you need to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curtail the president's media diet
Before him, many tried it, and they have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reported that the new chief of staff at the White House plans to curb President Trump's information - including reports on television news - in hopes of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here's a part of the reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly went down on the first day of the new post with employees, outlining the key problem of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or a speech - because the president can make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth at Trump's control and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media is dating back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump was upset by honest reports as a candidate, it was convenient to show him that a lot of other media outlets are talking about him in a positive light that was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri, from Politico, wrote at the time that “a key to keeping Trump’s tweets in rein – at least according to the six former organizers of his campaign – is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that sings praise him.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't controlled.
We will most likely never learn about tweets that Trump has never sentung.
If his employees managed to keep him at least several times at bay, then their efforts did not go to naught.
But no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from insuring controversial topics.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subscribing to the Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, in May published a report on the inclination of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“The current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angerfully to the negative news from the media, especially to reports of leakage of information, and seeks to find its origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February, when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - a website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - who accused Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a 'source of a lot of leaks' from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was forever banished from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already posted false allegations in the past and later called them off.
Trump read the article and began to ask Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that then-Slavic Staff Chief Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “stried to implement the system for managing and documenting the information that President Trump receives.”
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push through the same strategy.
Perhaps it will turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness will not just disappear, and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will certainly aggravate Kelly's mission.
Tourists Negotiate on Trench and Return to ‘Millionaire District’
Several of the wealthiest owners of West Midland, England, are once again embarking on a shaming with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to recapture the field behind their headquarters.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a flourishing street in the town of Solihull, which is nicknamed the 'millionaire's quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. They were not afraid of the ditch, which was duaked on the spot on the basis of the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
A tactical group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with a caravan unprotected gap that served for the journey.
The ragged residents of the neighborhood have attacked the board of directors of the city of Solihull, saying it was 'not capable of solving the problem'.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymously said: 'They took the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
Last night, more arrived and there are probably more of them today.'
She added that: ‘Birmingham Board of Trustees knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to pay taxes until the board of directors settles with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said, “It’s ridiculous. We just recently watched the last departing tourists and now they are back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them.'
Solihull City Council spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of an unauthorised stay on a property near Streetsbrook Road, and in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal action to successfully resolve the problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is imperative that as many local residents as possible report any non-social or illegal behavior to the police at 101.
We will get the overall picture we will deliver in court.'
The wife of the MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special transported the injured Róbert Žitňany to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane was under constant control by Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight was without complications.
According to TV JOJ, Róbert Žitňany had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After transporting his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak MEP Jana Žitňská from the party of NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians harden to fight NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
“If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which significantly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which operates in the first year, declined to comment on the matter on the grounds of the allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
“For us, the number one priority is and always will be to save people’s lives. We are therefore very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the emergency zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on all the current accusations after gathering all the information and assessing the situation.”
Italian authorities have been following the Iuventa ship Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants on a boat, which was handed over directly to the human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting occurred, according to the prosecutor's file, only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescues in the area - of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organization said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable, as they do not constitute any "substantial change or obstacle" in terms of rescue operations.
For example, the organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is a Nobel Prize winner, has also rejected the adoption of a new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, has said that a sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks who land in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to bolster patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperate with local mayors are fruiting.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further negotiations this month with Libya's mayors on the topic of economic development initiatives, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Unshy Mesarošová: Her silicone and cellulite were coming from the overall!
Hot summer days completely attract to it, to take on only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does it the other way around.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where it was just swarming with the stars, presenters, singers and everyone who has something to do with TV Prima, she swarmed her body into a mini jumpsuit.
And it only took a few common movements and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
The overall cut between the halves and coughed so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly had no shortage of attention to the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter sentenced to text messages encouraging Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from the Massachusets was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the involuntary killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life 13. July 2014.
Roy's father told the court on Thursday: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left free until the decision.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood at the scene with tears in her eyes, clasped with her hands, and eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her actions were killed by Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"It has ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"He showed no remorse."
Carter's attorney, however, said it was "unfortunate circumstances that she regrets immensely."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her actions."
The prosecutor reads Roy's statement by Lynn Roy's mother: "One day will not go, so as not to grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever," the statement read.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and never be his children's aunt.
“The loss of a person I’ve been seeing since I was born is a pain I’ll carry with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in force to penalize a person aiding the suicide of another person. This is therefore a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 in a car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published, which incite suicide.
"Maybe you're a victim, jump out of the building, or stabbing yourself, I don't care," read the text messages Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before he was suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it to Conrade” and “Just throw a generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, she was acquitted.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement of the Audi, the BMW manufacturer said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the headquarters of BMW - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would adjust three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel atomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide, which emits diesel engines, is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automakers for the installation of equipment is increased to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for the competitiveness of cars.
While German carmakers are facing careful searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing charges of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars, which reduced the amount of emissions issued during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department at Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore does not apply to extradition, so he can face the trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into the German police on Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emission limits - extending the charges that Audi faces in the US.
Audi’s inclusion in the investigation may have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: luxury car makers a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the girl died.
The accident occurred on Praia de São João Beach in the Costa da Caparica region, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told the SIC Noticias television channel that the plane was flying just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people did not manage to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them escaped alive and police took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the motorways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started construction as early as 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 motorway in Hradec Králové.
The construction of another section of its section has been newly stopped for at least several months by the Children of the Earth movement.
We East Bohemians get the highway by bit, like slicing themselves.
The wheel is cut and then it remains to be seen when and if we get the next one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to reduce the journey time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or Poland from villages and towns.
Endless currents of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not how to drive around.
But the last stretch of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, i.e. an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradec Králové began to be built recently and on other sections to Jaroměř began with an archaeological survey, with the fact that construction will start at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of earplugs in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week, it turned out that it would not be built this year.
And maybe not even next year.
The Children of the Earth-Klub movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed a dissolution.
The children of the Earth repeat their tactics from the D1.
They challenged the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
They shall seek a review of all the binding opinions of all the institutions concerned already issued.
For example, the Hradec Králové municipality, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, we are coming from D11 near the village with the eloquent name of the Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just driving down the highway and suddenly we're standing on the side road and we prefer to then join the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the country.
A terrifying, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth want?
What is the essence of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network practically unfinished in the existing system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the Southeastern France region, but are now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, which causes dismay on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
Gycades and locusts carrying micro-bacteria, which thrive in dry climates, also blame for this."
There are many at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, less."
A possible solution can be more efficient distribution of water and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
Journalist's murder highlights rising threats in Mexico
Riodoce employees meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest taking place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two servic journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and premonitions.
Choose is from what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover criminal conduct.
Violence continues, and bodies pile up across the country; journalists are steadily increasing among them: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrique Pen Niet took power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them also the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence linked to drugs.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is all-pervading - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the middle finger points, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime. The journalists' murderers are very exceptionally at the court.
Riodoca journalists insist that they report on the violence that is happening in Sinaloa; even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the murderers and without the prospect of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time for such meetings," he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, no one can be trusted.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce headquarters in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The gunmen then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
The rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmana's arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields trying to fill the empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of embellished two-story mausoleas for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "ceasefire" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce still reinstates that he did not protect his friend.
He believes two misconducts contributed to his death.
The first was the February release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The conciliation could have angered the sons; suspicious gang members bought all copies of the newspaper as they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers, in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the periodical, Noroeste was practically a veteran when he decided to sell his $50 shares in 2003 and base his shares together with five colleagues Riodoce.
“It was impossible to run journalism in Sinaloa and not to mention the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for the brave and true news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to go on a search for problem topics and published texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for reporting on Latin America.
For the same year, Valdez won the International Freedom of Press award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was afraid for my life,” he said when accepting the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist or play a stupid one.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do face with the face of death... why didn't you say what's going on?'
Riodoce's employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his joke and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and a hug - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine her death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you're entangling yourself with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-densation and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not playing here, hands are gone.
The trouble is, said Riodoce Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, that “smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier.”
According to him, the old rules, as they say, do not apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; a few days ago, a spyware was discovered that governments were buying to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief before the forty-degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect Riodoce's offices, located in a four-story building in the burgher district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are not one of the 50 percent of the law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It's been months since journalists last went to the mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also have it lit up for suspicious government spending that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently, several kidnappings took place in one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the journalists were on the lookout when they were going to write about what every city resident knew: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín's sons "El Chapo" Guzmán escaped the army's intervention unit.
Just a month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly decay the case," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists on the representation of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirezová grabbed several signs and went to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist the following morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacan.
Only a charred body was discovered. Authorities say that on the basis of DNA analysis, it is Adame.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribbling on the sidewalks and buildings of the "SOS press".
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is a day visiting Washington, where he seeks to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, which took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and murdering them for proclaiming the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department out of concern that her anger could jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organized crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public.
In his latest book, “Narco-journalism,” he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
Media surveillance group Articulo 19 has charged police officers and public officials with more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders are clearly working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note reportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to cease operations, such as the El Norte newspaper, based near the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breachová.
Others are still ongoing, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed publicly drug cartels with an article on the front page titled “What Do You Want From Us”?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being chased.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day poses a great risk.
An Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's midnight on Friday, and Riodoce's staff sit on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest release sent to the printer - drinking beer when a phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area promised by members of the syndicate.
Journalists are posting this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline changes again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez casts a glimpse of the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquirous slogan for the whole of Sinaloa - all Riodoce employees follow his steps.
"How could we just think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when a one internist asked me to take me to the streets on the same day when Javier was killed?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now revealed the findings of the first findings of an amazing rhino-like creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which the experts called 'Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur' - found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and said the dinosaur had a 'problem past'.
An article in the journal Current Biology reported that it was the 'most preserved armored dinosaur found so far and one of the best dinosaur species in the world'.
Petty is a new kind of family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described him with the words 'really remarkable'.
According to National Geographic, the armored birch-grandfaper is still the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who uncovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 during drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was shipped to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“All you have to do is squint a little and you will believe that he is asleep,” said the head of work Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
“I’m sure he’ll go down in history as one of the most beautiful and survived dinosaur species – the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank - most likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many animals today.
Experts say it allowed him to merge better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests it was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110-million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealoppelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and shape of the scales and armor throughout the body.
They revealed the method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopleta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred to camouflage to confrontation in survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - for example, deer, zebra or shingle - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaur had to literally fight for its outgoing.
“The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by predators in the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in scales also revealed that dinosaur skins had a reddish-brown coloration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more knowledge of his life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to track down his last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into a river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sanched to the bottom.
In the Alberta region at that time, the same climate was as in present-day Florida, and rivers, and the oceans stretched much further into the inland than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and is preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as in the time of chalk.
You don’t have to use your imagination to renovate it; you just need to squint a little and it seems like he’s just asleep.”
In the Cretaceous period, huge terrobodies, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking on the Earth, walking on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived for several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey to his equally gruesome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, the latest findings published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelt was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is additionally complete from snout to hips.
The animal was on average 5 meters long and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm spines protrud from his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore has sailed the territory of present-day Canada until he ended up in a river that washed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “Filling an individual in this way can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch it, the shocking the find I find.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that armored plates around the skull still cover the remnants of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did an activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the native of St. Louis sat on the bed in the Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a secondary school student's contribution.
“Police have just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street,” he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her wall posts.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying limply on the street, from where no one took it even after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
Death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to come back to him in the evening, watching tweets about people who were gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched photos of police tapes and roaring people. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign in his hand with the inscription "The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched live news - one of the policemen stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and at the other end of the barking dog.
In another video, another police officer said held a gun in his hand with which he was aiming at the crowd and yelling, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've gotten used to and that we can call normal.
I could feel goosebumps all over my body.
"I was angry and I cried."
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years describes a new documentary "Whose Streets?" that will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and resilience told from the perspective of people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience of blacks."
"Remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police have killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It wasn't possible that I wouldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the climax... that has occurred in the past.
She must have known and see with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different layers of experience with black people, and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Despite being able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own, she does not differ in any way from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would just hurt her."
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was the South Florissant Road opposite the police department, which became the base of activists, which awaited the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for the others.
Together they prepared food for the bags and helped distribute it to the Protestants.
A new type of activism began to be slowly being born in Ferrello's eyes.
“My activism has been turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. Association and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" ongoing events.
Ferrell, however, thought: "Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people who wanted to make money from pain and decisiveness.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We have heard that the voices of people born and grow up in Ferguson are very often neglected and that we wanted to change.”
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the theme of prisoners on death row.
His participation in the project was also involved in Ferrell and with six other locals, who were followed by the team "Whose Streets?" in the years following the assassination of Brown.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented by me."
While the document's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to portray that the movement "is not about the savior leader, but about the community rapprochement," Folayan said - it turned out to be the most open to participation in filming.
The documentary “Whose Streets?” thus describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the first time she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and humanise black people, I had to open myself."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created a campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in 2012 on social media in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin on social media - call themselves weirdo.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind the preservation of the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must endure the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "a movement is actually supported by black women and a great bunch of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that “this is not a mere affirmative affair” and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the one who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she was on the front lines is not a coincidence, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the rush of energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial bonds between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving two and a half years probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area she calls home described as "Frighten."
Yet she has remained in her efforts, to which she has committed herself since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains.”
There was a field in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter also helped.
Near Český Brod in the Kolín region, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of approximately 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firefighters declared the third stage of the fire alarm from four possible.
According to fire department spokesman Ladislav Holomcic, the fire also helped to extinguish the helicopter from the air.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage worth 700000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters were fighting the flames on the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the harvester.
The helicopter also helped extinguish, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed over to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 a.m. he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblinglance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is placed several faces of different skin tones - white, black and snite - suspended from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them seemed to fall out of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the swabs of the oral and hairs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorised publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which started on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemmblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transgender and pioneering dissident whose punishment was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the post of President of the United States.
The Algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person would look like with this genotype, was created by Dewey-Hagborg's sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the plylessness of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty indictments, including violating six spy laws, cyber fraud and theft.
All her photos were detained by the prison staff. Only one black-and-white photograph of lower quality has been leaked to the public, at which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wit, with which she is now associated.
In 2015, there was still a positive reaction to the 2012 Stranger Visions Dewey-Hagborg project.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were preparing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait,” Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, neither the visits nor the photographing were allowed, so they contacted Chelsea asking if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the release of the comic, President Obama asked for Manning’s release, a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a Kansas military prison.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is underway at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people seeking to disclose government information and transgender soldiers while trying to look for new ways to incite his tweets with his tweets the resentment in the areas he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that "everything is happening for some reason."
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter “i” in the surname is tapped with heart) after the end of the “self-acting faction, which is based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite side there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centied letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
By incorporating 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"I hope that people will take it away, that our genome doesn't care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said. You can also see her work Spurious Memories from 2007 on the topic of video.
“DNA tells many different stories, these are 30 of them.”
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above-mentioned graphic novel.
He shows Manning, who emerges in the manner of King Kong from the United States Disillinary Barracks Prison, with a megaphone in his hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win," it reads.
“Never be silenced.”
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, my skin is mopping."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - which was predicted in the comics - but when that happens, she will be greeted in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic effigies, lined as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm high Maning statue, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
"They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to radiate the feeling of a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and frees it.”
Northwest University Professor and Oxford University Employee Search for Murder
There is a nationwide search for a professor of the University of Northwestern and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man who was found to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
A first-degree murder warrant was issued on Monday for a man named Wyndham Lathe (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for allegedly taking part in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports Cook County.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police say the deceased's body was found 27. July.
Police were notified of this fact by phone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau has been declared dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a murder. Police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology of the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University of Public Relations, said in his e-mail statement that Lathe is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities, and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said in a statement.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in a statement by email: "We were contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the U.S. police as well."
The statement also says that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and wish to come forward to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of contact with the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down the suspects are escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in the apartment no. 1008.
Police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on 27. July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza has issued a statement to all residents: "The police are now working to compile a time overview and profile of the victim and investigate various motives, including domestic violence."
'We'll complete the WADA plan in the near future' - Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the reinventing Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and testing in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan aimed at complying with the code - which describes the criteria for reinstating the RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that Russia should be concerned.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren, about alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes' doping by the government.
On this subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutka's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely unreservedly," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSAD of taking out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "on the right track" to restrain.
Police have charged three people, one of them a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with the establishment of Wednesday's fire of a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in the Frýdek-Místek region.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the crime of general endangerment.
The Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"This is a very fresh thing and the police are currently working on the motive for the matter," Kužel said.
He said the police would discuss the possible take-up of the accused into custody.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say any more yet, because the criminal police and investigation services workers are actually working on the matter, and the prosecutor who is supervising the matter," Kužel said.
The wooden church of the body of God in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will go into tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was reconstructed.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, additional costs are ready to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, the public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is also being prepared.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire fifteen years ago.
It was caused by a fault in the wiring.
An exact copy was then created in its place.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
He'll support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state counts.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been tasked with its processing by the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is according to the proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on the support of the military capacity.
The basic objective of the proposal, according to its authors, is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of military duty and on the basis of voluntary nature.
For example, the state would, for example, support the associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get data on people who are willing to come to the country in a time of crisis to help and their capabilities or material equipment if necessary.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help the associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It also includes organizing discussions with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after the declaration of the state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the intent said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic goal of the intention is to create a very broad base that will allow every citizen to respond to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to improper behavior not to impede the performance of tasks to the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the intention states.
Adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
Additional money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also presupposes that the scope of regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which together would employ another 42 soldiers.
Representatives of the ministry have previously said that the law should also help resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters to be part of the system to keep some weapons that the directive is forbiding.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but she did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even deceptive.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based e-commerce company, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New human resource start-ups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow startups to make quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer total employee anonymity and a hot complaint line, and in some cases also allow informers to bypass superiors and contact the directors directly.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Reedwood City startup.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness in three years about what her employees think and feel.
In addition to the rapid surveys and the voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realise that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - that is torn in scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and complicity industry may exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The launcher of Denver, Colorado, a Convercent launcher that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, has seen a small increase in interest and activity in the early year, just before Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 Convercent clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently adopted under its wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “lightning” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The Court of Public Opinion has mandated regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive director of the startup Convercent.
If the company is convicted of mishandling its employees or unethical behavior - and if regulators do not intervene - it may face costly consequences as a result of boycotting customers, employee depletion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25 000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of corporate policies and procedures, and ensuring an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to trace the phone number or e-mail to the company management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, deputy general of Ruby Tuesday, saying there was no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it is ensured to quickly detect and resolve problems that have never previously reached managers sitting in offices far away from real complaint resolution - for example discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's approaching a holistic, overall view of the employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday overseeing risk management.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from legal disputes by employees.”
The companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees lightly in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after the collapse of Enron in the matter of the misuse of employee ethics, Quinlan said.
But it was only when social media shined on the whole thing,” society began to realize that in the online world they could simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
“Earlier, before people started using technology to monitor the ethics of technology, they relied on faith,” Quinlan said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by the courageous capital investors, supported by both startups.
As part of its February campaign, Convercent collected $10 million in a total of $10 million as part of its February campaign, eventually taking $47 million into a capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of societies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets, such as, for example. Silicon Valley, the main advantages are not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they perceive that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are aspiring to the company’s success,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if companies are doing well and companies are thriving if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure the engagement and commitment of employees to the company, it is no wonder that there will be a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to the experts in the work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company asks for feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case ever - can provoke disappointment and lack of interest to employees.
"Once you ask 4000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consultancy at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies that relied on the data.
“Because once you don’t get things done, the employees start asking the question, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should it be of interest to me? '
Madison Reed, which is now regularly conducting a survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully resolve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important insight into its employees and hopes that in the long run it will achieve high employment in the industry, which is known for frequent layoffs.
“If you’re not trying to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt.”
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, not many temperature records were set compared to Tuesday on Thursday.
The heat was mainly affected by Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or offset to 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded the record.
In Strážnice, for example, today's temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region today, 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four-tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice in the Brno region the current 37.1 grades exceeded the record by three-tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the largest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, in Western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, today's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius today.
"The temperatures there started to grow only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the CHM, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and more rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've grown up with this kind of bad shit.
Billionaires are not the same vote in elections as every single person in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as impusionsable as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejšek’s Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The convicted corruptor and the king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, bought a Party to private individuals.
The political movement Agrofert, as the Mayor of Kroměříž, Jaroslav Němec, called the project of Andrej Babiš, is a chapter in itself.
The Mayors have also recently caught their billionaire.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the Jablotron security equipment company.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the carpentry jersey, however, did not succeed Dědek very well.
"I've never set small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the ANO movement to get twenty percent in the elections.
Some people smiled.
But the Grandfather's dispensing is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of firm opinions.
Although he intends to apply for the votes of voters in the Mayors’ jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
Grandfather supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule the attractive rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
He is not going into politics because he wants to improve personally.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world, which is under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration to Babiš again.
And he said that he wanted the Mayors to learn to imagine the possible cooperation with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that Dědek does not change his opinions and stands for himself no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so clumsy to Build His B to the Mayors.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron, for example, did not break up badly with the head of Agrofert in the store and is looking for a different way to defend his business rival.
However, Dědek’s first public appearances were not just around Babiš.
Dědek promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone tossing a statement like this.
After all, the court-appointed thug Zdeněk Bakala was throwing away millions in all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats came together to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids anyone giving a political party more than three million.
When Grandpa enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then he wouldn’t have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
Dědek crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage of families with studied children.
People with higher education come to us about fifty thousand per month.
Those with the basic ones in less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in this situation.
The one with twenty poor.
In Dědek’s vision of society, the poor honestly pay taxes, and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, which they do not participate in much.
Rich people simply need to be helped not to suffer from poverty with an emergency.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš rub their hands.
Thanks to Dědek, the rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have their own members or citizens of the state for their own employees and country for their own property.
And finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by $234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often even 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by U.S. President Donald Trump.
In the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible £8million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochard says about the plot: "Such, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to the place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the U.S. president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by an incredible £8million.
The original price of the property was £1.5 million, the final price fell to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands as 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And it's no wonder.
The breathtaking mansion with an area of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palms are planted on the property.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price reflected the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15m.
He was to buy the property for the rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With the new price, it ranks second.
The property was recognised at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to put an end to two workouts a day. There are long days for the Bruins
The 11th morning is approaching, and UCLA's American football players are squeezing at the side line of the new school playground.
Some of them undress their jerseys and reveal sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most team members of this few minutes of doing nothing, the midday break is substituted.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place on the upcoming morning at 6:30 a.m.
“There will be a big job for these guys for these three days,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday swelled on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled for 19:15 - to squeeze into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons spent Mora as a coach at Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year, and training sessions are limited for the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day also has its influence on this.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled until August 20, whereupon formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September, begin.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to the already charged gamer diary.
"Thirty or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.
UCLA will be closed after the training camp, which will not be easy to look at the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goal bar.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“The safety is taken care of, but it is not impossible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security guards, as well as parking lot no. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will turn out well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook plans more thorough checks of facts to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under the original posts in an effort to fight the so-called "fake news," the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the results of the survey under the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election of the president of the United States.
There are political debates in Europe about the matter. French voters are flooded with an avalanche of fake news of the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if they do not urgently remove anger posts.
Facebook said in a further statement in Germany on Thursday that it is preparing to launch testing a new feature of checking fake news in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people ask more content to be better informed and can make the right decision about what they can share,” said Sara Su, Facebook’s product news executive.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotty Castle recently played a major role in the music video clip of Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher found her refuge in the 70's and 80's of the last century.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy place by the Bewl River in Kent, UK, inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of the County - a well-known penchant for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
“The sight of the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of families who lived in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages until the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it’s not Rhodes’s first book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library’s documentaries – a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on the letter written by a double agent in the 70's who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I can smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I Love the Archives!”
For someone so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the ability to dwell in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. “To tell you the truth, I extended my stay a little.”)
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, walking archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that had been thrown in the ditch for centuries.
He walked on the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked to the hajné, gardeners and, sometimes, with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night he "drink whiskey and wrote".
The confidant history of Scotney is a relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the employees were just beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words, as when “aristocrats scatter many centuries with their hands with the words: ‘Take it to the attic.’
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think the dispute over the land is boring," Rhodes said, "but I've come across one case where two families were fighting over birch.
Let the people go!”
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and sink deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1881 Anglice Uprising.
"I found a record of a rebellion in a castle from 1380, which was in the book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area and it occurred to me that the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they’re in the end of the question.”
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was not discovered until a few years later after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is Darrell's: "I was intrigued by the male generation - the men of the time were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by taking the wealthy or old ladies - I imagine it was handsome gentlemen who liked to piss the heads of the heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week st in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was swallowed up by nature.
But it's a strange place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
“I thought, ‘Now to get to the hell into real life.’”
Washington changes conditions for granting a green card
The media has released President Donald Trump's words about the U.S.'s new immigration plan, which will also include a change in granting a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 year-on-year due to stricter rules on temporary visas and limiting family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will achieve this by changing the rules of issuing green cards to the people of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritise English-speaking applicants who abound in funds and will prove the capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted by the media, said in a statement.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when 2017 seemed to be a bizarre year, there was a report on the technological development of sex robots on the Internet.
Yes.
Sex drives are popular at the moment.
Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former robotics and artificial intelligence professor at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look at the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose eye color, nipples shape and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Shawhite said.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course there is artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "edit" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
But it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame even Stepford’s owner.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement wife various character traits, among them shyness.
And then there is the sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "frigid Farrah," characterized by a shy nature and a "wild Wendy" with an "adventure" nature.
“Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” reads the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative or be “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - including confusion for real interpersonal relationships. Worrying are rather inferior female character traits and violent innuendo - e.g. frigid (readingering) Farrah.
True Companion on its website likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man Roxxxy?" the page reads.
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetish or sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - the expulsion from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for captivated sex with an optional surcharge.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain at the edge of interest of the general public.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by the present modern era.
And most people are not weird or violent until they get a coat of excuse for free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining rights and a president sits in the White House, who often expresses himself very perversely to the woman.
The most terrible aspect of the series The Handman's Tale is not what we see - hanged bodies and scoundled eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The book The Handman's Tale represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should as much as resemble real women (even with porn actress rates).
Their creators construct them in such a way that they are pleasant to the touch and at first glance act as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their “personality,” a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history. Nothing that would incite their independence or disturb their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The 21st Century Speech: Servants.
NBA star on the green chant.
Curry is fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry has not lost himself despite a botched first shot at the premiere start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA winner played the lower-season of the Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, the first round of 74 rounds at the Ellie Mae Classic tournament and will fight for the cut.
Golden State, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started a lot nervously and his first shot ended up in a cup holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a score of four shots over par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, they had to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it sat down a bit," Curry said, adding that he had a huge fright.
It was very nervous, to blow the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to fight his way through the cut, which is likely to be set by two strokes under par, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've got rid of the stage fright, I hope it goes," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time at a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in the Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against this, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense
The unmistakable feature of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, also break entire families.
In the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, it was swarming in American newspapers with advice on how to deal with relatives who vote for Trump.
We're supposed to be waiting for us to let us in.
But less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to cement the family.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin - a poet and a fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has been paying for a Republican fool in our family for a long time, visited me in New York City.
She reminded me that a lot in the face of a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family is suddenly - including all the Republican siblings she has hanged on politics for years - on one wavelength.
At dinner at the family table, this is a good thing; but it strikes me that in a broader context, this poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the terrifying possibility that his clowns may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the pre-league Republicans, who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy behavior - the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we had an awareness of his tax return) - both examples of which look like very slight offense compared to Trump.
After the departure of Trump, it is enough to make the subsequent Republican candidate at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the largest merry-go-round operated by the New York Parks department - you won't find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and in horror look at their own shoulders - a completely bleak look and clinking music, oddly reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama is perched, instead of breathing on you through the atmosphere, and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still did not get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - not counting the thematic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a metro station in London.
However, the merry-go-round in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will have a great time on it.
If I could evaluate the merry-go-round, it would deserve the maximum of points. Fortunately, no one asks.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to pay by credit card to evaluate my “experience” on a scale of one to five.
In the cafe on the corner of my street, it's the same, except I can bid a 15% tip for something I buy at the counter.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to rub herself into the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my five-star credit card transmission.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to hospital.
Last year he was treated for cuttings on his wrist, which he did himself after falling in a cell, according to the prison.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original verdict for manslaughter.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of the morning on Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet closet at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
The prosecutors announced their intention to re-eliminate, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the court will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces an extension of the sentence of up to 15 years.
In South Africa, the death penalty does not apply.
For the first time in history, a bred panda gave birth to a young captive that was in the wilderness.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas bred in captivity.
A Zhang Zhchung city manager told the New China news agency that pande farming is at a major risk of kinship crossing.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
Trying to let the captured pandas mate with the wild ones is thus the first step to prevent panda breeding from helping protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cchao-chao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda-mining period on March 11.
Thanks to the surveillance device on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
She met her chosen Choo-chao 12 days later.
Sexual contact with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and turned out successfully.
This, too, can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite miscalculate the time when the female is ready, moreover, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The young was born healthy and, even as Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during her pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after childbirth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on August 1 in the morning by the Sithonian police.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will be held all season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilkova is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open major.
The pitch in Kingsbarns, Scotland, went one under par with the score, playing three birdies and two bogeys.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that she will pass the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entry into the $3.25 million subsidy competition was best American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the play record of 64 rounds, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which says 80 percent of eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only a limited number of egg types recognizable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in the eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but the potential threat is for children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for the Czech JRC, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also proceeded to close farms, have not recently been imported into the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where the markets of which have found problem signs of insecticide.
According to the veterinary administration, the eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and the last time eggs from the Netherlands were in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of fleas, everything and ticks.
However, animals whose meat is consumed by humans should not be given.
The WHO considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten years.
"Perhaps I will go back there one day," smiled the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement until the start of the new year.
How were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as in school, I'd be three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was learning.
The next year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But during the opening ten games we only scored five points, so the coaches started filming it.
At the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's the way it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're going to get married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is the KHL for the goalkeeper?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more at the back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem at the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play into the empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Did you have a problem with traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, it’s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done in such a bit that you play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians even perceive their KHL club?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it's a national sport.
Everyone is rooting for.
Even though it didn't work out, a lot of people were walking.
Did Dinamo's work in the KHL help that Latvia almost advanced to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there from the beginning.
And since the same time, their results at the World Cup have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an unbelievable result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts made his way in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is signed.
Why do so many of them come here?
They're not B players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without engagement?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't continue Riga.
That's why we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I train at home in Zlín and wait for something to appear.
Are you nervous about this?
I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How realistic is the option that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where what comes out.
Now I can only wait to see what the agent says.
Do you prefer a competition?
The past season wasn't enough to be able to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's Fullow at Let continues.
In January of this year, in an article With the Care of a Proper Manager?, I also wrote about the camp in Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to remind myself of the main passages of the article.
The Lety camp has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look, for example, on the official website of the cultural monument Remembrance instead of Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8. 8. 1940 served as a labor camp, from 1. 1. 1942 was a collection camp and from 2. 8. 1942 became a Gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first Lety's prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
Day 4. 5. 1943 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense hardships of human beings, which in turn have caused them human beings and perverted ideologies.
There is no doubt that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
There is no dispute that this reminder should take place at the memorial at the site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somehow somewhat forgotten, and in the 70's of the 20th century, a pig farm was built nearby and on a part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled at Lety.
In the mid-90's of the 20th century, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far this has not happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So much very briefly the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It wasn't until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably obstruct those intentions if I went public with them."
We will see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it could be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Anyway, it's not going to be a cheap thing.
And yet, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a memorial, in the modifications the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not imminent, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Does the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of commemoration, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy and anyone who wants to, can bow to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place of remembrance with the utmost care.
The entrusted assets, including taxpayers’ money, should be treated by the responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper manager.
At least with the same as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above-mentioned facts, I perceive the slogan of the ANO leader only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, groomed parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exposition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitee with seating and a view of its own remembrance site, which is made of stones located in a slight slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be wise to consider whether it would be possible, for example. part of the uncovered foundations to be able to make it possible and at least visually make available in an appropriate manner.
In this direction, Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could stretch his efforts.
In the event that he succeeds in pushing through the government to buy the pig farm for state money, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already problematic work as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
An incurable disease, affecting up to 1.3 million U.S. people and 300 000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded of not incipient meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, University researchers at Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Head of study dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt sided with inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of a mouse with a specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote the body's tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same goes for a human, then the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich-rich diet would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Graduate researcher dr. As part of studying a certain type of immune cells supporting the body’s tolerance, Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice was missing cells.
She deduced from the fact that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse intestines were tested by the DNA alignment method, and researchers found six kinds of bacteria in mics with immune cells, which were lacking in the second group of mics.
The mice that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome - so they did not develop this kind of immune cells - the bacterium L. reuteri - and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophanous metabolism known as indoll-yestic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, after the dose of tryptophan, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep the bacteria L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if tryptophane byproducts from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes related to tryptophan were detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammatoryness of the inner bowel.
The potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the population of cells."
Jose Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanj Matić and transfer to Manchester United as 'genius'
Manchester United have acquired the "genia" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matic, who signed a £40million contract, said in the first game with a 2:1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match ahead of the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in their role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team pre-season Asian tour, Matic did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We will help him to get in shape as soon as possible.”
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to shape his eleven for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists the club has done a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players into the team.
“Thank you to the club for helping me get three of the four players,” he added.
“Four out of four would make me more happy, but I admit they did their best for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken cuticles, Lada Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promising picture began to emerge thanks to the new program on TV Prima Zdeněk Academy.
The peanut immediately swept the chance.
"Laughter Zdeněk, I would like to join your cooking academy with this, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a social media video.
And because the two have been peaking for several years, Láďa did not forget to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from diet chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you for water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Pear said.
He is really serious about his participation in Pohlreichov's new show.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's up to the boss," he told Blesku.
But Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hruška’s participation in the culinary academy, saying that he takes the whole thing as his personal activity, which goes off-to-date.
A big blow was dealt by Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
Over 300 thousand units were sold in a few days!
The new show, presented yesterday by Prima at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from the audience and in twelve works he introduces them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014, Zdeněk had his neck spilled an outspoke on his back.
If he had my face there, I'd have a lot of laughs.
"I just smile over that pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Láďa responded.
He thinks of Láďa’s culinary art.
"Draining according to Lada Hruška is not an option at home, because I will not let home gastropunk," the boss is clear.
I appreciate Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, even according to him I do chicken for honey.
In my show, however, his recipes will definitely not appear," Pear refused.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or an asshole," Pohlreich said of Hruška at a lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't care about them anymore," Hruška said at the expense of the utter insults.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and house with a wave
The British inventor became the first man in the country with a microchip put into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start a car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
The procedure of implantation and adherence to treatment procedures is supervised by dr. Geoff Watson, anesitisologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted with dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers a service to replace door and car locks with a microchip. The price of one castle is £300.
The married father of one child has integrated the technology into his house and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House's decision to fly with the Navy helicopter to South Lawn to mark the U.S. manufacturing industry celebration last month came at $24, according to the Navy's records issued by the weekly TIME.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the program of 17. July at the White House, which was a parade of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed a product show of 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was displayed alongside a Yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forkliftlift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and asked for the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the administration of the helicopter said.
"I wanted to make sure that you have an awareness of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, a representative of the aviation navy commander the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn 17. July approximately at 7:00 on the occasion of the parade, the start of which is scheduled for 15:00 and will remain in place until the entire site was completely evacuated, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The email further stated that if there was a delay on departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight due to working hours.
The original crew remained in place that evening along with the helicopter, and with them a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by the weekly TIME - it was not apparent whether the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prevents civil servants from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're blocked," the deputy commander wrote.
This "Made in America" parade was marked by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the president advocated a medical reform that passed through the Senate and spoke of an effort to keep government regulations at bay.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered control in February after the presidential plane was driving in the background at his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which introduced products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a representative of the press secretary.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn region, reticing potential arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the crew's current training session, the state official said.
The helicopter unit flew another eleven hours as part of “non-Presidential Support Missions” on the same day.
The White House said no additional props were covered by taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in any way in negotiations to expose the helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep the records of the presidential flight budget, and the exact costs related to the parade are, according to the Navy, difficult to determine.
According to the Defense Department, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, DoD's refunds on VH-3D 24,380 dollars per flight hour.
Records of the unit indicate a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"Indicating the costs of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual cost."
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD’s reimbursement does not include staff costs, but include fuel prices, maintenance and contractual costs.
The White House press secretary of the Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
"The idea of the parade that takes place this week is to introduce products made in the U.S.," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state, and that they provide the work of hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities, the production of which is involved in countless American citizens.
This is to be remembered.”
It is unclear if Trump, during his roundabout on South Lawn, also looked at the helicopter. It is certain that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three of them himself."
A young woman stranded in a swamp near Macha Lake, police were married to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about two o'clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the marshes.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help with a mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"So far, police officers soon lost their contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols set out to see the place she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt firm ground again under their feet," Baláková said.
And so was the missing.
Police officers oriented themselves according to the direction of her call for help.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman only at quarter to five in the swamps in the locality of Borný.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength, and there were signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called her was taken to a hospital in Česká Lípa.
The connection between the Grandfeigan and STAN?
The bride-to-be is becoming a selling girl.
That's a bit of irony.
With his web project, the viewnamemslusny.cz seems to be a billionaire basically telling voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And he also confirmed that a politically disparate bunch of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national agenda for the parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with Grandfather, whatever political opinion he has.
Once this way Vít Bárta started and it didn’t work out very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which even Gazdík admitted, is also disturbed by the popular argument of the head of the STAN, that the greatest value of the movement is precisely politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to polls.
They can now easily replace the well-collected unknown personalities.
Gazdík explained the total break-up with the People's Party, after which the STAN changed the logo and slogan, by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the People's Party.
But if STAN suspected few of their identity at that time, after the arrival of Dědek, the mere identity game ends.
Not only Gazdík has long opposed Andrej Babiš ANO, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My goal is for the ANO movement, i.e. the Mayors movement, the Mayors movement, will get twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't mistake the movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics similarly to Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
The STAN has been more reminiscent of a reality show than a real political party for some time, and Dědek's helping hand seems to make the bride even more a sell-out girl.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People's Party and now for a change he is looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police dogs trained in Most overflight by helicopter
Dogs specialized in searching explosives and search dogs today re-exerted at Lake Most by helicopter overflight.
The police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region, Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both adults trained trained dogs and those who are just undergoing training.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were supposed to detect sharp samples of explosives in the vicinity of the lake and search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So that immediately the helicopter gets, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"A helicopter gets down, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tommy said.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately on the way by helicopter is eliminated from the training.
"Mostly they are left by dog handlers, for example, in the garden," Tommy added.
The police have 76 dogs in the Ústí nad Labem region with various specializations.
German shepherds are predominant, but there are also more Belgian shepherds.
The handler takes care of him from the puppy.
"He educates him himself, prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can detect possible medical disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and unfageted, it passes the first exams at 20 months.
"He is getting into a sharp intervention around two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of the police service depends on the health of the dog.
It usually serves up to eight to ten years.
They usually live in their handlers.
Round 3 trailer for Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix's hit franchise
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is revealed, Netflix's series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already been confirmed for the third and fourth seasons - the former has already received the first trailer and an outminate of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA will focus on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the guidance of four influential godfathers, they operate "like a company from the Fortune 500" only, with the difference that they are easing acts of violence and bribing more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orijuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orijuela (Franco Denis) plays the brain of the surge, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote).
Pedro Pascal returns in the new trailer as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian rights enforcers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Newvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will make its premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan Democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, are taking part in them, a representative of the UN in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, senior official of the United Nations Auxiliary Mission, said hundreds of women are taking part in the election to local councils, three women are applying for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and trustworthy only if women, as well as all related processes related to the election, take part in them.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on April 5.
The Taliban has released several threats against the electoral process, which is shifting international combat activities to the other side.
In this year’s elections, for the first time, one democratically elected government passes on its power to the following government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission said of the total 3.6 million registered voters make up 1.2 million women.
The unique brewery brews beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to life a few years ago the brewery in Lobč u Mšena.
The brewery, commemorated for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted into a steam engine operation in the 19th century.
It was followed by years of heyday, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during the Second World War, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantsed into building material.
In 2007, however, there was a new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have been carefully engaged and devoted to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery takes the same form as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era started.
Their work was awarded by the brewery's declaration of a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building also became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they also ceremonially renewed the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínsko, visit the bar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use kokořín water springing in the protected landscape area, malt from the Lobec fields and Žatec hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional pale lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss a tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and half past two.
The largest artillery fortress of Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest strengths of its type worldwide?
Such a unique building was supposed to be the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babi.
It was originally supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected to the vast underground.
Here should be the headquarters, the barracks, the warehouses of ammunition, material, the power plant, the engine room and the hospital.
The construction was ended by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who in the early 1990s began to reconstruct the unique building, you can also visit here.
The underground is already 75 percent available!
In addition to the infantry cabin T-S 73 with an exhibition and underground, there is also an armed building of light fortifications, two built-up infantry log cabins, trenches and the Natuné Trutnovsko nature trail.
Refreshments, cosy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been placed on a list alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Traian harbour near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of the massive four-winged building of the convent over the beautiful garden.
The list he got to, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are at risk of extinction.
Enthusiasts, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year of the Evening for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where they will perform, among others. Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of a beautiful large building that are usually inaccessible.
But most importantly, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look the Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno attracts an unusual excursion into the deepest prehistory to the Stone Age, the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how Neanderthals were able to perfectly cope with all sorts of extreme climatic conditions, especially with the alternation of ice ages and inter-ice-ice periods.
Despite their simple material culture, the predators of their time were extremely successful.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting skills were, but also their aesthetic sensibilities.
Wouldn't you say that to the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival takes place on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music, you will see the building of a Celtic village, you will try the Celtic way of life, including crafts, games for children and adults, divination, magic or ritual painting on the body.
There will be La Quadrilla with Irish and Scottish dances, drumming, bagpipe game and amazing fire surprise performed by Carpe Noct.
What does Moravian-Silesian like taste?
The seventh year of the well-known gastrofestival How Šmaks is Moravian-Silesian takes place on Saturday, August 5, 2017 in the area of the mountain spa Karlova Studánka.
Chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, you will taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theater, bottling castle, Smurf competition path and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl@ntNet will help students with the creation of herbariums and ordinary plant lovers.
When they are interested in what plant they have just come across a walk, this application will advise them.
All they will have to do is photograph the plant, and the app itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for both iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Ethical and Environmental Education Center in Bratislava’s Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were also involved in the project, who photographed with teachers in the database of the application and added plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French app is free to download on the website The Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, and thus increase the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Already children who can keep a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which then assigns it under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcomed that users after opening the account to the application contribute to the application by a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will evaluate if it is beneficial, and then they will add it to the database," Poláčková said.
GMB's Concerns About Investing in the McVitie's Factory in Glasgow
The unions are demanding assurances from the managers of the biscuit maker McVitie's about the long-term commitment of production at the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent for the time being about a possible investment in the Tollcross factory.
There are more than 500 employees working in the factory, who, among other products, also make Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, the company Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the area in the past few years.
She added that the employees and representatives of the unions would be "among the first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's construction manager, the Scottish GMB union expressed their concerns that McVitie's "will not get their promises to fund and upgrade production lines."
GMB’s chief organizer, Drew Duffy, added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the construction manager regarding the company’s needs and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and Glasgow, where work at the factory here represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the point of view of work, salaries and benefits - and despite the outlook for Brexit, the rising cost of living and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The Tollcross construction manager received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we value the continued commitment to the union's employees and representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives of GMB in Tollcross was held two months ago, and at this meeting, many problems were openly talked about.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully for others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £5 million in Tollcross, especially in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the locality, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the local factory, the employees and representatives of the unions will be immediately informed."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of moving Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar on its side after she paid £189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of his contract, but has the French team warned Barcelona about their record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred the waters of summer transfers. The Ligue 1 club is ready to beat more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, who paid £89m for it last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and at the same time the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive £500 000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is indignant with the way Neymar has withdrawn from his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival at Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted this fact to the president of PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll certainly reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona appears to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would it allow the Italian representative to leave. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its presumptuous negotiations with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly comprehensible rules?
Donald Trump has agreed to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing about North Korea’s threat and that it would not go on like this.
This also causes the thought of sanctions like straw from shoes.
These things can't be thrown into one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela really set off on a journey to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not just acting as much as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to summarise it all in such a way that even an ordinary voter, American, European or other, understand what it is and what system of rules it is based on the policy of sanctions, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only tightening up what President Obama has already prepared, only giving it an Implementing stamp.
So why such a commotion?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US election, he and Putin would take a call and lift sanctions.
Terorish notion.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, but they tighten.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
The same as that kosher is just the sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither kosher nor the EU's anti-Russian sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
That's just that sanctions are to be used so weak that they don't endanger anyone?
The ordinary voter is groped.
He has heard for three years that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he learns that this is the EU's energy security.
The voter is also more distant.
Sanctions are coming to Russia for being too much assembling where it should not.
China is being scolded for being assembled little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All those punishments, or just consideration, have their rationality.
But does anyone see this as a system, order, or rules?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš has married, crisscrosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the electoral program.
Apart from the Pardubice Region, it has already completed all the candidates.
He said he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian governor and shadow education minister, ANO, Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor," Babis confirmed his earlier position.
You have upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and towns themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect a president directly, and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about the repeal of the representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When presenting your book What I Dream of When I happen to sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of councils.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and reducing the number of representatives.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is accused of building enough and not preparing big projects, but she doesn't have the competence for it.
The same is true of the government, which in our history was managed by only two people, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say that they did it well.
But the current prime minister is not driving anything, he is just moderating the debate.
That's not how it can work.
Is that why you want to promote a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to make it.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate of ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are supposed to work mainly in commissions and committees, not to show off at meetings of the Chamber of Deputies.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
That’s what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, to control the House with 101 deputies, you will abolish the regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will take over the whole country.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
French President Macron announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57 thousand French nationals per legislate, while in our country it costs 17 thousand Czechs.
Macron, however, is accused of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the majority election, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making some dramatic changes.
But the seductions for the one who has a parliamentary majority are large, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team that will work for the people in government, not for their parties or departments.
I don’t understand why we couldn’t agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services would increase.
Why did they overruler me and add 21 percent of GIBS members who are already taking 60 thousand?
Would you like to do that as prime minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers are behaving uneconomically, confusing the government with a travel agency, and with the state money, they would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government, they are supposed to talk about the contradictions outside of it.
The finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition ruptures, a power vote and business, there it is to be decided.
How do you want a cohesive team to behave mainly in a party manner?
There is a constitutional law over the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement does not apply, and he fired Babis from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control abilities, he does not need such wild gestures.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to the Secretary of the Treasury?
I don't think about it at all, we probably won't even be in the government, no one wants to work with us, although I don't know what I've done so bad.
So much skeptosis is not appropriate.
The mayors have been acquired by entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, the wing of Jiří Čunek may win the wing of the inclined to you.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out the coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus Jr. may be in the ODS, who will not oppose it.
I'd leave it up to the electorate.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with the SPD of Tomio Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okamulovs come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet Vít Bárta for VV, then he obtained money from Dawn for his company, there was some coup.
He is, of course, a distinctive personality.
But somewhat brownish.
If I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that is what we can agree with.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, to speak at demonstrations with gallows and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering working with Mr Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine, but the voters decide.
It will be about the winner's negotiation with the second in the standings, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the number two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the agenda of the coalition government.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the state as a business.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything rot out, never decided.
Coalition matters such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was the reason he threw me out.
As soon as he did, CEZ took over the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the prime minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which obliges the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of CEZ.
If you become prime minister, do you change the personnel situation on the supervisory board and replace CEZ’s top management?
Jesus, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not being one yet.
It is whispered that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with the ČSSD for even better with ANO.
After the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any Lobbyist Pokorný or Růžička, I'm a separate unit, and I don't care about this at all.
So answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr Schwarzenberg's remarks.
Although the state has a majority in CEZ, he never managed it, he was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
For me, it's a trivial thing.
CEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, stick them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supplier competition or get a koinvestor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept of the state funding and building new nuclear units is absurd.
And Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me are conducting a permanent purpose campaign, but I do not have and will not have any competence to fire anyone.
But control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the Chamber of Deputies approves the report on their management, which has a direct influence on the positions of the CEOs of ČT and the Czech Republic.
Look at how the news is discussed, for the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission to escape from investigative files and lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that Kalousek was pushed by Kalousek to throw me out of the government, which passed the percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, and so they speak of a threat to democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first vice-chairman of ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power background by appointing his son to the supervisory board of Teplárny Brno and arranging contracts with the related lawyer Květoslav Hlín with municipal and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
We have a lasting dispute in this.
I don't like it, and I blamed him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't act like that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was a hint of clientelism in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it would be.
