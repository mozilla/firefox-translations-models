The great return of the Czech underdog is approaching.
Pavel Francouz was drafted into the NHL
Czech hockey goalie Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the bench and could soon get to the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Pilsen and Chelyabinsk, Russia, was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He took turns halfway through the game with Vegas, and since then he has not yet introduced himself at NHL rinks.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one stick to another.
"Pavel the Frenchman will be out of the middle of approximately three to four weeks with a lower-body injury," the Denver team announced in early October.
His return to goal in the NHL eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, American time was called up from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He scored 94.5% of his saves in the AHL.
The offspring of Pilsen hockey wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his last year he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic year he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL, the “Frenchman” caught 36 games, his success rate is at 92.3%.
Charles puts on a mask on a Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate, as this year's Christmas card, chose a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also made his wish, using a photo of his choti Camille in the racecourse helping to put on a mask.
This was reported on the BBC's website.
They send wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they work.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki and the dress has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing as much as Princes George and Louis shorts and a T-shirt with a collar.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not mention, it is not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, the royal family for a photo intended as a Christmas card posed on a bale of straw in front of a pile of wood in its country mansion in County Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at a racecourse in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her veil colourfully matched with a light dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have had a million crowns from Prague Slavia for the league title in the season 2018/19.
The news server efotbal.cz reported that it had accessed part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Vršovice Club, said that the red-and-whites had not committed any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who quit the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berbr and the former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused in the case.
The criminals reportedly worked with the information that Slavia promised Berbra a financial reward for when he won the title.
2019 the SK Slavia Praha team won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should have a million-dollar bribe from the officials of SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors of Slavie Tvrdík.
According to the server, the file no longer indicates whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The claimant refused any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017 we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opponent's alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, have not tried to influence referees in violation of the fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this context," Tvrdík told Seznam News.
In the interceptions, among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some of the former players of Slavia dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of allegedly influencing matches through referees was sparked last mid-October by a police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FACR.
The highest-ranking in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are Cold War larping.
The cannons will be of a new, but in principle worse type (artillerymen must from an armored cabin and carry cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyotas hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, moreover, have already managed to get rid of the Praga V3S even for specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we don't have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I have a chase right next to town.
Nutria crawled out of the river and did damage to crops, so I was there to sit.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down in peace and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something came out, but of course, soon the fox was going.
I let her come in at 40 metres before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving the headlamp on all sides, so I called out to him that it was for a fox.
Before I got off the seat, he was gone.
I.e. Even a meadow can be a pruss.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a coincidence for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in a thermal imaging that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, dear stuff, data to your feet in the spacak and you'd better be fine.
Vojtěch versus Hamacek.
The interior got the respirators considerably cheaper than the Department of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks to acquire them.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day the amounts for the respirator differed by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have behaved economically?
Why did others buy expensively?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the server iRozhlas Dominika Kubištová.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (I am probably not affected by the memories of the CSLA, which the older generation has undergone), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the compulsory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of technology that can take up training, we do not actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is still more complex, so the capabilities of reservists will rapidly lose time.
On top of that, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train someone again.
And finally, reservists/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where a mass guerrilla can be led and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the gerilla will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have the appropriate geography to do so.
We don’t have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst thing is that half of them play like they have it.
Then there are situations that you look like a dude who didn't hit an empty gate 2 minutes back, drives into the attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and you say to yourself "tvl and what do you think will happen now?".
Well, of course, they'll take him as the average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "spear defenders" is so terrible that I find myself honestly surprised to see that our attacker was able to play one player of the opponent.
The first swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing, however experts for the coming weeks are not expecting some major reversal.
The onslaught in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevalent Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infective immunity acquired by the previous illness helps against it.
But an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side has also entered the Covid equation this week: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from the company Pfizer, which reports a success rate of 85 percent of the results so far.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, have also highlighted the question of how prepared the local administration is for incoming medicines.
As mentioned, the first to reach domestic patients will be Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on the tape first because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for horse viral disease on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially us Czechs, are used to talking "how our beak has grown".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you that they do not.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing work and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, West good, east bad.
But they will find out what people really think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have more than 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that objects are three in the Czech Republic and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to learn where what is again, so all objects for the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brdy and the other two are abandoned.
Funny thing is, sssr didn't want to have nuclear warheads in their own territory either because of the safety or the speed of the deployment of the warheads because of the western position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only warheads were kept, not whole rockets, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived to pick up this warhead and mounted it on some kind of supporting device.
Besides the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
At the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Cigán, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made good jokes, he often showed up too much, but he was such a mascot.
Everyone talked to him, often went and wanted to explain something, he missed little, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he didn't steal snacks, he didn't steal phones, he walked clean clothes.
He also went to schools in nature, did various monkey shops, but he was fine, perhaps never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same year, a different class.
Shortly afterwards, they beat up a teacher, the police often dealt with something there, threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertisements (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I have sold often to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn’t try to stretch me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called in a month saying he'd already rewrote it on himself.
I say myself that I am not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave the way they belong in a decent society (works, works, women don't beat, just common behavior).
But when someone comes in, he stretches out his hand, he lives up apartments and houses, he only has a mess around him, he makes trouble.. so it doesn't matter what color it is, but I'll mind.
I don't have a problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
Young woman died in car crash in Prachatice region
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and unfortunately, despite resuscitation care, she succumbed to her injuries on the spot,” Zuzana Fajtlová, spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics, told Právo.
The crash was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchovec to the village of Bavorov and from unidentified reasons drove into the opposite direction in a corner.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, Štěpánka Schwarzová, a spokeswoman for the South Bohemian police, described the accident.
The young driver of Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
These were multiple injuries and he remained wedged in the car.
After his rescue, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was airlifted to the hospital in České Budějovice, said paramedic Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the other car suffered lighter chest injuries and was taken to hospital.
New rules apply to packages from outside the EU, customers often do not supply data about them
Lukáš Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
“Usually, it can be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars higher, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the post office is often free,” the collector says.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has become slightly more expensive, newly it must add VAT and the post office to hand over the data for customs clearance.
He receives an e-mail informing him that customs officers are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the VAT has not already been included in the sale by the trader, the customs office will measure it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide the customs procedure himself, the total amount must also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Lukáš Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it's mostly a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
However, not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad dropped from 60 thousand to 15 thousand at the international post office in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls for the delivery of data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30 thousand shipments at the international post office, which we have to process.
If people filled in all the data that is needed and would fill it out in time, we would be here about half, says Czech Post spokesperson Matyáš Vitík.
Addressing inflation
See headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is an employee)?
I've been added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while I'm a job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why provenly convicted rapists are only being put behind bars for 6 months?
My head just doesn't take this away from me, how can a court send such an animal to prison for only 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
And not to mention, a rape victim never has to recover from it.
Won't this even deter potential future rape reports of victims?
Man from Grave 'burnt' by his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave accidentally helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, to whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to her.
He went round about it.
First, he approached a passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged “robbed” told them that he had made everything up for the officers to come to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the officers on how to file a notice to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, officers then discovered that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant is issued on her.
The case is therefore handled by the Czech Republic.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not spoken ethnically or culturally anymore, but I would be interested in opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to ensure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I don't deny that we have Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
Here I cannot agree with Pascal, there is an estimate in the world, if I am not mistaken, something around ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god should man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it is that there is no god but Yahweh.
Wouldn't it be more rational, then, to refrain from believing in any god than to risk picking wrong out of the thousands of gods, and the one real god I didn't just hit will send me to hell or a similar place for that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months to one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the components of the Czech Army could use something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can speak this way: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly being recalled, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of intertwining, when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to employment.
Not only when growing up, but this process is constantly taking place, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
Similar intermingling should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way of building a kind of relationship between a citizen and an army, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or a Mongolian raider will never invade here again.
​I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies, and they will therefore defend us if there is a mess.
Well, please the lord.
Just one election in the U.S. that will circulate their budget and the whole of NATO is going to the cunt.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown once that they just need to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long been the guarantor of independence is the armed army and the population who can control the military equipment of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote-controlled resources, so what can't be done.
We don't need border fortifications, that's a fart today, but a peaching teenager behind a book of remote-controlled equipment can handle.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home covered with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of the shops was created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as a disposable waste.
Anyone can bring to the participating shop (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and avoid crowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently scarce on the market and also saved money, because the packaging carton has increased by 50% in the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I also strengthen my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and filling material are brought to our Popůvky near Brno by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular collections of deferred cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies together, we create a more respectful world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take the sorted waste from the home, where to hand over the pasted medications, tires, retired electro, batteries, light sources, high-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, in addition, reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project already contains more than 100 000 such places.
“Gradually, collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Ukliďme Česko association.
I find it sick that nowadays the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones in general simply hide the file underlyingsystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency before the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they cannot be done in six months.
French politicians like it that way, and voters like it.
Macron's supporters of the straddle between the right and the left agree little, but on Europe, yes.
And there will be new elections in France in April for the head of state.
The electoral calendar also affected the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such a work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately came forward with criticism that Macron was interested in pro-European propaganda and was rewriting history.
In fact, it tries to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is going around France right now, saying that the regime from Vichy, which collaborated with Hitler in the Second World War, was not so bad, and he is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea for one history book seriously and let's not look at the events in France.
Wouldn't it be needed?
Students in European countries learn history as a story us versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs learn who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the wider context of the event was.
Movie of the Year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, has also won awards for directing and best actress Jasna Duričičová.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary festival, he held the first places of the audience ranking.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was about like "having the flu/being pissed off" I had diarrhea for a few days and didn't feel like smoking much...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea in the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has it that way)

Those who have remained, and those who have left, know too little about themselves to spend it on a life together.
Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the replacement of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, the time of departure is only adjusted, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The sale of tickets was started by the carriers in the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6783 passenger transport services per day in the new timetable, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
The trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections within the new timetable, the railways will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, together with the new timetable, will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main innovation will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices from next year, by an average of 3.2 percent.
The runways take inflation into their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entry to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem – Mělník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Railways here after its success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
On the track, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections on the track, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which from Sunday will also stop at the stations Havlíčkův Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned closure work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar journey times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be replaced in some regional lines.
Changes await passengers, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of the Czech Railways.
Passengers will also be able to use a single rail fare for the second year running.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by an inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Don't we learn the other side's perspective?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they died.
I've never heard teaching in my life from the point of view of a slave party or from that time, no one defends this, just condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that black people themselves often sold black people into slavery, and that they were often the worst slaveholders.
No one at school will teach you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, they will just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, have slaughtered them, while murdering each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in Southern schools.
I have not encountered anyone intentionally concealing the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny this (for example, in Japan, the atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's point of view, without understanding.
History doesn't interest someone's feelings, it's just what it is and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, while we are with those Southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and famous slaveholders there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and I found it absurd to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was slavers, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately leave out some facts, they lie and manipulate, moreover, maybe our view does not exist (on YT there was also a video from television, where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous about US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that in some universities it was appalling, those students were quite radicalized and those schools supported them in it how many times they supported them.
And when I imagine these people are going to be much older someday, I'm a little sick of the fact that this could be the voice of the majority, because among the young there is and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has long since achieved what it had and it is no longer about the same, it has become radicalized.
Nowadays, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, so other groups themselves as LGBT, and it leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they hear it.
Anyway, in conclusion, I also did not encounter anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I encountered bad geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something connects me with people, interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek-Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he has a preaching about theology rather than politics, but then he always eats some cocoton about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but they were actually born out of Catholic modernism and are de facto Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but go to worship to the Hussites because it's theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michala in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they make a Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it over from Austria
Břeclav – The flame sparkled in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him this time, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal – Břeclav.
It was also taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate with the squad every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, scout Amálie Alarmová told reporters.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts travel by train to Vienna.
Nothing changes in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they will hand it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
The subsequent light delivery will be taken care of on Saturday 18 December by scout couriers, who will travel by selected speedsters and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take the light in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flames in the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Even this year, scouts must comply with current measures against the spread of coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We give recommendations to both those courier teams and organizers of local events, to of course wear masks, to try to observe spacing, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing colleagues, simply to behave in such a way that it is as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the event of Bethlehem light Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace together with the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is for the believer a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is based on hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are cancer of the economy, but I don't think the subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education make good use of the money, but I do not understand why the money is given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, an unnecessary product is produced and it crashes the free market and the “natural life of the company”.
I myself work in a factory where a million notice boards are “xy funded/co-financed by the xy project” in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work to people, this is a braking of development when this company is holding on and depriving orders/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet time also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertisements.
I don't think Internet ads move with me, but then I get caught up in the fact that they also influenced me - it's just so out of place that you don't always resist it.
For this reason, I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to impose a total ban on programmed (= targeted) advertisements...
It's all crap, in the words of the classic - I'd ban the internet.
I feel like this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that the majority believes and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I prefer to believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I will have my own original opinion about which I will claim that it is a cover thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Televisions have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, two hundred of them premiere this year
Los Angeles – Cinemas, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen through the trend of Christmas movies and will present a record more than two hundred to their audiences in the premiere this year.
This was calculated by the operator of the IMDb film database.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience in recent years, which is why more and more of these films are being produced.
This year, four times more Christmas films have been made than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will be a lot more holiday movies.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, the films Home Alone, Love Heaven or the Classic Christmas Story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
But the real boom of Christmas pictures did not kick off until 2009, when the American cable broadcaster Hallmark came up with a special film series.
Her Advent project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was very successful.
This year, the station started to tune its viewers to Christmas already 22. October and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
The rival Lifetime station has 35 new Christmas-themed movies this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total.
“In this magical period, the story doesn’t matter that much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it’s snowing,” said Brandon Gray, author of the book on Christmas movies I’ll be home for Christmas Movies.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the festive madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years.”
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then there is about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, is successfully solved and the two kiss.
It's like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch one after another, adds Gray.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, he won't hit the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin has had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the final race of the season.
The Haas team will send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better finish from 20th place, which he took in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas team will not eventually intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He has tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, from the last place will go to the track Mazepin's team-mate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively fine, according to the Haas stable, and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
He is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," her representatives told formula1.com.
He won't send a replacement rider into the race, nor can he.
A substitute would have to qualify or ride in another part of the weekend.
The first racer is not facing covid-19.
Kimi Räikkönen had covid-19 at the start of the season, last year Sergio Pérez Č Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could be locked up for this, too.
And everyone won't care that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid.
§ 152 The spread of contagious human disease
(1) Whoever intentionally causes or increases the risk of the introduction or spread of a contagious disease in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, by prohibition of activity or forfeiture of the thing.

c) if such an act violates an important obligation arising from his employment, profession, position or function or imposed on him under the law, or
(d) if such an act causes serious injury to health.
(3) By imprisonment for three years to ten years, the offender shall be punished if he causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death by the act referred to in paragraph 1.
(4) By imprisonment for five to twelve years, the offender shall be punished if he causes the death of at least two persons by the act referred to in paragraph 1.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will impress!
He is a bit like a portable jewelry store and the creator put into it half a year of work and all his savings.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, in our home sweaters never wore much,” admits Liban, who spent 3000 hours over his work in six months.
He bought Silk in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated with 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater,” the creator praises his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's another catch.
“I’m broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” admits Liban.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago has cost “only” 720 000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Engineers, explorers and drone pilots could be heading out before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with border protection with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially asked for help from NATO states in connection with several months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian soldiers are already operating on Polish territory.
Omicron mutation spreads in South Moravia?
Hygiene is looking into another case of a child from Adamov.
“We have reported further suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Primary School is not proven,” Ciupek said.
Six cases occurred in the county earlier in the week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is being carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Priot Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” said the director.
She added that they are two nurses from one department of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four symptom-free.
No one has traveled abroad with suspected Omicron
None of these traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they come into contact with anyone who would have resided abroad.
There is none of the association with the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
The chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being examined.
There were also players from South Africa and one Belgian player fell ill after his return.
California will cut gun sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortion.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state, using the legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law after detecting the embryo's heart rate.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit by anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
The announcement by Newsoma responded to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which kept Texas' ban on abortion in force, even though it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent-setting verdict that stipulated the right to abortion across the U.S. to roughly 24 months pregnant.
However, the court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on the technical question that arises from the innovative construction of the measure.
Enforcement of the ban was brought to the public in this case, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to assault him by the usual court.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday's) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which authorized the maintenance of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas' maneuver to protect its law," the California governor said in a statement.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect people’s lives.”
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would entitle public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are referred to.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim compensation of at least 10 000 dollars (over 220 000 Kč) and court costs from anyone who would produce, distribute or sell assault rifles in California, components to “ghost guns” or sets for their production.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets, creating a threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should do," the California governor said.
For decades, California banned the production and sale of military-style weapons, but in June, a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion on Friday's majority verdict.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas ban on abortion complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected officials of the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, gradually coming to what the vaccination schedule will look like and also improving the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, Israel is already in a large-scale study of the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to five times the increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, he will have his vaccination schedule after a while, but it's too early for that.
Another fact is that in a short time, a new vaccine should come on the market, based on an inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10x more effectiveness.

Poland threatens to halt payments to EU budget
According to Ziobr, the European Commission would act in violation of the law if it exercised the new power and stopped the payment of money to Poland because of a dispute over the rule of law.
The commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw 36 billion euros from the EU's fund to rebuild economies hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and apply a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries in violation of the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this blackmail from the EU veto in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy that lead to a drastic rise in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes more radical positions in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish judiciary underwent during Ziobrov’s tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is building "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland."
Warsaw is facing "political dictates carried out by blackmail and trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro said.
He stated that Poland should be a member of the EU, which is based on the partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
“We will never agree to Poland having the status of a colony,” he said.
But to know about it... In Lidl, they have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between vegetables and a lactose-free zone...
If there is avoidance, I will not even smell any more, the action of non-event, gold shop in the square, there may not have such a choice, but most of the time they have everything I need and it has some order, so I have done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't give a damn.
For two years, I've been watching the data being treated like manure, most opponents of vaccination are just a little more out of place than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussion is taking place at the professional level, but only extreme opinions are coming into the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Ban everything, allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparing apples with pears.
This state has it this way, and this is how we feel.
But that the data collection methodology is different in those two states no one solves.
Ugh, I was relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day for you all.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never because of the grades, mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was naughty (read instead to go to sleep, fight with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without notice, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "catch" the spoon only brought and put it so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen, I received a few blows to my butt (over my clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in a reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial because the child responds to them much more than to words.
The important thing, in my opinion, is the part with the warning, because it gives the child a choice in a way whether he will not listen and get, or improve and the punishment will not.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojtěch Cepl answered a journalistic question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him – whether the sacred document, which he swears and which he learns from school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once in the Constitution, we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl glossed the question at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion is increasingly emerging among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter through history.
The Constitution is, among other things, an order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid does not choose, in the University Hospital Brno fights for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus tends to be milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, 2 to 5 percent are spoken of compared to adults,” Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told the News.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the clinic of childhood infectious diseases.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on the ARU.
Children with post-Covid syndromes were on the ward according to the doctor continuously throughout the year.
"There is now an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old babies alongside adults.
There are also children in hospitals in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“At the moment, the baby lies in our country for several months and adolescent age,” the head physician said.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been recorded for coronavirus in the children's hospital of the University Hospital Brno.
According to the available data, the deaths of six children aged 0 to 14 years occurred in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in a children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – he is an integral part of the psychologist’s cooperation.
At the same time, he also draws attention to the fact that, as in adults, vaccination relieves the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
“Therefore, we recommend the application of the vaccine dose in children,” the doctor added.
In the quiet zone you can only walk on marked paths.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence to the field).
Skiing/riding a bike in the woods off the marked paths must not be anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much to watch outside the national parks).

China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China has embarked on both a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was reflecting criticism for failing to stop the outbreak that has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increase in those infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping much to fight the coronavirus, for example, even in the worst-affected Italy.
How to see the willingness of Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I've got him and he's great.
The wife likes to be because she grazes the grass, washes the car with a bog, the children play with him.
Well, just awesome.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you the elephant.
Friend: well, let's slap, that'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: you dude, what did you sell for an elephant????
The lawn is cracked, a giant shit everywhere, the car has been climbed, the children are fighting it, and the wife wants to be divorced.
The one he sold says, "You're talking badly about an elephant, you're not selling an elephant like that...
The world is dominated by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is precisely the superpowers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
It is still operating at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe by the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will work.
I thought of it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert on Czech, so maybe I'll talk.
I'm just starting with the fact that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another comment “Spanish oranges and mandarins”, when it is clear that it is both from Spain, while in the case of “Spanish fruit and mandarin” it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base it on the fact that the sentence is “all American forces” including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad concept and there is no need to specify it further with the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just talking :D
Either way, it's a pointless requirement

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured cosman's monkey Milly
The horrifying footage shows the moment the terrified monkey crouched in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her and laughed at her.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent magistrates' court has now banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who take care of Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened cosman before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabing Monkey World workers at Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother pleaded guilty to two allegations of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
A 12-week prison sentence with a suspended sentence of one year was imposed at the Municipal Court in Gwent.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was given a lifetime ban on animal husbandry and has to pay 12 000 crowns of court costs.
Small Monkeys team leader, who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue even further."
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She crouched and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, having settled down and being satisfied with the male, the sight of new people can still create panic in her.
Psychological scars from abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's abuse came to light after police in Gwent discovered the horrifying footage on the woman's phone after a raid in her apartment on drug charges.
The footage shows Milly swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland can be heard offering cocaine to the monkey and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found for 1600 pounds (less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what amazing concepts will you teach from this prehistory three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same stuff in your freshman year like you did in sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of buffing, when no one, honor exceptions, doesn't care if you can or understand.
Just write a test for 1 and then no one cares anymore.
Run and randomly ask people on the street whether to manage to determine the character of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority doesn't even cross themselves off and tell you they're absolutely in the pic.
So what the fuck is he fucking learning?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want and have no need.
And at that point, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly taught for a lot of people who will need the thing.
But like, the remark that you really don't need all this to stand by the machine, I was absolutely serious... because you just don't need to.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which probably also contributes to our communist past and to the people of the educated and elites) But the price of the fact that the barbars are going to stand for us in these machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, COVID would probably never have reached those proportions.
Wedding at first sight: The war of Kadri and Andrea continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right away," Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to the inquisitive questions of curious fans, what so disappointed her about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
It's been screeching between Kadrim and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move behind, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he got upset with Kadri in turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged honesty of Kadri now did not like his younger sister Linda.
She decided to publicly defend her brother.
I don't normally comment on such things at all, and even in the family, we never said to each other very much extra these things.
I don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, they just don't give it to me!
I'm sorry to have to do this in this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most even though he was at his young age.
I'm all the more sorry when I have to read such false information that's probably pretty taken out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri as much as I, our loved ones and family, in the confession in response to Andrea's words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and we know the reality and we know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe what it's for.
He launched his robbery in a parking lot in a residential area where he tried to break into several cars.
According to the available information, he eventually alienated from one vehicle in the amount of less than 330 crowns.
After that, it did not occur to him anything better than to climb to the 5th floor and climb into the apartment through the open window.
There he stole two bananas.
In the footage from one security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene while eating a banana.
When the owner woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She subsequently detained Chao.
The man confessed to drinking something of alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, he decided to plunder while drunk.
The whole thing is under investigation so far.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effectively bound to a pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business
Isn't that enough for you as a reason?
The right to assemble will be limited but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to Saturday's elections to the councils of four municipalities
On Saturday, the new councils voted in the villages of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lusatia in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and in Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils broke up.
A total of 28 seats were contested by 99 candidates on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of these is 69, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes for us a rather demanding but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, high-profile elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held, said Eva Krumpová, vice-chairwoman of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that because of the COVID-19 outbreak, the election was more challenging on both equipment and personnel security.
In Komni in the Uherskohradiště region, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
The citizens also won two seats in the council for Komňa, 18.52 percent of the voters gave them their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, has also reached the council for them.
The Comnians – independent candidates – have reached one mandate in the council.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
The association Pro Rovnou won in the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, meaning four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 also joined the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The Lusatia and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John won the repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region again.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second ended with the candidate Municipality for the People, which gave the vote to 43.27 percent of the voters, so she will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in the Liberec region were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nová Ves in front of the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the Association of Independent Candidates, winning four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
Yes received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, won a mandate more and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent of voters.
The election results will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
It will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this people here are writing to you.
You're just playing stupid so you have someone to "judge" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was a goal to look good).
I don’t care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I hate how much the Church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money she raked, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she caused, e.g., the thirty-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head-down from twelve metres.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, where paramedics of the regional Emergency Medical Service intervened.
The staff of the regional operations center received an emergency call an hour after Saturday midnight with initial information about the man's fall from above.
Two EMI crews – medical and medical – immediately went to the scene.
Upon arrival at the scene, the paramedics discovered that the twenty-seven-year-old man should have fallen from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
Coal caught in Vítkovice.
But not in the way it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the moment of arrival of the emergency services teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures within the framework of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to the next care of the Ostrava Trauma Center, said the spokesperson of the ZZS MS region, Lukáš Humpl.
I have more concerns than about the coronavirus from inadequate reactions from the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the military doctor David Cutter.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA has had a great gala full of interesting results.
Things were happening at the UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Peňová managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight weight, he showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also scored by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt off a technical KO in the first round.
He also defeated Sean O'Malley.
A surprise no one expected.
That brought the women's bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Peňa.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary “dwarf”, because Nunes did not lose for seven years and grinded her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the way to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
However, Peňová did not allow herself to be forced into any further mistake and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself using a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents were hit with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Peňová got Nunesová to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up trying and knocking off.
The American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier did better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter, he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed, but then he created a lot of pressure, got his opponent on his back and covered him with a series of wounds.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, to which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to knock off the strangulation.
The Brazilian defended the title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next game, he won a sovereign triumph, Sean O'Malley, who had already put a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
He subsequently recharged it with a series of precisely aimed strikes and recorded his 15th triumph.
Kara-France was then able to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now losing after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it is not difficult.
Most nouns in Czech express only one grammatical genus, and therefore it is not a problem to determine whether it is a male, female or medium genus.
But then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, in which the genus is not settled.
Such nouns fluctuate between two genera.
When inclining, they then acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words “draped” or “hip” are both male and female, in the first one they are bent according to the pattern of “machine”, in the second according to the pattern of “song”.
For another group of nouns, the shapes are already in the first fall of the single number, such as: “line/row”, “koluben/kohlrabina” or “potato/potato” (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are standard, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is non-standard, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "moat" and "ditch", "doughnut" and "doughnut", etc.
Some of the words that penetrated into the Czech language from other languages were originally uninclined, but gradually they adopt Czech endings.
A typical example is the term “image”, which is both male and female, or the word “buffet” that has remained inclined in the middle genus, but in the male it has endings according to the model “castle”.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like right on the Greek border?
There are tensions on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants attempting to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have begun to venture to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped preventing them.
European politicians promise support to Greece, humanitarian aid is also planned by the Czech government.
What motivates refugees to travel uncertainly?
What does the situation look like on the spot?
We haven't seen the blue sky for three months and we've been choking, describes a Sydney journalist
The devastating fires that Australia has been dealing with for the past four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the residents themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison's government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are rare enough.
That's why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don't know personally anyone who's been falsely charged.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I've experienced how these people often treat their surroundings or even the police.
Victims should always be believed.
The trend has come that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But there's still too many people to keep it to themselves.
There are also those who falsely charge someone.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusation is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you only help sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods unbuilt houses, families do not have money to complete
Building material prices have risen more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A number of people have been in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the resources to complete the houses and banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans.
In addition to the prices of material, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already built houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people are moving into unbuilt and unapproved houses.
At worst, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and pay rent on top of that," says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We'll build two or three family houses in a year, and fifty percent of the time, it's happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it's hard in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said Zdeněk Slivoň, the owner of the construction company.
A lot of people are still going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the construction of the house to be five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will wait," Slivoň added.
The most expensive of the material was copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction disciplines are missing, and the influx of foreign workers is holding back the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favourable at this time.
"The building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago," Křeček said.
We're fine, and we're gonna get better.
But the real vision is missing, says the commentator of the Czech Radio – mujRozhlas
In addition to the classic celebrations, the entry into the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and Chairman of ANO Andrej Babiš, and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the nation.
What fundamental things have we learned?
As in this, I find the thesis great just, I have my own topic, which I chose, I follow up with a bachelor, I always work on it all year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The statesmen are completely calm in our country, if a person is not a total macaque and something is left in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him on the theory.
For example, I spent a week studying at the statesmanship, and when I was finished, the committee always tried to guide me to some logical derivation, which immediately passed me and I had it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay for someone to do them the semester project (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then just learn the project and they are old.
I think it's great when there's an exam at the end of the subject, which translates into the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
But don't overwhelm all the emails and phones and send any parcels to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick as them.
Those people in the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the Pooh bear.
Maybe you can still put her so that he can touch Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks under the artists' feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
Plus, it still changes what feature is more important, whether likes, comments or saves.
I've been really worried about it lately, so I may have to lower myself to a tiktok where a lot of artists from my industry are successful and can't almost let it happen.
In the end, I might even like something user-friendly to come, that doesn't suck all creativity and energy out of artists
Statement of the Workers' Party in the Donbass
The union – yes, breaking up – no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind took place.
In the White Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Šushkevich, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with an open leniency attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “the Union of the SSR as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist.”
With one pen cut, they "canceled" a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
The collapse of the USSR has left tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Even without the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years during one session in the White Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created by the price of millions of lives in the Second World War and in the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously carried out deindustrialization, hindered agriculture, tore away from the world's largest power fourteen republics, which had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, the science, the military, the growth of crime, inter-ethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria – all this is the result of the geopolitical surrender, the surrender of the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as a “vacuum of power.”
Everything that was betrayed and given up in haste quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries, which adopted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken mainly because of the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover does not have to correspond directly with its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 Kč / kg.
I'll buy it with the idea of putting it in the fridge and making it into dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 Kč / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I will wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to 69 Kč / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would be different from what I bought on Monday 120 Kč more expensive and leave it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These bullshit about the fact that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or poor quality are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now I went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out a brochure, I always take similar things to help the part-timers, they can not throw it away...
Well, the booklet was full of common sense and conservative views of the workings of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agita.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good little thing, full of completely useless precepts, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
Too bad the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be felled.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to please that person because you like him without you realizing how much the situation is in the shit.
She threatened me several times to hurt herself because of that I went with a friend she didn't like to chat outside.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she started crying and begged me not to go anywhere on my knees.
Then she began to physically block the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year but then another six months passed and it started to be sewn on the head.
Then I ended the relationship with the one I told her from breaking up and lying her but we can talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch any amok.
Such a person will suck your feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better keep your distance
When insurance companies steal furiously by buying a cloud of tests and hunting for a positive, who wouldn't even know about the terrible illness if it wasn't for the test.
The only thing we achieve is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator were given five days of house arrest.
In the west, they had already stopped with the clowning, acknowledging that it was not worth dealing with a weaker disease than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and he has to steal something and drive his ego by inventing buzzing.
I see we're back a good old scumbag.
After several years of downturning and suppressing this unfair business, MLM recruiting is returning to the limelight again.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman in university), the initial promises of training products and business skills quickly flipped into "you don't have to care, especially get people".
I was honestly interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more like scaring and talking people.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if one wants to earn, one has to screw up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earners, so one felt like a door-to-door seller of pots.
What I can say, the experience was valuable, one learned not to jump to every spit and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in the same bag.
People are successful in this business and even benefit people, but they will certainly not brag about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I haven't experienced many such things in a corporation where I do.
HR is calm, managers are looking for their management and they don't put much of our noses in anything.
A regular evaluation happens somehow, in the form that it takes place in our country quite goes (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will look what came out and what not) - it is more self-assessment than that someone would rate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate action also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes you feel like we're almost-startup, which squats in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works that way doesn't bother us too much while the results are.
Czech woman missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that the woman from Uherskohradišt's region had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our embassy in London that they had found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not share more information on the case.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on the bus on November 28 on her way home from work, before boarding she was still supposed to pick up money from an ATM.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues from work five days later.
Subsequently, the London police began searching for her, Interpol ranked her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested one man a few days ago.
What role he had in the case and what he suspects, but did not disclose.
They have been awarded new councils in four municipalities towards the end of the year
On Saturday, December 11, new councils were elected in the villages of Komňa in the Uherskohradiště region, Lusatia in the Most region, Nová Ves in the Liberec region and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the statutory number or the elected councils broke up.
There were 99 valid candidates in the new election.
Voter turnout reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
The mandate was won by a total of 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for new elections to councils in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in the 28 regional posts.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically concludes for us a rather demanding but successful year.
It held four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, high-profile elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, evaluated.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12, at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I've had with the pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we have quite a dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major problems.
To cope with how idiotically a large part of the population treats it on all its layers, I have a problem with that until now.
I'm most looking forward to vaccination (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on the fact that other people are not an asshole.
He would be stripped of his duties as president and eligibility to regain it.
The chances that this will happen are very small, but as the others here mention very small.
Moreover, I'm not sure that a cardboard of a file could be considered treason at all.
High-treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: Does the number of people under the age of 35 who are without sex grows all year
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounce sex life has risen from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who have said they have not had sexual intercourse in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors also contribute to the decrease in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them may be the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks and video games, which make sex less and lesser priority for young people, could also contribute.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 has been growing rapidly, stating that they have not had sex in the previous year," IFS researcher Lyman Stone said in a statement.
In people in marriage, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% reported having been sexless in 2021.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under 35 are only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religious founding also contributes to the decline of sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 is still decreasing.
Young people share their opinion on premarital sex, about 30% think it's the wrong thing, while about 70% think it's okay.
“It’s true that among single individuals in this age group they are a minority, but their behavior shifts that trend,” Stone said.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, for single people under the age of 35 who participate in religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence ratio has increased from 20 to almost 60%.
Among the "less religious," the trend has lifted from 10 to 20%," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interaction and mainly social drinking of alcohol during the pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activities.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is less in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby "replacing" that need.
This trend has taken hold mainly under lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole ordering of vaccination against COVID is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave that they do not want, but that can save their lives.
It's a pretty tough question that I'm personally most interested in about the question of social conscience.
For example, the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an eighty-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he couldn't get vaccinated, and eventually he caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are responsible for the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who here, alongside the SPD and the Communist Party, is yelling something about bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it can be quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will actually be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How will the mild winter signify to fight drought?
This year’s winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic in recent times.
The operators of the ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather is complicated even by the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizera fifty.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have one story, but it's not about the master.
Once in high school, a teacher led us across town to the shipyard so we could ride on boats down the river.
On the way there we went once through such a quite wide street and who we probably do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare Kṛṣṇa sect.
Of course, they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but they talked to a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she was saying.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
We all laughed, including the teacher, all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
There's not that much going on, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
The new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept the violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
According to the chancellor, the crisis triggered by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border is worthwhile to be solved using diplomatic negotiations, including within the framework of the “Normandy Group”, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and is using people as living targets and a weapon, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed with the chancellor further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its patrons in the Kremlin would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU's eastern border.
Scholz assured the DPA that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident, trying to conceal it
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun, who was trying to take the blame.
When police told her that she was still responsible for failing to give priority to driving and driving from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had crashed into the vehicle, asking her for help.
Police then came for their sister Celestina.
They subjected her to a breath test and after discovering she had over two promiles in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, they told her that she would confess to her actions in court.
Dog Hugo does his best.
But Juraj Shaimovich did not keep his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have seen American stories about pets of dogs.
But they forgot the important thing: the regularities of the film craft.
After the kitsch movie F. Brabec Gump - a dog that taught people to live, now the audience emotions in cinemas are applying for another film Here we are guarding.
The co-writer of the screenplay and the director in one person, Juraj Šajmovič Jr., loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some of the familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava guest house, which is dying, and so begin to invite a dog owner, Julia's father with a partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) were already struggling with the procedures of storytelling in the previous dog film, but there were at least children and a dog.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of amazement and feelings of awkwardness.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to darker delusions in the desire for a child, and if the correct “constellation” comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just determine – on the bonnet of the car or church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with the local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the forestPlay the miracle process of healing by the dog.
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the power of animal darlings.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the content of the pelmel full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a competition of dog owners, a Šumava charlatan, cops coming to report in search of “drugs” and discussing the herbs of the fertilizer power of bone meal – and which the baked family in the guesthouse, of course, gets drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and sits on and down with a cigarette at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and slacks as a cured vegetarian, you can't laugh.
On top of that, the creators will explain to the viewer that “it happens sometime after a coma.”
Shaymovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build carrier situations, a feeling for the characters and the point and the directorial leadership.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut clueless and the overall impression is uptight.
Although Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their party, they have not much to play.
The only positives of the film remain poetic shots of the Šumava nature of the cinematographer Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to sketch several characters, a flimsy plot and dog catchphrases, let alone more popular vulgar expressions that the characters make.
The argument is not even the years-long membership in the Club of Dachshund Breeders - as in the case of the producer.
For good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
That failed in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little bit of eroticism and minimal feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece wouldn't have passed.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant swearing exactly from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here you can see how you understand that shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn't want to, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to that kidy all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in which case the extra earnings brigade.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Weather Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports just six percent of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It's also the right Christmas backdrop, Nazareth resident Wasim Askar rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, they are impactful and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, Lake Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to three last rainy winters.
The level has been dropping ever since.
Water managers warned of drought a long time ago.
"It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall may decrease here," Uri Schor, a spokesman for Israel's Water Management Authority, said in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
The worst is the economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tanker cars are increasing.
Water supply and private wells are drying up.
“This year, orders have risen by seventy to eighty percent compared to the two previous years,” Imad Suleiman, the driver of the tanker, reported in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes between farmers and security forces erupted.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed of the local river was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military crackdown on Iran
Israel's defense minister said the negotiations in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and that he had informed Washington of preparations for the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., is trying to persuade the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also informs Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said nuclear talks in Vienna had yielded "no progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians were messing with them."
About 3 years ago, this happened to me.
I lamented the lady a little and grilled during the conversation to find out what he was actually asking me to do.
I finally found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I gave the lady doubts and questions a little while longer and finally thanked her and left.
Feel free to tell me I'm a thug, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains this weekend, waiting for plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operation.
The downhill skiers were not discouraged even by the obligation to prove themselves with the lifts with a Covid certificate.
While lifts do not complain about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rentals report weaker demand for their services than before the outbreak.
Thousands of people in the Liberec Region went to the cross-country trails and the slopes at the weekend.
The skiers were happy with the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend really came out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
The weekend attendance was very decent, on Saturday and today an estimated 400 people came.
The conditions are superb.
Today was the sun, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branná Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell a ski pass to people who are vaccinated or who are within the deadline after experiencing the covid-19 disease.
With exceptions, people are ready for this and are proving themselves with the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski center told the Czech Press Agency.
"We've only recorded units of incidents," he added.
Some ski equipment rentals and shops report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from the Opava shop Skiopava.
He expects a bigger onslaught during the ski courses.
David Šinták, managing director of the Snowbear company in Hradec Králové, also feels that due to COVID, there is no such interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost lent.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told the Czech News Agency.
People, according to him, have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental company in the Novako area on Boží Dar registers a great demand.
Ski rentals started there a week ago and those interested must already order them in advance.
“We are starting to lend this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the operator of the complex.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also in the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to find a dentist or a doctor specialist.
Smart and skilled people who have no property are going abroad.
The owner of the company won't really go abroad.
With the rest, absolutely consent.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have the prospect of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orban winning one beautiful day, the year reigned, and suddenly the year-long emigration increased by a few tens of thousands.
It is naïve to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election.
If you live here stupidly, some traditional V4 crazy guy can win here, too.
Young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
A scary photo!
Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the staff of the film Island, headed by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloodied photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a makeup for filming?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor, from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncová worked, said in a Saturday video.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 19:45 on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srtcová was a "nurses assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help her find to contact the police," the statement continued.
The public is also calling for cooperation from MP Harriet Harman, who drew attention to the case of Srnce during a press conference on Saturday.
"She's been missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried about death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel like we all have a particularly high responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her homeland, away from her family, and worked here for our health service,” Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC, police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e., about 5 divisions).
I don’t underestimate Ukraine that way.
These are not "huge quantities" but about 8 percent of the Russian military.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the invasion and starting to get our entry full of teeth.
I quoted upstairs.
I don't know what he decided Russia wanted war on.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
The comparison with the situation in year 38 is out of the question on so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare it with the first Punic war and the "anex" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia will annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be consistent with.
It, the sunt servanda...
New timetables have been in force in Prague since Sunday, mainly to touch suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital, the speedsters from České Budějovice have been stopping since Sunday at the Garden Town station.
In the suburban train transport, the trains S7, which on the route from Beroun to Český Brod pass through the Prague Central Station.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will be newly stopped in the recently commissioned Prague-Garden City station.
PID will now expand to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be included in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines with an overlap to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
77 lines will be cancelled during integration, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 operating will be modified.
From Prague Zličín, there will be a new bus line 405, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection has also been established in Prague – Kralovice u Rakovníka, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
The morning rush hour and weekend will be strengthened, when the express line number 404 will be newly launched.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 running to the Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They leave the Střížkov metro station, not from the station Nádraží Holešovice.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
The additional line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubou to Doks, Mimoň and Jablonné in Podještědí.
On the contrary, the operation on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, is newly cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are canceled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions on the lines of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and around Kolín continue.
Changes are also waiting for passengers in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dobříš with connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch for the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to go next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy pizza buns and yogurt and apple for snacks.
Q: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about trees that you have to see.
Only the tip of the tree can be hidden under the snow.
If it is damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from off the slopes, but it's one of them.
Admitting to Gifts about a relationship with Nedvěd: I wasn't looking forward to this at all
The Czech show business pond has been living since Friday with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They've been pulling it together since the summer, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to fans explaining why she had kept love from them for a long six months.
“I would like to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, i.e. sorry, Nedvěd,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer up to her ears.
He said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days is the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we were both not looking forward to, but we knew it would happen someday, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether those who don't care at all and jump out of them and canned, or we whose lives they're dissecting in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend would be quite attached, or if you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a crub, that's what you want, it bothers Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has been the vice-president of Juventus football club for a long time.
They went out with the truth now, waiting for the completion of Nedvěd's divorce.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not only three weeks old on paper.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That is why I love my new husband, and just as he does with me, I stand by him. For better or for worse, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commenters probably already said everything important, I just confirm that the tracks are great to the beginning, my classmates usually got to know each other during the first semester or two and became friends and found subleases together, which seems to me the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Flats are usually not advertised long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but looking at the offer will certainly not hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejla, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., that is a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, the district of Veveří is very student, the King's Field and in that direction it's fine, besides, it's close to most faculties of BUT (I don't know exactly where you're going).
I have never been looking for rent, but I am a native Brno, so I can eventually advise Brno as such, if you still lack any information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Because of what a few doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite right that the state does not adequately finance some schools.
Either let them learn what they want and pay for it from their own, or let them go according to the state and pay the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education just because he will throw a few crowns to the full state contribution and thanks to that he will be able to teach what he wants in schools.
Such a claim somewhat loses weight when it is written by a man who two days before expressed himself in this way about the petition action for the boycott of the totalitarian state:
So the vote against whether someone goes to have an abortion is the same for you as a voice against a statue standing in the square?
I'd consult with you directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloging/digitalization that (even long-time professionals) either throw it from the eye, or write something in the manner of xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and in the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
Personally, I would deal with it in a note according to what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and hard-working student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created his own character, which fits what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn’t it more of an Odry Empire (the kingdom) than the OdryNs?
PSS: Someone's already cracked your place.
Check out the comment with ΦΙΛH
Politicians don't even know what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse deal than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood any text is laughable.
All important documents approved are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough for this, that is the matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suitable for informal relations, the establishment of above-standard relations.
Moreover, with the English, it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Cejl.
I've been working there for three years and I'm totally fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10 p.m. and never any problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly taken refuge there in his life.
Yeah, the majority of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is get in the way on the sidewalk and I park where they don't have :D it's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and mistress Gelemová like a stake in a fence!
Who's he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent wreath lit their first candle, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw the Wreath of Dādy and Lucie must have one, said the Lightning saxophonist, who so confirmed the words of Patras that he often visits her.
She visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he'll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Annie, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: TOGETHER AGAIN!
But we were still talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts on an ongoing basis and I will definitely buy something for Dáda and Lucie, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of the music video for the Richman club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was glad to meet his wife Luděk Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so explain that to me?
I don't know of any other ingredient that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few cops and they can't afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else such a high percentage of medically trained people are at that level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend just Ostrava goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, it has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just supposed to be a food factory, the journalist says.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters have decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and smaller rainfall also registers places where there has been no moisture.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
However, the impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it'll be so, I can barely keep myself in the skates on the ice, mushrooms I know what is playing hockey and the tactic (what I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a halluz overall.
And whether you're a hockey team "copper Russia" or "lama China" so lose by two goals even if you don't have to win the game at all costs is different than when it's leveled.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators what they pick, what the referees notice, do not notice, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's probably the case with all the sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it were the opposite, it is as always, and that the Czech Republic has lost to Russia more often than it won, it would probably be a classic "s will lose" vs "We won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people are hospitalized.
A total of 34 451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic 1967 are at 100 000, 871 per 100 000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29 929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest daily number since 13. October.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, it is the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain faces an "inevitable" large wave of the outbreak, caused by the Omicron, dr. said on television on Sunday. Susan Hopkins, chief medical counselor for the British Health Security Administration.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
So far, no one has died from omicron, but hospitalizations occur about a fortnight after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz had taken place "virtually," through a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from his prime ministership.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
Both the British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial television editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won by an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from his post as prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have evolved.
Do you want to turn and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that may end Viktor Orban's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European importance.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won't even be free, because that wasn't even the last two elections under Orban.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
The last one is that everyone can vote where they want in practice.
This will allow Fidesz to bind voters from the decided precincts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating, they're not fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It used to be a matter of whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if he would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a unified opposition.
That's a big unusual thing for Viktor Orban and his party.
Won't they be trying to keep the power to play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of the speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Köver leaked to the independent media, telling the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the hints of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of those news.
It all starts with the tongue.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mother's parents do not have much patience, neither do I, my dad has a long time, but then she explodes extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I was angry as a little girl, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cramp and it was all blue, they took me under the shower about twice to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me in the education, sometimes it was more that they didn't know anymore.
I definitely also have a tendency to solve things with violence, when I was a little girl I was quite fighting, now I'm going to at least hit something and as a younger parent I slapped my parents so much (to get too much over the handle), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure that upbringing has a share of that, too.
I'm afraid I'll lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer “educative”, but out of frustration, on the other hand, perhaps every parent just fucks something up, it is probably not possible not to screw up their children at least a little, so I can’t blame them.
It doesn't offend me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws are supposed to be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call the Kundami what the laws create in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a loss of income?
Is it really possible to count on people wanting and buying the product and you have something to pay the mortgage from?
Kočner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of the killers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four defendants for the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but it also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connection to the top Slovak politicians and justice.
How fundamental a turning point will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is hugely the fault of journalists.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all the medical faculties that came out a day, two later?
No, they let themselves go crazy, and the company bounced back.

The next government is ending and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček's proposal needs fundamentally overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is over, and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of a deep repository of high radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Government's Legislative Council has interrupted the discussion of a proposal submitted to the government after years of delays by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the municipalities concerned in the Platform against Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government expects the law to significantly strengthen its capabilities when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European directive.
We expect the new government to rework the proposal in cooperation with municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The draft law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which has the Platform at its disposal, is particularly accused by municipalities: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be really effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in the locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Repository Administration to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of the specific proceedings.
The proposed proposal almost completely omits the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statistics in permitting procedures.
The design lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire search process and selection of the location for storage, its permitting and operation.
Representatives of municipalities, in reality according to today's legal norms, do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the Office or the Minister, in whose interest it is to issue a permit, decides.
The possible action does not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of reconnaissance or construction work.
The co-decision of self-government requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically advanced countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in permitting the repository, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, among other things, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SÚRAO and related to contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
According to the Register of Contracts, the total amount for these works is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Seknička, deputy mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the Hrádek locality and a spokesman for the Platform against Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who only put the settlement of the position of municipalities against the state authorities in search of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for its support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building similarly to the directly concerned municipalities in selected localities.
The platform against deep repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and towns and 16 associations) to enforce a change in the state's approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-sea repository.
The Platform also advocates that the decision on the selection of the site for possible storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) was forced to lose weight fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And that worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the big guy from the sitcom Roseanne, he's a completely different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I've been sticking everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to do it slowly this time.
Moving, exercising.
I'm getting to an age where I can't afford to sit in place anymore, said Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and what you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it's any text on a platform that awaits readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't be translating it at all.
If it were a formal text and perhaps a university text, I would probably look for how to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls, etc. has bosses a few, right, and so "boss" is something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not at all needed to beat the game or level to be completed, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly compete with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called that at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
The flat-rate one-word one-word one-word boss is probably not possible, Czech and other languages do not solve it in any way (it is interesting only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, an opponent stronger than all the previous ones and guarding the completion of a level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Petra from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Petra Srncová since 3 December.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for the 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradiště region since December 7.
Through Interpol, he also helps the British police.
Czech Petra Srncová was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol released the so-called yellow circular because of it.
The whole world is looking for Petra.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
"We share information about the case," she added.
The search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, skinny and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her
The search for Petra was also carried out by the local MP Harriet Harman.
She was involved in putting up leaflets with Petra's face.
"We're very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police officers have already arrested one suspect.
It is not clear who he was and what he had to do with Petra.
The Czech Republic is being terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a slight drop in attack campaigns, last month, with the end of the year approaching, the attacks intensified significantly.
We saw a big campaign in connection with the Tesla Agent on November 18.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email is supposed to attract attention in the user by a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month the dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the receipt correction for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
The Formbook spyware remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November caught up rather in campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but continues to be behind almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks were carried out continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often included an attachment with the .exe extension, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt continues to appear.
The appendix in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decrease and suppression of activity is recorded by security analysts at the Fareit program, which was worth 1.6 percent of the attacks and in the Czech Republic has not had any major attack campaign in the last few months.

The procession through Prague was bigger than the media reports.
According to the footage of the procession along the waterfront and in my experience, the protester is not afraid of an estimate of around 10 thousand people.
People in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That means people a lot.
An unprecedented number of passers-by are spontaneously added to the procession of about four thousand protesters.
I say that something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the continued dissatisfaction of several large groups or layers of the population led to them finding common ground.
Only the anti-vaxers themselves, anti-drapers and co. could not fill or pay for such a large procession.
The actions of the association Chcípl pes have an upward popularity, it reminds me of a Million Moments for Democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed out of this discontent, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a four or more dosage.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or centre-left movement, you bet that.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to get revaccinated every six months.
I'm very happy that the vaccines saved us.
The genius actions of scientists that humanity is rightly proud of.
End of the stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has commissioned the formation of a new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue to change, which won the November elections.
He has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition that should take office within a few days.
The country's political crisis has been going on since April, when the past government lost an election under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties proclaiming the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the "secretly" shots is a global hit.
In Britain, concerns grew over the fate of a 32-year-old Czech woman who has been searching for London police for several days.
Petra Srncová was last seen two weeks ago when she drove home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, information about the child hospital worker is being called upon by her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor, from the police department in the Lambeth district where Srncová worked, said in a Saturday video.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech woman left work around 19:45 on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was reportedly last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
According to British media, Srtcová was a "nurses assistant" at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association.
"We have enormous concerns about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," a group of medical facilities said in a Twitter post.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that might help her find to contact the police," the statement continued.

In Ústí nad Labem, a moon hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was a matter of life.
The magistrate referred to complaints about the ŘSD, which owns the road, and because it did not respond, the hole went further.
Finally, the authorities cleared up their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month the ŘSD began to “intensitly address the situation”.
