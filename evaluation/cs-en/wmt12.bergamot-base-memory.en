Parliament did not support the amendment to the liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal a paragraph under the amendment to the Criminal Code, on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendment, which would open the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-premier, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of a proposal to ease the penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for entering into a supposedly unfavourable contract with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the appeal of the convicted person is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko calls the ruling a political revenge of the regime, the suspicion of the bias of the court sparked a trial even in the West.
The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the ex-premier was convicted, was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
It was required to approve 226 votes.
Libyan Victory
The story of Libya's liberation, or Libyan rebellion, which has its defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and is after the war without him.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the region, the Islamists will win the election, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the customary law of Sharia, and we already have an idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because theft is cut by the hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith await execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator's person, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Quran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is neither the only, or objectively best, and it probably would not suit the Libyans for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic warriors have taken thanks from unbelievable dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view, NATO air raids were not driven by a general from America, but by Alah, whose greatness they celebrated with each successful intervention.
So when the winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in the firefight, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of the dictator without guaranteeing any profit.
After a fresh bad experience of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
Thus, the locals have no problem with the expulsion of the "crusaders".
But will they have Libyan black gold without the occupation of the oil company?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the selfless protection of human rights.
Unless those followers of the Sharia law can stop us.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe came to the attention of investors
The statistical storm swept through Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have released GDP figures for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-quarter, Germany and France are growing.
Today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors are no longer just looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany, in addition to better than expected (a growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), France said that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated quarter-on-quarter and thus confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in the growth of the economy’s performance.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated quarter-on-quarter.
The German economy grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
Both the eurozone and European Union economies grew 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
Greece's economy contracted 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical borders.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are also starting to feel the problems.
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds are holding below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euros.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrate the advance for 200 million
The football team has mastered the toughest task of the season!
Thanks to the great Czech and beautiful goal of Petr Jiracek, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
Czech football, with a great portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxury lead from a home rematch and will again not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progression match in a detailed report.
Hardly any excitement in the first half and a big portion of luck in the second.
Thanks to the domestic destruction in the finish, the great Czech and the hero Jiracek won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the promotion to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins did not come under pressure until the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech team.
The underdogs of the match became Damjanovic with Vucinic, who burned two great chances.
Thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not be missing in the European Championship next year, and the Czech national football will also receive a reward of about 200 million crowns.
There has been a lot of fighting football since the opening minutes.
Both teams were difficult to get involved in the combination and were played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of the domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense precisely averted the long kicks for the defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a live shield
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the property at noon on Tuesday, and then proclaimed the deaths of the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred students of the universities of Isfahan in Iran created a live shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, in which uranium is processed.
They are thus clear that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran had apparently not stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is being talked about in Israel.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfana nuclear facility and then proclaimed death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, the target, in addition to the Isfahan Center, would also be to equip Natanz, in which uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not eat and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of schoolchildren weighing overweight and 5 percent of children.
Obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey has shown.
It shows once again how important the environment in which he grows up is important for the healthy development of a person and the patterns he is surrounded by.
On the tables of obese children, for example, sausages appear up to half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with the awareness event called Obesity is no coincidence more than 19 percent of the obese.
It is also not customary to play sports in the families of fat people, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children replied that their parents will find time to move actively at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity event is not a coincidence, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Proper eating and plenty of exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically increasing number of children who are overweight or even obese.
"Only half of respondents, for example, said that they eat five times a day in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," reads one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no sausage in the evening
Experts warn that relative details, such as regular family breakfast time, are also essential for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst was finding that in a tenth of households, breakfast doesn't even have breakfast.
Breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of children surveyed regularly play sports, their parents had a less than half-percent result.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to assemble their own diet according to their own taste and own opinion from the offered options.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from the ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of floury, meaty and sweet dishes.
"What is particularly alarming is the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on the survey said.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta won just above the poultry.
However, the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetable dishes is also low.
Proceedings to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"There is no coincidence for the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the awareness lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, in many cases there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy eating," the project results state.
This was striking, for example, in sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also ticked poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire much more often and would limit sweet food and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, pros say
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I complained a little bit that there was already a lot going on at the opening hours.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on set.
And it'll get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "trapped."
This time, Principal Alice and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And such are the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves and someone is overweight again.
The stylist must know how to visually soften the wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips on how to put the figure on a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, and at the same time not to dress the woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between a waist and hips is that the skirt or pants really do not fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece tailored to your needs.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a tailored skirt, you will feel much better than in one that constantly shifts, rolls up, stands out at the waist and the like.
The boy's figure, in turn, can afford to wear clothes with a sewing, app, embroidery or recruiting.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that given the assigned homework, it's up to.
Each of the courses was assigned a celebrity, to whom she is supposed to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the fashionable style of the personality and the type of figure.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I rejoice in my spirit, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained perhaps a hundred pounds (please take into account the exaggeration), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the suits from the magazines or search the Internet and print them and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to the graphical representation.
Thinking about the graphical side of styling is important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, for example, trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's not until Sunday.
A stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture, packed with information about the types of characters, was diversified by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a cloak, but you can also wear it on a bare body, put on pumps and take pictures like a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or collars and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he pointed out.
But what I appreciated the most was the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jakub said.
Finally, I know why we are crushing all those teachings, what to combine with, for what, why, when even in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have prepared a lot more variants of clothes than can be photographed.
So in the fashion story, which will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo of clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
This is what we have to do when creating an outfit.
That the image and style sometimes make up to half of the success, was confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it unnecessary (it is enough that I know something, the way I look in it is secondary).
And if someone already lets us create styling, then we should count on the fact that it is very likely to dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than it really has.
Then we have to google and find out if the tabloid wrote about the fact that the celebrity has grown/lost and so on.
Both Honza and Mario on Sunday asked us that it is not enough for a stylist to navigate fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to judge people, not to pander, to stand up for your opinion.
"When a manager orders you to sort through her wardrobe and complete it with nice pieces, you can't throw her out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things there that you praise and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "platka" must contain, or a bag for the set.
It's the one you turn on around your waist and you have all the necessary propriety on you.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair rollers or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with which the stylist helps himself to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips that we fasten the back of clothes, if it is larger (pin or other clamps are not permissible, they would damage the garment), or a sewing machine.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something, we learned how to properly grab the shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We must not touch the shoes with scissors, so that they do not happen to be damaged.
It is really necessary to be skilled.
I was pleased when he praised my creation without reservation.
The skill mentioned is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming more and more clear to me that doing styling on a professional level is really not a walk in the pink orchard, no matter who says what.
In Need for Speed: The Run, racing across America.
Reviews
The originally carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes, turns into a routine morning trip to the shift.
The ambition was largely fulfilled, but it is of no use if no one apparently wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode, subtitled The Run, was high expectations before the release.
He promised that the age-old racing series Need for Speed would again move a bit in a new direction and from playable demonstrations appeared to be a game that might not be just in number in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious about how the inserted passages will turn out, in which the main character gets out of the car and will take place on his own.
However, as is customary with the NFS series, many are a little different than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing more or less in the series for several years.
So it's not even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of the incomprehensible laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal character and as a solution offers participation in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings with it some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t feel like the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-class.
But driving across deserts, autumn landscapes or high in snowy mountains looks visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are from time to time diversified by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get caught up in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to be covered by an avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well planted behind.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up with time (classic fight with stopwatch) and then you have a duel with a single opponent.
The police will get involved from time to time, which makes your efforts even more difficult.
New are the passages outside the car.
Rather, it is just interactive animations, when Jack usually flees from someone and you have to help him by printing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
It surprises, however, that these passages are in play much less than you would expect (specifically, perhaps even three).
As a result, however, it is for the benefit of the matter, because this element has no chance to become annoying and in the context of the above is thus one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
This means that it is definitely not who knows what, but it cannot be said that it is a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will need to look elsewhere.
But the more action-oriented racing of the local driving model still suits quite well, although we could find better in the competition.
Until now, everything is in perfect order.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the model is not very well.
We do not expect the game of this type to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea before any impact on any object, how your car will behave, then probably everything is not quite right.
Typically, when you overtake or pass cars in normal traffic, sometimes you just lick each other easily, but other times in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not matter much, but it will make you very disilly.
The restarts are designed in such a way that if you smash or go far off the track, the game will throw you back on the last point on the track.
There are only five restarts in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool in case something goes wrong than that you can explicitly rely on them.
Sometimes even restarts do not help, they will be solved by the need to learn the given section of the race by heart.
The big ailment of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply can not fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It annoys especially in situations when you see the opponent passing easily between two oncoming cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to go around or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "counted" so that the situation always occurs just before your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
In the whole time of playing, you will come across several places where you, again, regardless of time, will always overtake the same opponent in the same place.
It hits the most at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get there in front of you at any cost.
When driving in front of you, it makes your overview of oncoming cars worse, so you can use a few times there.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-inducing, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgust you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes even so actionable that sometimes you literally can't watch where it flies.
And it doesn’t really matter whether it’s due to the concept with fifty unique tracks, the gearshift of races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance or anything else.
The unconventional idea is to replace cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas stations by the road, because that is where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical riding, for example, on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the mode of challenges, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
For obtaining a higher level of the driver, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected to the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your achievements with other players and provides additional community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you can get to the subway tunnel (so be it) where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (so be it).
On the speedometer, the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (so be it) flash and in this the subway train comes in from behind and uncompromisingly scraps you.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a few more days to discuss whether no one really thought a little bit when creating the game, or whether the authors think we are really such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more tense moments the imaging decreases, in some cases quite tragically.
However, this applies especially to crashes with a larger number of participants, when smooth imaging would be of no use to you anyway.
The sound side is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack was created from the category "each dog different village", but it can be assumed that due to listening to music, the game will probably not be bought by anyone.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so embarrassing.
If the game avoids completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of NFS in the last few years.
This is how the game is unfinished.
The fun is definitely fine, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will smash you into the eyes with the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for having negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to stabilize a little, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To the extent that she takes her motto "Comprehensively and openly about Europe" seriously, she already showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the Charles University could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was lackluster, that he was a grey official, that he couldn't play any role, and I had to say that everyone was taking a breather, that he did the role well."
"He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them well and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: "Who is this European Union? Which phone number should I call?", as an important step towards the unification and greater readability of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from cheese
Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency described it as a success.
The Czechs dealt with the oncoming financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was described as a big negative, which damaged the Czech Republic very badly.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, the "fact of the problem" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being solved today.
Moreover, the new seven-year Union budget has yet to be approved, which is very complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and austere, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, all of which is on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "On Europe intelligible."
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, a mischief that no one understands.
How is a citizen supposed to understand that in Brussels there are no curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes or that someone really has to ban us from cheese.”
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative than positive aspects of things.
Moreover, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, a lot of factors are to blame, for example, the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approach, the Frenchman next to me will say, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what about your Visegrad Four?" and he doesn't look excited about it at all."
In the future, according to Vicenová, the Union will face mainly new tough rules on the budgetary policies of the member countries.
He perceives the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European Federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries they wanted and those who did not want to cooperate should be near."
"There will be more institutes and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicen said.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all topics that have an impact on the whole Union are to be discussed among all Member States, not only among euro area countries.
Brand story:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that most accurately expresses IBM's strategy, the closest thing would probably be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The basis of this long-term was laid by the first boss of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that a number of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became an imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
“For us from IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred we will be able to achieve even more," said Samuel J., the company's current director. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson in the 1930s approached the care of his employees similarly to the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM had paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and an elaborate system for rewarding the best inventors and merchants.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant at making talent from the start - as one of the world's first companies to abolish any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that the Palmisana at the head of IBM will be replaced by a woman next year - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and has been the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called jams in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institution with a reputation
A strong position in the business is ensured by the company’s strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology firm," said the Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology firm, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and thus creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue," as it is dubbed the log in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology firm, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
With about $220 billion, IBM became the second-largest technology firm this year by market capitalization (the first is Apple) when it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all products and innovations hit the tastes of customers and times - IBM, for example, failed to bet on its own operating system OS/2, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on moving forward, you can't emotionally bind yourself to the past," Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and when they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, for example, a rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s sales are the largest to the point of service, with software and hardware forming for about a fifth.
In 1990, with more than half the share, he was the strongest representative of the hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15bn, over the same period, investing $58bn in the purchase of promising technology.
It has continued to invest since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept through the world for the first time.
IBM is acting according to the legacy of its first chief executive, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it looks like IBM is going through the current crisis unaffected.
IBM's share price has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, the firm's net profit is continuously rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will handle it.
IBM history: From cheese slicer to spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a century ago, originally called the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It did not take over IBM until 1924, originally a brand used for the company’s branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as the famous "pricks", i.e. the clock recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company’s supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed IBM's founder - Watson's ideas still have built on invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson was the company’s boss, turnover doubled to nine million dollars and the company’s extensive expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that almost forty years in the boss's chair he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM humans and computers helped NASA drive flights to space - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "péc" that established the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, while buying a consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote its full attention to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying off for IBM over the past three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, the "smarter planet."
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in previously unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or urban administration.
For the business area, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She established her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM ČR, it also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, save the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she does not want to wait and has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová in her home in the summer, she probably did not even dream how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, made peace with her husband's relationship, and now she even said goodbye to him forever.
The rychist doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář and Bartošová broke up once, he will not be waiting for his wife's open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him out."
"But he will live to life not like my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain connections," Rychtářová revealed, adding that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph's fact that Darina closed his back door doesn't matter yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife has set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I shop."
"Darina and I are having a normal conversation, except we don't share a bed together," said Lightning Rychtář.
If Rychtářová also finds a new love, she will not be prevented from doing so.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
The worst female bad habits: Do they concern you?
When you ask men if they could list some typical female bad habits, as a rule, they all very promptly spill them out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where are there several female bad habits that can perfectly pump blood in men's veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop and buy in bulk in discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their buying passion a little.
But tell me, which would resist just walking around the clothes shops, looking for well-fitting uppers on each other and then try them all (ideally in different colors) in the booth?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a ready-made hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you outside the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
That it is?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners are constantly complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaining increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping tiles, wiping dust, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on clean tiles with his dirty foot, for getting dirty with a scruffy sink and getting a glass living wall with which you did so much work?
In case you suffer from this "pervert", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not come first within the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships and family well-being.
Snashing
"Throw the used shorts in the trash."
"Will you wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet cloth doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner several times a day, know that you can reliably dial him.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to dig so much into them...
Gossip, scratching
For some women, gossip, gossip, but also insulting and conspiring against someone are also inherent.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release some small harmless gossip or gossip from time to time.
Hand on heart, it's inherent in all women.
But the opposite is the gossip of the grossest grain, which they like and often gossip, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's work team.
Jagr and Voráček helped assist to Philadelphia's win
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated in Monday's NHL game with two assists on Philadelphia's 5:3 victory on the Carolina ice and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player of the match, benefited from the list of thirty-nine-year-old stars.
Jagr's teammate Jakub Voráček also scored two assists in the match.
After the game, Jagr told overseas reporters that he had predicted a big evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the game that he'd give a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get such a feeling," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the second intervention of the team also had a Czech lead.
Voracek won the disc behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the circles to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
Seconds before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer was downgraded, but the opening of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored his third goal, then his shot was re-shot in Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely among the top three," Jagr praised his centre.
"I never thought I'd be playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to play me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Carolina still made the game a drama, Tuom Ruutu's goal, and again Dwyer, who asserted himself from a penalty shot, got on the difference of one goal.
However, Matt Read did not allow further complications, ending with a two-on-one outnumbering.
"He hit Pronger well in our zone."
"He poked the disc, I picked up the speed and (Read) drove to the far pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voracek captioned the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo, he withdrew in the second period due to an upper body injury.
The Candiens, in addition to an experienced beek, also lost a two-goal lead and lost after a 2:3 penalty shootout.
Tomáš Plekanec did not change one of their raids.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was saddened by the extensive Morodka of the back rows, finishing the match with only five defenders.
"It's wrong."
"We played the match with only one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The alternation behind the alternation was rolling in on us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, shifting the puck from our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of the P defenders. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg hits to a 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted a five-match losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How have the prices of tours evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia at that time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies were overwhelmingly only selling tours to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within socialist countries.
In the event that a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual route was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand the queue overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to get funds (western currency) for the trip to the West.
However, by far most often the Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs bought and this custom survives to this day.
The travel of Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible to travel freely to our most popular Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austrian Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to visit there for a little while.
For example, in Paris, Czechs slept in parks in tents, because our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of the travel of Czechs at this time was to drive their own food, canned food, sausages, etc. to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, which allows our tourists to finally buy the western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with that average salaries rose, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have regularly started preparing tours with charter air services since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper thanks to the possibility to negotiate quantity discounts compared to the past.
By the late 1990s, Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually all developed countries of the world, except the USA, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first ever direct charter flight to exotica was dispatched from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
From this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm distant countries, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100 thousand Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the USA revoked visas for Czech tourists and thus our country was definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%) and spent more than 15 thousand for one foreign holiday for the first time in their history, including the cost of their whereabouts. CZK per person.
The General Assembly is to find the chairman, but again there is a threat of stalemate
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman and threatens that Ivan Hašek’s successor at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which electoral order to proceed.
Without it, it will not even begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in leading Czech football.
Hašek resigned in June and, upon his departure, called on colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hašek, football slid back to the quarrels between the two union chambers, which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September, when the new President was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a method of election.
There was also no agreement on who actually has the right to vote in the pile - whether only the statutory representatives or even the functionaries entrusted with the power of attorney.
In this single point since then, there has been a partial agreement, which was also helped by the recommendation of the Institute for the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still disputes over the electoral order.
The executive committee, which no longer deals with anything else at its meetings, whether proper or extraordinary, has not brought much clarity into the situation.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in Round 3 to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FACR, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to make a concession to win a candidate who will get a higher sum of the percentage of the vote from both chambers.
And the Czech side enforces the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of the upper hand during this percentage census.
"But then the meaning of the two previous rounds would lose its meaning, it would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the statute-determined electoral rules suit Pelt the most of all candidates.
"I wish it was chosen according to the statutes at the most."
"So that some proxy nonsense is not invented, as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his remarks, defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be known in Nymburk and believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All passions will be reassured by the eventual progress of the national team at the European Championships today."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, there will be more willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience in managing football at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very torn."
"It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations on purpose."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete until the match.
The air special, in which the vice-chairmen of Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical disorder and a replacement option was sought to bring part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial-level meeting may be crucial, which could occur reportedly on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobeš would like to prompt the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to agree.
There is a lot in the game: the state subsidy, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight for the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If the head of football in Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, had seen a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have signed up for the fight for the top position.
"If a quality adept exists, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person," Paclík told the Czech News Agency.
Into the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is driven by the motivation to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the election, from going to the head of the FACR.
Paclík also points out that in the event of his victory, he would only last until 2013, when a regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In his position, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected with football.
"I've spoken to some people who would be considered."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Pallík is now most concerned about Pelt’s association with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the chair position.
"If he had won, the current state would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbro, who is a proficient trader, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name was heard years ago in interceptions during the investigation of the corruption affair, from which, however, Pelta came out unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football would bring to Pelt's victory."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is already taking his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman".
In the event that Paclík triumphs in Thursday's election, however, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco, is also thinking about the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the team."
"But managerially, he wouldn't be able to run the association."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who drew a lot of attention in September by dismissing a committee of judges headed by Luděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik says he would dare to lead the association.
He is referring to his skills from managing private companies, since last summer he also heads Pilsen, which with his support in May celebrated the first league triumph.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals committee, which goes into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider one of the priorities of the FACR’s relationship with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new chairman should address."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to say exactly where the money will go," he said.
As a burden, Paclík does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FACR should be "a non-partisan".
Pelta is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point in transferring my shares hypocritically to someone in a Pilsen club and returning there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FACR, which would exclude the electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make sure that the FACR should have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The Jablonecký official is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the eventual success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that he intends to concentrate on representing and obtaining finances if elected.
He decided to go to the last minute before the last general meeting, so he could use a two-month postponement to defend his ideas about managing football and present it in a broader context.
"People at every level have been doing football for a long time and expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"They feel it's high time someone led the association," says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who worked for many years in Sparta and the union's executive committee.
That is why he believes that he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the choice is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they didn't allow different interpretations, we've had the chairman since September," Pelta pointed out.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that conceived the delegates as a decoy.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta argues.
He said he was still trying not to define himself against his opponents.
He has previously announced that he can imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows full well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's already had some successes."
"His attacks, however, were unworthy and surprised a lot of people in the manner of the election campaign."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," Pelta said, adding that he remained loyal to the proclamations he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon, he said, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representation.
It should be the showcase of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the reverberations of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately afterwards, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole of football," the forty-six-year-old candidate told the Czech Press Agency two months ago.
He also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personnel cleansing.
"I would have to get acquainted with the content of the individual employees first," he said to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness about the long rulelessness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which are accompanied by the upcoming general meeting, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily on Thursday.
"If the only point of contention is how we will vote in the third round, then we can get over it."
"Football needs credibility, and it will only gain by finally having a leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the crucial day of her career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR would start working hard under it
If the current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl were elected the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday’s general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
It wants to push through systemic changes and make members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"I'm not saying I'm doing everything myself," Rajchl told ČTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to divide competences on the executive committee so that each of the members devotes themselves to a certain area."
"And I'm going to be handing out hard tasks to move football one mile forward in every segment of this."
"It probably wouldn't make many people happy because it would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I'm known to do 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it's going to make sense and that I'm not going to have people behind me who are constantly throwing sticks under my feet and questioning my every move," he explained, explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hašek.
"A lot of work has been done over the two years and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are started processes that will have a reverberation in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the time before Hašek.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him are primarily people who would make football so that he would be just for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but certainly not that I'm sidelining someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because then everyone will be well and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl commented.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
"Even though some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be a current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, was also involved in the fight for the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his achievements to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiate television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the contrary, he blames himself for the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he declares Pelt to be "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", he considers the other opponent Paclík a strong candidate who has a lot to offer football.
"No one can dispute that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If elected, he would hopefully continue with the things that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage," Rajchl evaluates rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jumping into the blue
Julia Stanek
A paddling pool from the perspective of Ufon, a sumptuous swimming pool in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after exploring cities or traveling, let your tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness by the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder embarked on discovery trips in the past one and a half years, her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the artistically shaped domes, swam opposite the marble putti (the figures of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) who waited for her on the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pool.
If she liked a swimming pool, she would carry it to her notebook in a flash - even with remarkable details about the way of building and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and present them now in her just published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming) ": People's Swimming Pools in Munich, the historical palaces of the swimming pools in the Schwarzwald," the hard core of concrete structures" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The Way to the Most Extraordinary Spa in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited localities in Italy, France, Bohemia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German woman is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sports, it doesn't exaggerate much, says Meder - just in the water it's something else.
To be angry, swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe intoxicating the smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says Mrs. Meder, a woman living in Vienna.
"So I started to gather nice swimming pools."
The water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in a jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the coziness factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of flooring, a man in a spa has a water surface."
"It's transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is visually doubled: high vault, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming) " provides in 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oases of wellness - but it arouses, above all, the desire to jump into blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by the collector of swimming pools, Ms. Meder, during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful spectacle. While a person has a whole city in his eyes from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, he can in the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton to watch the snow-covered Arlberg - a: In the steam baths there is a window from which it is possible to watch the rush on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most striking design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three up-open pans in winter rises steam while in the background of the mountain Ötztalu rises to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the collector of the pools Mrs. Meder stood the smell of chlorine in the nostrils.
Many thermal baths are smelled after sulfur, in the spa Árpád in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells of heating oil to the extent that one can barely believe that he got to the spa.
The smell comes from medicinal water containing alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black and whose deposits cling to the skin once only a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, she encountered a closed terrain.
In 1902, the design of the spa was closed by architect Dušan Jurkovič.
When Ms. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing massively between the tiles.
They built their demise, on the other hand, in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already completed three phases of construction; one can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements that date from the time of its creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was attached around r. 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for the connoisseur of the swimming pools, Mrs. Iris Meder, and not only because she comes from the Schwarzwald.
“It’s already some power to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex,” says Ms. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is apparently a marginal matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank to investigate commodity trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw consequences from this.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of those questioned even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of the trade because it is deepening the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study relies on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices up and therefore banks are complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley also act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were meant to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that participants in the capital market with an interest in high-risk trades have detached themselves from supply and demand - and made profits on behalf of the poorest.
Other than competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to investigate the criticisms, saying that no trade was "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is reviewing the complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is due to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors - along with a recommendation on how this should be handled.
At the end of January, the bank’s officials want to tell what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but intensified his criticism of the financial industry: “Betting on rising food prices shows, especially drastically, how ruthlessly banks today are detrimental to the common good.”
Let Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, live up to the duties.
"Deutsche Bank must cut from its portfolio all items that use money for food price bets," Bode said.
"It does not matter whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with the hunger-suffering people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group boss would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board would not switch to the supervisory board other than planned.
By turning away from the disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - his successor should deal with that in the end.
Every other person would terminate the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute inquired of 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Accordingly, eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments linked to food price bets.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such trades: Everyone else would terminate all investments for which money flows into speculation with raw materials as a result of the survey.
43 percent would warn acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said they would think about denunciating their account and switch to another institution.
The 21st Century House in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian Pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and desolated.
It is now being opened again as an exhibition house.
When it is horrified for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is an apt and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and lofty construction of steel and glass.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He became famous for the architect by building the pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key made by the secondary construction in Munich, 1973 became internationally famous.
His temporary exhibition building designed by the pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern Railway Station), reconstructed and in 1962 they opened the Museum of the 20th century - it was named as the "House of the 20th Century".
But suitable for the museum the building was neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art was given a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and decaying more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition there - a happy intention in every respect.
A new beginning by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduated art historian with a distinguished career, i.e. in her youth a figure skater, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, she strongly promoted the reconstruction of politicians and conservationists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore should be created, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, low budget.
To perform, then, Krischanitz was the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Schwanzer and the pavilion was a "immeasurably important place" for him, where he "almost every weekend" viewed exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness during its relocation to Vienna and the change of use.
There were far bigger problems during the current reconstruction: the building was a "catapult for energy," Krischanitz says.
The profiles of the windows of the glass facade were replaced, reinforced with insulating glass was used by glass fibers, and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridges-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been remediated.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
And the cinema hall is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the heritage office and the low budget.
"Often material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the heritage office," Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to be difficult with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-History."
Such architecture is said to stand "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "arouse proper self-confidence."
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, because an urban happy coincidence has happened: In the circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City District near the Main Station" with office and residential houses is being created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: the 21st-century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear it, is already negotiating with the city about the neighborhood at the Schweizer Garten site.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis at a million dollar level
The track has picked up a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That will cost millions.
In the fight against winter caused by train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing another 70 million euros in the newspaper this year, according to the report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported provisionally, citing an internal group plan, that a total of around 300 million euros is expected to be made by 2015.
It is said to achieve better use of trains and the rail network in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16 000 people to remove snow on railway equipment and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches over the course of four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the railways, Rüdiger Grube, warned after a meeting at the highest level with representatives of the government and industry against train blackouts and delays also during this winter.
In the last winter period, the track in passenger transport had significant problems, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
This is how numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
This is also due to delays in the operation of ICE trains
The track has also not been able to handle the fact that the axles of ICE trains must probably be more often inspected in a workshop when one ICE train at Köln Central Station has been subjected to axle destruction.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fine in US
After the commotion surrounding boss Josef Ackermann, new trampots are taking place in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the giant in the industry caught up in its past in the US: The Frankfurt institution pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in one compensation procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage certificates.
The financial market regulator of the NCUA blames a number of large banks for having seduced cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they probably reduced the risks.
Such papers have lost considerable value during the crisis and tore the banks with them into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we could resolve the issue without the need to drag the parties to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt by the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which is committed to paying out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the friendliness of the two money institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is relevant to cooperative banks in the U.S. and helps in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is attempting to recover compensation for the billion-dollar damages incurred.
Now the completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also clamped down on other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
For questionable mortgage certificates, these are the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the American bubble around the properties in r. 2007 collapsed, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mindset.
Although the events occurred a few years ago, there is now a sharp wind blowing through the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to remedy or to impede wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He blames 18 international big banks for two state-run U.S. real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals of about $200bn.
Also, Deutsche Bank must face a FHFA lawsuit, with more deals totalling about US$14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be liable for "substantial losses" without, of course, stating an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT-enterprise.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the unimanent American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will be difficult to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had previously had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for IT-departments of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight-making in the financial world.
As a result, IBM's mother rock can now be called "Sir IBM."
Because Buffett revealed on US economic radio station CNBC that he had bought US$10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's biggest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte that even IBM knew nothing about his involvement yet.
He praised the management, who even sought proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT services such as computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has rather avoided tech companies to this day.
It claims to invest only in businesses whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight railway, the lubricant manufacturer or the machine products.
His Berkshire Hathaway holding also owns shares in a range of large-scale subsidiaries such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the world's most valuable businesses with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent before the stock market started.
The "Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange and is considered to be the most valuable technology enterprises in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so much for Buffett, he wouldn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his intimate friend.
The threat is tangible
After the revelation of the "Cell in Zwickau," Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
The newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was responded to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For for many German Turks, this brings back the specter that has long been considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992, and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there was xenophobia in Germany, however, there was never any doubt about it.
The discovered right-wing extremist network, however, reveals a scale whose dimension can no longer be seen.
"Is the bloody ideology coming to life again?" were the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah," on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the department's protection of the constitution and fears that also German authorities could be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted deliberately: It was remembered over the weekend by a demonstration of silence in front of the Brandeburg Gate of the victim of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the ceremonial act of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, life together was staged - as a history of success.
The news of several Turkish media outlets is a slap in the face: "Germany's 50th birthday gift" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murderous series.
Also, the publication of the "Hürriyet" for Germany newspaper is not to be taken from carrying out this thought connection.
"It's starting to smell," reads the headline of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
Most critically, the procedure of the police and its late success in the search are discussed in the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for the suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus many are demonstrated at least rhetorically prompt to use drastic means: "If activity is continued to be carried out here so superficially, there will be nothing left for immigrants but their own defense and arming."
"That might be the best self-defense."
"On the quality of the clarification and adequacy of the punishment of the whole network, internal peace in Germany depends very strongly," writes "Selen."
What does it mean, if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain.
The photo of the burnt-out site in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and a German, that distrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
However, the assassinations made the Turks' more apparent sense of reciprocity.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the assassinations was criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln, who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent his condolences to the Turkish state president, but he was represented at the funeral ceremony in Köln by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel calculated in his speech what fees the Turks were handing over.
Quite as if the value of a man was measured according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local state law arrangement is.
In addition to efforts to clarify extensively and a new assessment of right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
The scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German has to make it up.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would take a near-as spectacular new job in 2013: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss Grand Bank of UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicly, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved a turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was already clear in September that everything would turn out very differently.
One dealer from UBS in London bypassed all of the bank's security systems and frowned around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board of directors has also been scalded ever since - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May - not just in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an issue banker, and he would certainly need time to incorporate.
At once, he will take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title of "Bank of the Biggest Scandals in Europe"
For UBS is huge, until recently, the largest wealth manager in the world - and has been gliding for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, will the proud Swiss bank be spared.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputations.
The image of a silent and solid but also cunning wealth manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world's biggest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, recounts: "I always mentioned UBS as a role model for a good bank for my students back then."
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong considerably.
In 2007, it was obvious for the first time that something had gone properly wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, the head of the board, Peter Wuffli, who was still considered a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To keep it going, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
But she found investors, but one that would have recently turned her nose: the Opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first bump.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second-highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, disaster followed: UBS was behind the financial crisis due to its flawed investments and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs to mandatory exchangeable bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for it noticed how dramatic it was for a small country when it had such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times greater than that of Switzerland's economy (see figure).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” says Geiger, a banking expert.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS has capitulated this in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, cut taxes with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as a return of unjustified profits from these trades, including a penalty mark-up.
In doing so, UBS became more or less open that it had helped cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it had been.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, over the course of several months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking due to poor speculation and in wealth management for aiding tax cuts.
And just when it calmed down a little bit, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered, this unfortunate business analysis came in: A single dealer had wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with investment banking risk management, it's probably still not going well.
“The Adoboli case probably found that the risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanz professor of finance at the Zürich University Banking Institute.
Also, the chief financial officer of a large German bank is certain: "The problem with UBS is that it can't handle risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had advanced a long time ago, to become guards of the great property of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - also from this side the Alpine Republic collapsed again.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakeable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the clichés of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Bahnhofstraße, Zurich, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry shops like Tiffany's can be found here among the Swiss traditional shops like the Sprüngli pastry shop.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
A heavy revolving door enters the reception hall of UBS.
Inside are walls lined with marble, in front of them stand massive leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank a large direction to the "sejf".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
However, this idea of the Swiss bank by the two Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He would rather not read his name in the newspapers, eventually closing, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks of business.
UBS has probably got too biger, it finds out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about it.
"And if they had, they had adapted to Anglo-Saxon manners long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS changed, brought it high profits at first and then a disaster: No European financial institute had lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Großbank.
15. October 2008 the disaster was evident.
"On that Wednesday, the governing coalition of the small seven million-strong country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros have been approved by politicians to save a large bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into a massive group.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, it helped that the two different bank predecessors of UBS complemented themselves: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a wealth of wealth management and poorer but more internationally heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came advantageously to a lot of money, with which they could spin a large roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors, from 2001 to 2007.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble one who knows a lot about the models and the statistics and Ospel, the person following the feelings around the stomach, who has evolved completely from the banking science."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli towards the end.
And Wuffli probably made the decisive mistake at the end: "He probably thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
The clear thing is: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly recall the meetings of executives at which the group's chief executive, Wuffli, repeated the same slogan over and over again: Bringing Goldman Sachs down the throne.
The US bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She listed "League Tables," a waiting list documenting the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS tried to place it completely above.
She had already taken a few steps.
In the trade in foreign exchange and shares, she participated in the game at the top.
But corporate advisers who have been in charge emphasize one weakness: In international interest rate trade, in the speech of "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a great distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close that gap, UBS committed to an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its established fund invested in securing risks in U.S. Subprime investments.
It developed into a massive machine that changed the securities to U.S. mortgage loans and passed on - but also retained the risks itself.
Also, when other banks were long over the way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, that's where UBS was buying," says banking expert Geiger.
How big the euphoria is, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a catapult seat and are still swinging to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They need to find a strategy for a bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End with investment banking, concentration on wealth management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to decline strongly, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the bank's new chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: He is due to run UBS's business for a long time, the Zurich-based bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
Publicly, however, he only says that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of a recession in Europe is weighing on the US stock exchange.
The impending recession in Europe has deprived U.S. investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended strike effect.
The subdued production of industry on the Continent has suffocated in the bud of hope of stabilizing the debt crisis.
Universal facilitation by exchanging government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced
The euro fell against the dollar.
Italian and Greek glass in the past week has been considered half full, not half empty - but now problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales tickets.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values recorded a 0.6 percent drop to the end of trading at 12,078 points.
During trading, the market barometer swung between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The Breadth of the S&P-500-Index ended at 1251 points, a decline of one percent.
The Nasdaq tech stock exchange's index lost 0.8 percent and pulled out of trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax parted ways with a decline of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
Industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and prepared to end the boom.
Businesses produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
This has tuned investors in the U.S. skeptically. "We're not an island, we're addicted," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe will probably not recover so quickly from the recession, moreover, there are other signs of the weakness of the banks.
Warren Buffett's legend of investing only confirmed this outlook: He said in one CNBC-interview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything possible to end the crisis.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the several decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars at IBM boosted the share price of a traditional group and let it be quoted almost one percent against the trend during trading.

Smart crows expand in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problematic birds": but these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been in the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities there are complaints of residents about dirt and noise caused by animals.
There is no means of in sight against "problematic birds".
The field ravens may no longer be expelled from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted about possible starting points.
Looking for alternatives in cities
At the same time, conservationists derived the problems of cities also from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
The pursuit, growing development and felling of typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are, among others, in Soesto, West, West, among others, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, 2005 sparked a contentious project of mass killing of crows in a rural county negative headlines.
Critics have called the capture of animals into bird traps and the killing of sticks particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, scaring, nothing brings," so found the urban planner and landscaper Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environment expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Badensk-Württemberg.
"The animals are retreating, the great colonies are splitting and dividing into other places."
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception for hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expulsion of animals from sensitive living areas and their attraction is conceivable to settle in other places.
"Information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One sound in the face can eventually be best overcome with self-confidence."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded the Scholeswig-Holstein Ascherberg Nature Road, on which information boards provide lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have already been accepted by tourists.
Also, Ms. Jürgens had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Field Ravens use not only aids to reach a treat, but even make their instrument as an aid.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior on four field ravens as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring the stones to the collapse of the structure in order to get to the larvae of the pier.
Without much training, they recognized what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In the vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with the larvae of the pier.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the researchers put pieces of wire in there.
From them, all four animals shaped a hook, which, like a hood, hunted the container from the pipe behind the handle.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do so even with a lock.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for 2012 European Championship
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not work out.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoffs.
Leading the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) defeated Portugal Bosnia-Hercegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth appearance in the first match in a row perfect for the European Championship.

Neither did Croatia score with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Velos (80th) scored more goals for Portugal.
A former Wolfsburg professional from the Zvjezdan Misimovic Federated League with a converted penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice downgraded for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was given a yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo soon took the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 metres into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in shooting over a long distance and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not perform in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
The former Wolfsbur player from England at the head of the Manchester City table set the ball header on the bottom edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood in the centre.
After a crackdown against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.).
On the opposing side, Stark made a disputed penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentraa, who Misimovic confidently converted.
But after the break, the European vice-master from r. 2004 with four hits.
Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
With that, the European champion leaves r. 1976 for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
Team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the initial stage.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goalkeeper Tomáš Sivok (9.) reflexively at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest options when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a turn from the boundary of the penalty area just past Cech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked-down goalkeeper of the Czechs of the world class, again reduced the striker FC Seoul (50.).
Shortly before the end, the goal finally cleared everything up.
Turkey missed a footballing miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost confidently release his place on the bench of the third in the 2002 World Cup, the Croats are allowed to rejoice in their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairy-tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the stick in the seventh minute with a shot from distance, striker Kazim also unable to hang the deflected ball in goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took over, but still to a greater extent control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get a goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who was releasing Dortmund's Ivan Perisice from the 62nd minute, the legionnaires from the Federal League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took the lead in the 32nd minute with a 4:0 success in the first game.
Konstantin Vassilev (57.) equalized for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian defence prevented a possible leading goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was quite far away.
After a failed defence of goalie Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to a 1:0 state.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
SAP, the largest software manufacturer in Europe, will invest billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
To r. 2015 will bring in around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros), the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and employ the relevant staff," announced Deputy Chief Executive Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The staff is now expected to grow from the current 2500 employees to 4500.
The number of branches of the world's leading software for businesses will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the global more than 176 000 SAP customers are booming in the country.
Growth plans in China are also an important building block of Dax’s strategy for r. 2015.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book, Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with such a long list of performing characters that you get dizzy.
One piece of advice on how to behave at that moment: Carefully rip this page out and make a bookmark of it.
You will get to know all the people very well in Mr. Englund's novel story, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "antihistorical work."
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, but rather "a book about what it was like." It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" combines the wartime experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of fates, while others quench.
Mr. Englund's book is different from classic historical novels.
It regulates the notion that the First World War was just about the fearsome trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and grief" explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that bee nests fall on them, have to spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids or deal with the presence of the flies tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning, it is a very moving read.
War will engulf people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
When gunfire starts in the distance and you're a woman who's at home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually coming?
Hardly anyone understands what's going on, not even why the whole war was unleashed.
"The vacuum created from the lack of facts," Mr. Englund observed, "was filled with conjecture, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are generally taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound both terrifying and engaging, but by the inclusion of small moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with hardship and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Substitutes, substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee substitute, imitation of aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and supplemented with a fake bone made of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds inner impulses for wildness and brutality, and then declares the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is the human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book, and pretend that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no barbarian hiding behind the starchy self inside."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon, and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
"When one finally accepts that he is sacrificing himself, he would at least expect it to happen in the sight of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like "a convict who is secretly hanged."
Other remarks relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and competitive struggle," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "the new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a tailor-made dress that performs his bloodshed without rising from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, deceit alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some STD from prostitutes to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the gonococopus trafficking, which soldiers bought and rubbed their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate people rubbed him in the eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk, but not flashy, which is perfect for his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way the war "unleashed completely unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly rather than with a complex narrative worked with hints, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels like "On the Western Front Calm" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming endings, which are unprecedented in popular literature.
But I will not tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from your list of heroes from your hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this time for a minute a precisely planned raid
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at the time.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers. The others were first told it was an exercise.
The action was led by police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
There were no repeats of cases from recent weeks, when, for example, pepper sprays against protesters were used, thus breaking the rules of the department and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the side of the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation, which aimed to clean up the Zuccotti park from the protesters, was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
A massive exercise in case of behavior in crisis situations took place in the part of Randalls Island, which was a preparation for the event in Zuccotti Park.
Lead officials intensified so-called training to suppress the riots - anti-terrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of large numbers of police officers - with a focus on the city's Lower Manhattan district.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" declared someone to whom the event was originally explained only as "exercise."
"I know a few police officers who were also called into this action, and they were definitely not told that Zuccotti Park was going," said the person, who spoke only on condition that he remained anonymous.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to Zuccotti Park."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already received once.
14. In October, the city officials planned to clean up the park, but then they backed away from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them flocked to the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the neighborhood - dozens of police officers, who are routinely used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people came to the park during the day and went again, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there will be as few people as possible in the park," he declared.
Before the troops set off, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
Lights and recorded news roaring from the amplions have frightened many protesters.
When members of the riot squads entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many protesters packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack their things.
Other teams of police officers were spotted gathering on the edge of the park so they could break into it if any arrests needed to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Chief Spokesperson of the Police Department Paul J. Browne said that was the case for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers treated them rudely.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street leading along the park's western border could film without difficulty.
Police were moving westwards and weaving through a thick twitch of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes. Behind them came teams from the hygiene department, which immediately raked everything that was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting the image materials appeared on the Internet moments later.
The most obscure group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their campground, which lay near the center of the park.
Some created a roadblock, and the police began their methodological arrests.
About ten people in the center of the campsite chained each other to each other.
And two people tied themselves to a tree, Mr Kelly said.
Emergency services members were called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 a.m., no arrests were made in the park, Mr Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the statement from the police said.
Mr Browne said approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "organization of rioting and resisting in arrests," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the detective commander in the department.
Mr Kelly was present but "did not participate in the management of the operation," Mr Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called in.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, roadblocks were erected.
From these places, the police then unfurled the protective belt even further from the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers were spotted, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people even further beyond that border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o'clock in the morning, one protester was spotted south of Pine Street as he jumped on the hood of a police car, and several others were letting air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Union of Assistant Workers will sue the city over dismissal
Unions representing hundreds of school auxiliary workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. He argues that redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, discrimination was due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court case is probably the last option left to the unions in District Council 37 in their bid to reverse the decision on layoffs.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other staff who were among the city's worst-paid staff lost their jobs. Their dismissed union leaders described it as retribution for not allowing it access to a health care fund managed by work crews last spring, through which the city wanted to tape a hole in the budget.
City officials have categorically rejected the allegations.
At a town council meeting held last month, Education Minister Dennis M. said. Walcott that the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the council immediately countered that the budget did not specifically mention the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
District Council 37 officials said they had already filled in the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him. They will call a press conference on Wednesday, where they will formally announce a lawsuit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight redundants, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as will most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would therefore not comment on the individual charges.
Under the motion for a complaint, which the New York Times managed to get, the unions focused on the amount of those released in poor parts of the city, thereby seeking to support their claims of unfair conduct. They are of the opinion that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island section were not released at all, and in the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, even 46 assistants were fired.
At the School of Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, despite a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "This is not a neighborhood full of wealthy parents who can procure funds to offset the deficit in the budget."
The school's budget for Public School 36 was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated bonus finances for each registered poor student.
Among other things, the unions say high school principals may have been confused by the way a document was written approving the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school payroll to the database of available workers whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been laid off," the complaint's proposal reads, "and not just moved to the database for the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept a deal on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of U.S. troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Commission will decide on a statement backed by Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and American troops to thank them for their "bravery."
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun the reconstruction of their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences mentioned may look innocent, but no debate that has been about Libya has been easy until now.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides were constantly arguing with the White House about the wording of a series of declarations for approval or, conversely, rejecting the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House because of the differences between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would stop funding U.S. operations in Libya.
This put the U.S. mission in Libya literally in a legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but apparently it didn't irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The Congress's hesitancy eventually overtook other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and 20. Gaddafi was killed in October.
The Nato mission officially ended 31. October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In a statement, the International Relations Commission "congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity, which they have expended in trying to liberate their people" and "commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population, for extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal win the full support of the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be divided again into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June proposal?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief representative on the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
There will be a vote in the House this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, enforced by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the First Amendment to the Constitution relating to the budget or other topic on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, despite considerable efforts, other legislators have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that were presented in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some were the same - the same proposal put forward to both the House and Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
In the House alone, at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful can be found that would like to "regulate federal spending."
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents - especially aspiring Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorship."
The revenue for budget regulation, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss limiting the number of periods in which members of the congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods he may be in office as president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a variety of additions that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage and an amendment prohibiting the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in designing various amendments, they do not differ significantly from the average compared to previous years.
At 111. Congress offered 77 amendments, while at 100. Congress was 66.
Their activity even fades compared to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after being injured from point-blank range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying she was more than about returning to Congress to recover.
Giffords appeared on the show's "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was obvious that the creation of sentences was still causing her problems and she needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of the bullet wound that punched her skull in front, penetrated the left half of her brain and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to take a triumphant part in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, forty-one-year-old Giffords replied: "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special episode of the show's "20/20," which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special has tracked Gifford's entire recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos, which Kelly shot during the first week, Giffords can be seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can't do more than just lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teaching her how to perform simple activities.
Nodding your head.
Lips embuzzling.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords had uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman sings on them, along with a therapist, to the melodies of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she didn't remember anything from the day the shooting took place.
Her husband said Gifford was reading newspaper articles about the shooting on March 12, when she first asked him who the six were who was killed in the incident.
The shooting is suspected by Jared Lee Loughner, who is being detained at a prison in Missoury, where, under the influence of violently administered drugs, he is awaiting trial.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife said during her convalescence, "I lost."
"So I immediately said to her, "Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly captioned the question.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, you get together and come back even stronger than ever."
Military units are faced with compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for New York war veterans who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines gathered around him.
A festively dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Both the men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who held the spring benefit.
The ceremony was also attended by the then chairman of the committee of the chiefs of staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was also on the scene, but he saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect. It was regret.
Thus, the completely opposite impressions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is boundlessly included in praise for its sacrifices.
But this praise costs something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they regret the individual in uniform.
"We're not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B said. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But the only way some people can support us seems to be to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for army commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to ruin the relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that troops once returned from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat operations where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people outside the army would be watching their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and amazement, because they defeated enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But he will wonder if "there is an evil, violent veteran under the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and took his place in Washington's government upon his return.
He argued that when he was looking for a job, some of the people interviewing him were quietly implying whether, so soon after returning with combat, he could withstand the stress associated with working in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military's concern stems in part from America's indifference to wars.
Successes in the battlefield rarely reap recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own military and finds little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it used to be in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition from politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to crack down hard on rape
It will decide this week whether the trial of 28 women and men against the military will be launched over alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other petitioners are prepared to file the lawsuit.
The private first class of Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her colleague in the Army and was at 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could be joined, that they could drink a little in her room.
"There was a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought: No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
He claims that just minutes after they walked into her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will await a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and will be about whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to justice.
The allegations state that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charge was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. Over the next few months, however, their number grew to between 28 and 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military failed to investigate, punish and pursue justice after the announcement of these wefts.
Burke says she's after the highest-ranking army commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to impose measures against such acts? The High Command."
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping up all the charges in this case - she stacked all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says - she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if needed to keep the pressure from subsiding.
The team defending the Department of Defense is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who along with his associates filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense's strategy - in principle, the point is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for the injuries they sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries sustained by active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is just a matter of vocabulary: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers fell - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
It's time for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight. In addition to her, three other attorneys are involved in the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for supposedly developing an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
Independently of this, the nonprofit organization of American Vietnamese veterans collects the basis for its lawsuit against the military. The lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of a "personality disorder" that was allegedly detected in rape victims so that the military would have an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, who belonged to the group of human rights activists of the Service Women's Action Network, this is a perfectly common practice.
Her group had already filed a motion in December to bring a lawsuit against a state-run veterans-related organization, which it accuses of discriminatory practices that were supposed to have been handled by requests for assistance by those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted on duty.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented, presented by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties, proposing a variety of corrective measures in them.
According to the Defense Department's Office for the Prevention and Resolving Sexual Violence, 3 158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this number is equivalent to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in a given year.
The report issued in March also discusses the level of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military came to court - half of the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks only as the first of a number of traumas.
The first-class private Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to have occurred.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and in her bed the blood of the attacker was found - from the wound she had done to his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman had a court hearing during which questions were asked about whether she was making love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned to testify in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was handed down," Ms. Lyman says.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there on the spot - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer: This was not his trial. He was mine."
The Lymans ordered her to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her unfit to serve.
In January 2010 she was released from the army without honor and therefore without the right to retirement.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors moves to the next stage or not, it's a run for the long haul, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to progress to the next stages of discussion."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The military is several decades behind because their duties do not give in to comply with the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds: "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burkevoá, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to file a lawsuit and begin work on further cases relating to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the military on this issue, where reform will not come from," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Explore You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who pleaded guilty to the July murderous rampage, after which 77 people were left in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on the social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them wasn't really that hard at all," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently released report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The Facebook store is so extensive, says Bartlett, that it was enough for scientists to simply use the advertising on the site and, thanks to this, with absolute accuracy, determine the desired demographic group - something that marketing staff have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, whereupon they focused their attention and sent them advertisements. However, instead of inviting them into a newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they called on them to complete a questionnaire that raised questions about their level of education, relationship to violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a whole new way of conducting research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are annoyed by the rising level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism even with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding status updates, posts on walls, and pressed "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data on a daily basis, which makes this social network literally an "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers in whose name the word Facebook appears has risen to nearly 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be true that when you wanted to conduct a survey among the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to a side where you'd never be let go," Bartlett says.
"This is what Facebook breaks down - you just go straight to them."
Others say the site can offer a way to identify and avoid the social-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outputs on Facebook were far more at risk for the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent on the subject.
Moren suggests that peers of students monitor the site and come up with an offer of help to a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved if you can't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Child Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise have no chance of discovering."
Facebook is constantly probing its users’ data.
The information team of the website has prepared statistics on the context of relational statuses and St. Valentine's Day, turnout in 2010 and the coefficient of satisfaction of the nation (mainly using the information to which they had access - proponents of Internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure available to others).
But Facebook users know that the page tracks them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the page needs to be provided with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users even thought that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it that the information was just between them and their friends."
Then consider the question of methodology.
Even in off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, those are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on off-line."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to orchestrating two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he declared outside the court, where 500 people gathered.
"I raise an objection to the Court of Justice because the mandate has been granted to you by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess my actions, but I confess no guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a ready-made speech with him, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned from having any contact with the media for 4 weeks and announced that the final authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept tightly locked up.
All participated in the aim of moving the case to an early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told the NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved back a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When coming and going to the building without difficulty, looking into the eyes of the journalists and survivors.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he is part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge has suggested he is not insane, noting that there is no evidence that he has any co-conspirator.
For some, it can be a comfort that the attacks of 22. June seems to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminish the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she'd fall out like a creature, but that's not the case," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If it did, everything would be much easier."
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to cinemas this week
Once Steve Jobs 5. He died in October, the opinions of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear - and they chose him as his genius The greatest modern inventor.
In a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was dusted off for a special movie heading to the cinemas this week, Apple fans will be the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who fits every little thing to the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] there is still a long way to do a lot of work between a great idea and a great final product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than hour-long interview took place.
It was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and looked impatiently at how the general public would adopt the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone famous for his distaste for giving longer interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also proves to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the conversation, there will be a longer pause between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs perfectly thinks the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when Cringely’s questions are impatient and drive him to get to more important issues and topics more quickly.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and there are terrifyingly prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and badly, offering their own vision for the future in the field of computer technology.
It's one thing to read through the posthumous assessments of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It was not long before he expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"During the years of business, I've always asked: Why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks deeply about business-related things.
I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was utterly confused about the way the costs were recorded - they often began with the inscription "standard costs," their amount could only be guessed. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic instrument that guaranteed that they could determine the trade costs in a moment.
How he performed the rioting on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
A number of devices have been written about this in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally contagious.
They tell how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and allowed themselves to be switched from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times we've been intertwined around the world like this, so when we shouted something on a paid phone, it came from the other phone at the door a minute later," Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we found ourselves able to build a thing that is capable of managing billions of dollars worth of infrastructure around the world."
We made two of us a little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been born without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the joke, which he and Wozniak almost made the end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could speak to the Pope, impersonating Henry Kissinger in the best possible way.
Gradually, more and more senior members of the Catholic Church were called to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke the pope himself to the phone, the pair chuckled and put the receiver down.
How he fell in love with technology (and made a phone call with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett's number in his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a secured summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"She influenced me incredibly. It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my perspective on what such a company was and how it was supposed to treat its employees.”
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I was moving higher and higher in HP, hanging around that computer and starting to write programs for it.
How he invents innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during an interview about how he invents new products on the fly.
In the early days of his career, when he went out to sell a pair of printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 days paid, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember arguing quite wildly... they were shouting at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost 300 USD] until I got tired of it, I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for 15 USD.
How much of a breath is running out for large companies:
Long before he led the resurgence of Apple, Jobs far-sightedly predicted that many industry leaders would waver in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's just say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copiers or printers, so what next?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company could no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are already in charge of companies, while people in charge of their own products are excluded from the decision-making process.
The technological genius who has led the company to its unshakeable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it is, it could have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
Instead of winning, however, they made a loss.
How he takes innovation as a form of art:
"There is still a long way to go between a great idea and a great final product... and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - certain things simply electrons, glass, robots or factories you do not force.
You have to keep 5 000 things in mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
Ultimately, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to reflect them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they could do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the health care law at a time when their case was being dealt with by the court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm that will take part in the hearings before the court.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submitted motions.
One of the cases being discussed was a lawsuit brought by 26 states questioning the radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year - a bill that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit. However, a 5.5-hour meeting is expected in March, the outcome of which will further stir up the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be underway at the time of the decision.
The lawyer, who will stand before the court and seek to pass the law, will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General under George W. Bush. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has been engaged in the defense of conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the law, the so-called. The National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for whom huge funds are at stake in the process.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican official in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the health care bill, also attended.
And the guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: This pair of judges have been participating in the Federalist Society's actions for years.
And it's certainly not anything that's inconsistent with the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the principles of conduct by which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their behaviour would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in actions that the related and other organizations hold for the purpose of obtaining the funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor must he be listed on the agenda."
Yet Scalia and Thomas's relationship with two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, said in a statement.
"The judges were drinking and dining on the social benefit together with the legal representatives who are waiting to hear their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the feet with all claims of non-bias, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy for their critics and told them that they also seamlessly combined their judicial obligations with actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to renounce her involvement in the case, arguing that she fought for the law so much then than she could now be unbiased.
Kagan didn't indicate that she was going to step down.
Boeing has won a record order for jet aircraft worth US$18 billion
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jet aircraft with the option of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner jets to Aman Air, for which it collects more than US$1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a total of US$18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important is where Boeing won the contract from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,50 US$450 billion in the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its largest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-aisle jet Boeing 777s.
The sensational contract came from Dubai-based Emirates.
Boeing told the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline has the option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to US$26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds US$1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-mining nations.
This means that they have not only money to pay for planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging airlines because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so crucial because the country itself earns higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines could cancel or delay aircraft orders because of fuel price increases, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from Emirates consolidates Boeing’s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS into the tight, trying to undermine Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350 jet, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, will be postponed.
The displacement took place because customers demanded more load and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more engine power.
The price of Boeing Co's actions rose by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
The Mexican president's sister was apparently defeated in the Michoacan election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of PRI, was helped in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost in a violent state election for the post of governor in Michoacán. On Monday, she said one of her opponents had been helped to victory by drug traffickers.
The preliminary results attributed the leadership in the governorship elections of the western state to Fausto Vallej of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interference of the members of organized crime in the whole electoral process, and especially in the course of the election itself yesterday, is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview with the radio station a day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion polling group... They confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks... and let people vote to order for PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
However, he is planning an early return to power, and victory in the election in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the July presidential election as well.
It seems that Vallejo beat Calderon, who still led very closely the day before the election.
Calderon, the candidate for the conservative party of her brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, declined to recognize Vallejon as a winner.
Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has been the leader of the Democratic Revolution Party. For a quarrelsome and unlucky persecuted party, it is a very unfortunate defeat before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also declined to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state's capital, named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been in control of drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of PAN, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election, and many of the candidates resigned from the election out of fear.
However, whatever the results of the election in Michoacán look for the PRI party, winning will help the party gain a new impetus.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, of Wahington congratulated Vallej, saying: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB urges Asia to help save Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of Asia's economies.
Rajat Nag, CEO of ADB, based in Manila, said the world's two fastest growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the currency bloc's rapid recovery through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries were following all European difficulties "too unexcitedly" and declared that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and resources, would help ignite the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So it suits anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they definitely should do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for several months by a severe debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have stepped down.
Europe's growing debt crisis has raised fears that it could bring the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to emerge that newly booming leading economies will come together to help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that mutual assistance - such as the purchase of bonds of the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, the institution for European financial stability - would provide greater bargaining opportunities for Asian partners of European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a dry-up of the tributary of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he declared.
"We are facing a tough task and we must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as the Indian one, have nothing to help European economies when forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion people of India when 800 million of them live on USD 2 or less per day.
"Someday they might find that the Greeks retire at fifty and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain to them," he said.
Lee Howell, the director-general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian supplies should be used to keep good-paying jobs to many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis threatens a "dangerous domino effect."
The bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% of economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a "risk of decline" because of a European threat.
He declared that vulnerable emerging markets must create "plans for unpredictable spending" to protect them from declines and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta put the bill under Congress on Monday when he warned that the looming automatic cuts in the budget could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a budget cut of US$450 billion over the next decade, but now fears a reduction of an additional US$600 billion if Congress fails to strike a spending deal.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress's inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment will cause a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this imprescussive way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can't buy just three quarters of a building or a ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is expected to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our military and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, the cuts will also affect combat troops, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this bypass, the operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts even in the contract staff, which will result in delays in agreed contracts supporting the war efforts of our people."
"The status of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both senators wrote Panett off ten days ago, asking him for details regarding the potential impacts on automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of the shutdown at the Department of Defense could cause rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly opposed to this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"We will only see if Panetto's letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and intensify votes calling to omit the Pentagon from the list of cut areas.
Panetta has been increasingly open in talks about possible cuts lately, even though he has moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was embarking on a tough fight.
At a press conference held this week, the defense minister hinted at a brief picture of what his resort might expect - the shell of the army, inside which, however, the core will be missing.
"He'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"He will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of the Pentagon speech.
"He will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to match a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In the annex, with a letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibilities of airborne and deployments around the world; a presumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be expected to be terminated, including those already tested, and those that are still in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the project of the F35 aircraft, a planned new bomber, a new next-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal combat ship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and Marines wanted to replace the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save US$80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which needs to be dealt with by the country with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A glimpse of recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy alleging that he has sexually harassed several women - both sides claim the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach sexually assaulted the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught saying with a microphone down he called U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie was able to destroy entire careers and obscure the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he released information that was immediately disproved by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of abusing funds from his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that broke down around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories everywhere about cheating in school and university.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers, just to look good in their assessments themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lie and deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that in a single day, you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of the first encounter in their lives.
Determining lies, or "lies recognition," is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar to, say, Charade, when a person shouts, "I have you." Deceit recognition is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're stuttling, stuttering, blushing or sewing themselves up.
However, do not infer from the fact that it is somehow difficult to spot and detect liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, a way of creating questions and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and emerging industry related to the recognition of lies, and it is clear that deceiving deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can help you greatly in today’s complex world – especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, conducting interviews, negotiating, or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in their alertness, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women say more of the lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say are usually "outrageous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “initial observation.”
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding of something to compare.
Notice the posture of the subject, his laughter, working with his voice.
You should know if someone is routinely constantly tapping their feet so that you don't wrongly accuse him of lying just because he starts tapping his foot in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, take this only as warning signs, not as evidence of lies.
People uttering a lie can stop moving through the upper half of their body when trying to remember their made-up story, can turn the tips of their shoes to the door, lean to the exit, significantly change the posture or show "relief after the conversation" - an exaggerated relieved sigh and change of position when there is a difficult confession behind them.
People conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what relief will look like after it is over.
Also see the subject’s language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once misspoke and used past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which ran a nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals can also express themselves in a measured way: "I have had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or the difficult question will be repeated.
The most common verbal features are very small.
Someone can use a lot of "mitigating language" when they answer the difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such an answer, we do not learn much of the facts, and often it is another warning sign.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire skills by which to trace a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of not falling for a liar and a fraud in his personal and work.
The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delaying approval by the U.S. government emerged
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thereby pitting unions against each other but reassuring environmentalists - the company in charge of building the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project so that things would get moving again.
TransCanada announced on Monday night that it would move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada's student Alex Pourbax argues that the company is confident that eventually the construction of the pipeline will be approved despite leading a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was delaying a decision on the federal permission of the project, from where it will not conduct studies of possible replacement routes through which it would be possible not to intervene in the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the water-bearing layer of Ogalla, a vast underground water supply.
"This is really a move forward," Republican Rep Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental opinion ordered by the Foreign Ministry would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year's elections, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a State Department request and expressed his support for him.
The 1,700-mile-long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, 700 000 barrels of oil flow through it every day.
This will require 6 countries to cross this path.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work crews who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
But lawmakers in Nebraska opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallaa aquatic layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the environmental impact commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the inspector general from the ministry had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, and focused mainly on two issues.
Once was whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, was not a conflict of interest on the program.
Another then, whether the firm that was hired to conduct the original study was not elected inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of turning on fears because of her toddler
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle burst into the lobby of their Manhattan home and terrified their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The performance of the singer of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared the eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family claims in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, the stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk met her luggage down into the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I left to pick her up"
LaBelle rebuked the pregnant woman irritably.
"In an aggressive tone, she said, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,"" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She became angry and began to speak dirty - shouting loudly the most vulgar expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her and started splashing water from it.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter,"" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who subsequently dragged her into the waiting car, was told by Roseanna Monk.
The daughter, meanwhile, was screaming so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no answers.
The lawyer and spokeswoman of the singer LaBelle do not respond to our phone calls to comment on the whole case.
The lawsuit is demanding unspecified compensation, but family attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child in her arms."
Climate adversity has hampered the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's rule, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, and foreign investment declined, and with it the economy
2011 will be in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the reign of Mario López Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government has brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures have caused million-dollar losses in agriculture, limiting the growth of the state economy, and reducing economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. There was a historic decline of 31.16% in agriculture, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partial damage. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a steady rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state saw an increased increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55 053 residents of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing a unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose to 5.28%, and between July and August, average unemployment continued to rise, reaching 6.19%, representing around 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed people increased by 18 969 people.
Less liquidity
There are more factors for unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa. According to Gerard López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to the limitations of resources due to legislation passed by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It's not easy for people who illegally seize dollars to earn them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stop migration
López Cervantes said the demographic factor also contributed to the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work, to the United States, has decreased, both because of difficult entry and because even if these people go abroad, it's hard for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising,” he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the global labour market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of employed residents in the state work without paying benefits to the Social Security Administration.
Other features of the labour market, such as low salaries, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are from across the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5 352 pesets by September, well below the national average, which is at 7 375 pesetas.
Shortening of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, between January and June, foreign direct investment amounted to 630 697 dollars, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to 5 143 312 dollars for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government of the State lists investments of 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to service companies.
Debt
In the context of the scenario of a downturn in the economy, the government of that state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. It would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. There were no profits from debt until November, in no sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed out the lack of governing capabilities of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformational Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the government of the state itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really slight during this year. We need to work hard to get back the ground we've lost this year. In 2012 we must redouble our efforts, the harmonisation of the efforts of all of us, and especially the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government, was lacking. Hopefully next year will be much better,” he said.
The slowness of the economy
Loredo López said events like frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and curtailed its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore the dynamism that would enable the movement of processes, products and services to be reached. That’s why we were well below the expected forecasts at the end of the year,” he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employer Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed to more dynamically productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that we are working. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has is mobilized.”
The work that is ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better manage the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, there have been some advances in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that there is a job done here and I think that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us.”
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican Army's forces on 7. June 2010 while erranding in Cipriano Valdez, opposite station 80 in the El Castillo district, Navolato.
The dealer was driving in a white-colored pick up van. He had a black bag in the car in the shelf and a small backpack in the passenger seat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judges of the Second Department and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impacts of Crimes.
Owes contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs like Hábitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger of not being brought to an end or of being delayed due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has gone forward until now, there is now a risk that the government of the state will not be able to secure the appropriate supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million peso for three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Until this time, only the Federation and the city have supplied the resources for the work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of the projects.
"They're supposed to secure almost 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we've got nothing at all. Even though we should have got a part of it in July,” he said. “In order not to waste time, we have started the projects and they continue very well, but we lack money.”
He stated that last year, under the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padillo, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the aforementioned programs this year, we had to raise funds that would cover what the state did not complete," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise by state officials regarding the transfer of these sources, he said a request had been sent to Armand Villarreal, the secretary for administration and finance, to hasten the proceedings and arrive the corresponding percentages as soon as possible.
"They should have given us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not yet received a peso."
The Court approves the "end of analogous broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which wants to hasten the so-called "shutdown of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He said there were no eight votes to invalidate him.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued a decree listing the individual steps that would lead to the transition to Earth-based digital television.
With this result, an action filed by the Senate was dismissed, and this is because a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree thus remaining valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter that is legally reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). This violates the principles of hierarchical subordination and the exception of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported a constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero has accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitalisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister declared that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards measures to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," recalling that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to a federal executive that has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Compensation for analogous digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It considers that delaying change would mean delaying the benefit of digitalisation, which requires decisions on the public interest. Digitalization does not only have a technical dimension, but also “touches on economic, social, political and national security issues.”
As he pointed out, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences entrusted by the Constitution to the hands of the Government of the State."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to a digital system and had done so through their governments, despite having highly specialised technical authorities at their disposal.
He stated that it is not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interferes with the powers of Congress, to introduce compliance with the laws prepared by legislative power in the area of administration.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to data released by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" appeared in this year's election in Michoacán, where in accordance with the data published by the Program of Preliminary Election Results (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and it has not yet been counted by the votes of 879 out of a total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the chairwoman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a number of measures that should harmonise local norms with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due in this parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the stipulated period in the Official State Bulletin Act, saying that he had any objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the voice of the head of state in the matter of constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "or approve or veto" them.
When asked about the possibility of counting "voice by voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council, it would be possible for both partial and total census to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and calculation in the relevant field or it is not available to the chairman; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, the total recount of votes in all ballot boxes may be made if there is an indication indicating that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request by a representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed a candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
The total recount of votes may also be made when, after proper addition, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has finished second. In this case, the electoral packages for which a partial census has been made will be eliminated.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is less than 0.16%, although not yet numbered 129 of the total 923 electoral districts.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. There will be a ceremony and a murching Mass on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honor, along with other people who died in the crash, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard the Mexican Air Force. Family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell to the Technology Institute in Saltillo was organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member during the preparation for graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo, and his wish was to have his ashes scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. That's what he's always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined the flight school Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davila, remembers him as a very good man, "he barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo."
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán at the graduation of his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked best in his life: the control of the plane.
They said goodbye to him last
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, a lieutenant colonel in the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technological High School, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both the studio and the sport.
Bacio Cortés has died in the past few days after a helicopter that was driving fell. The secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other persons, all officials of this state, were also on board.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillen native Bacio Cortés (cremated) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez in a square where, meanwhile, a family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead body found on Cadereyta NL farm
A few hours before the find, military officials presented to the media 11 people detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men murdered by gunfire into various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned farmhouse of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find occurred on a 1.5-kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with the beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the appropriate authorities.
One of the people wore a sports T-shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not wearing a shoe. Next to him was a man also in a sports T-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further, the body of another person was dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton pants.
The three of them were facing the ground.
According to data obtained in the locations, all three people were likely murdered elsewhere because bullets were not found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other and also a series of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereyt
The National Defense Secretary introduced 11 people, including juveniles who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta region and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to published information, at the first attempt on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony, 8 people were detained and managed to free one detained person.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
Another raid occurred on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Caderyta when they noticed a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and discovered one rifle, a casing and 18 rounds.
On the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was arrested around 14 o’clock on 13 November. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terran, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face a crisis that holds the country above the abyss of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face a crisis that holds the country above the abyss of economic disaster and which has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks, which he conducted with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis, because of which the amount of debt has climbed to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package required by European leaders. This is the only way to restore Italy’s crashed credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry. Due to the instability of the markets, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity exceeded the 7 percent threshold, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for a rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: "We have said that we will greatly support this government."
We believe that this government is the last resort for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes of success have multiplied significantly thanks to PDL support from Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant, because until now, a number of its members have opposed the government with a technocratic majority, which is being assembled by Monti.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong support from parliament in order to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in a given effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
Italy's foreign bank association has added to the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could spell disaster.
Monti began negotiations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations.
The round of talks will end Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, who allowed very quick advances in response to the crisis.
After a brief downturn at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates returned to the critical limit, responding to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister would reap success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is at 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the capabilities of the eurozone's current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should hold on to power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians will only give him time to make reforms and then call an early election.
Monti said he would like to incorporate politicians into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be made up of experts only to lead Italy out of the difficulties the country has gotten into because of financial pressure.
Political sources said mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicated the attempt to incorporate political figures into the government as well.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the 50 international match mark.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 players called up has reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica if we compare the 22 players of both countries who met today for a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, the number one month of FIFA’s credit rating, have a wide range of Class A selection matches, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who was the only one to play 50 international matches.
He reached that number last Friday during a match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Stars' Match and in the powerful English Premier League clubs, have maintained intense activity at league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in the European Cups as Champions League for over a year.
To the previous, we must also add experience from the national Spanish team in complicated elimination matches to the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the biggest number of foreign matches from the Spanish team is due to goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (losing 0-1 in London) to former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will still play against Costa Rica today and will get a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, a key player in Barcelona, has 106 matches in his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches in their account. Among them, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the central striker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The hundred was also approached by Carles Puyol with 97 matches.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, left winger Júnior Díaz moves with 48 games and goalie Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Further, only 5 surpassed the 30-match mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest didn't exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one, and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to mark the twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity for them to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate twenty years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day will perform from 19:30 at the National Stadium along with the angelic group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from an interview, the entire transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes a reality.
In South and Central America we are barely the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It's a beautiful country and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally adore the group here, fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you think to your most rocky supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for such a long number of years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already refer to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we've shown in the last 21 years have come out in a few weeks.
We have put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this puts us in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we don't have any limitations on what we can't do.
We will try to show the best possible show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs we're going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it already.
That's how the show is more interesting to us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
With this tour you celebrate 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure.
First of all, I think that none of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realize how much it has given us and we are moved that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are fortunate to be able to look at the places we have always longed for.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the greats themselves are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at once.
We are proud of this and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we went to the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are fortunate that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the group's usual duration.
I think, first of all, we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone with sufficient freedom to experiment with themselves.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
The way we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find balance.
We try not to go too much on tour because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You can't get carried away by being famous, rock stars. Neither of us really cared about that.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and it was something spectacular in the beginning.
We existed as a band for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy being incredible, how I laughed with him. It has always been a joy to work with him, to laugh, to talk about music or football and much more.
She was an incredible person and we miss him so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be tasked with launching a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the front-rooters?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and have to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter?
That's the question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
I'm the first to think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge, even though it's no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt lightly separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out at the same time. And if music is still valid like this today, it's something great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and groups like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly bleak character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there's a couple of tracks in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very bleak, although they may sound positive.
For both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss, which he suffers in the lower limbs area, his attending physician reported.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is already under the control of doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the television station Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why he hurts and why he loses strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his view Fujimori could receive a pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not wish to pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times because of tongue cancer, he lost 18 kilograms, and other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs were added to these problems, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving a sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his rule.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. It aims to achieve trade expansion between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit to full meetings with representatives of the policy, trade and representatives of the Urugua community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information about political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office posted on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be excluded from the international community. The statement drew a negative position from Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has presided over the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries. The Latin American country has an agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation from January this year.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements to get off the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have been signed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has resulted in a strengthening of the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, coming to all stores around the world this month, has been made from the start to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said a press worker specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because up to now successful images like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of pre-existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to being a 3D image, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can embark on the "second round" on the levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome a variety of challenges and "not to succumb to optical illusions".
This new Super Maria entry in 3D also anticipates the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays into the note of those who watch the saga and repeat a successful formula from previous episodes. It consists in the fact that the bearded man's plumber will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the surroundings, in the costumes and also among the enemies, the "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approves extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has stepped up steps on the issue of the release of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder 70 million U.S. dollars.
This is the end of the trial, which aimed to have Guatemala respond to a request from the northern country that calls for the extradition of Portillo to judge him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive powers and that he had in mind that the criminal court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that he had not "interfered" with court rulings during his term and allowed all extraditions that had gone on his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and respect for human rights is guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty in the matter of embezzling 120 million at the Department of Defense at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back to play.
Trinijove helped 6000 youngsters in a state of emergency
The organization was formed to help children without education, so that they do not find themselves on the margins of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the social support organisation Trinijove is very important: 6,000 young people who were in danger of social exclusion have been given help. The organization has been helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
This includes the long 100 jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremony that took place in the former production premises of the Fabra i Coats factory and which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, jobless, drug addiction, or where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association for the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, in the time of the election, showed the unified character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education Advisor, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayor and current environmental-socialist councillor Ricard Goma.
The large Hall of Fabra and Coats also included the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created at a very difficult time and that today's time also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation."
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to combat adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,” he said.
There was an eviction of a seized house where gigantic parties were held
The intruders appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 of the occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by neighbors from number 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied and where they organized gigantic parties that woke neighbors at noon. They left the building by order of the court and without having to intervene the police.
After the end of the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, entry will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupiers, who took up 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partly water equipment, in addition, painted the walls and left all sorts of garbage behind, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties were held, which lasted up to two days and awakened the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales had fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupiers of the building gave her unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while at the disco they cost 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment business had to respond to neighbors' lawsuits over the noise. However, the problems were caused not by visitors to the disco, but by the inhabitants of the seized house and especially by those who participated in the parties held here, whose frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forging her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation over the past few weeks.
The chairman of the PP People's Party at City Hall last week demanded that "the building be evicted immediately and end the problems of civic coexistence suffered by neighbors and the destruction of the area."
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor had been taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civic responsibility that have taken place in the building."
Yesterday, city police also cleared out a building in Nou Barris.
At 15 o'clock 30 minutes, police made their way to building 35 on Mont-ral Street after she was summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the announcement of the proceedings, which entails more than a controversy about royalties
The city's tender for 16 gates again opens the debate over the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest flourishing of the already extinct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper frontier of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that does not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is going in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of the Yogi bear.
Such was the position until September, when the town hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, plays the idea of a park.
Either this or someone is trying to place the gate in the field.
So there's only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a topic as wiped as when two members of this old caste of the chosen ones shake hands during a meeting in the elevator.
And it was this feat that triggered one of the rare matches between what three Barcelona architects and pre-receiving university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayon: the selection process is justified.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf Party began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so the speech of Ildefons Cerd on green apples was not brought to an end.
"We have to base ourselves on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex,” said the architect, for whom the name “gateway to Collserola” carries a “lexicological trap”: we must not imagine them “as entrances to the park, but rather as a demarcation of zones where it is possible to operate”.
The modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the design as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers."
The dangers arising from the "uncertainty posed today by the public place project" after the experience of the 80's, which had "its swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take another step," is basically to take a step further.
“It is necessary to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.”
If we focus in more detail on the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserol can be "considered a park" but the Barcelona part is not, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by Patronat de Collserola, who "must not end up in a junkyard," although he welcomes the fact that City Hall offers his committee to intervene in the project from "the first moment."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of a mountain and a city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in debate, but "doubts" that it should be precisely this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill," he adds) that needs to be created: "Architects should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex because Collserola's global vision is missing in the tender documents: "16 selection procedures have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study to look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least him, to apply for all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may be referring to the concept and definition of the architect of the adjacent gate.
In his view, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the equipment zone, which would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino has pardoned Jonas Larrazabal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal agent, Cadino Red, pardoned the brother of Mayor Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for supposed blackmail.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after Casino Red's legal commissioner pardoned him before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which discussed the case of the blackmail in which Mayor Monterrey's brother was indicted.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás was supposed to ask him to pay for an economic quota to allow the Monterrey town hall to illegally operate in a betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office began a criminal prosecution of the brother of the panist mayor. He was detained on September 2 and jailed for 30 days.
After spending 4 hours before the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was taken to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the state's capital.
He remained at this place for the next 49 days after a second order was handed down to imprisonment and a Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
Day 19. October was taken to the Cadereyta Criminal Court on suspicion of extortion of Casino Red owners by a sum of one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderate surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city's cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
25. An arrest order was given to him in October, issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was gathered to prove Jonás' guilt. Evidence includes, for example, the payment of a $1.5 million peso to casino representatives in exchange for a promise that the operation will be allowed.
This Monday, the legal agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared with Judge Jose Luis Pecin and asked for a clemency for the mayor's brother. On this basis, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the lawful hearing, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damages had been repaired and which of the associates had decided to pardon. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file of 197/2011, the legal pardon of Jonás Larrazábal is granted. In the trial conducted against him, it will not be possible to file any complaint. It is also not possible to claim compensation for damages or punishment.
After hearing the legal agent around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he had been granted an official pardon and his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order on his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash in which the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others were killed.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an accident investigation in which the secretary of the government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others were killed, show that the helicopter hit the terrain directly with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot said the climatic conditions allowed the flights.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings became entangled in the branches of the trees 25 meters from where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore it met all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, he said that based on an investigation carried out in the impact area, no parts were found on the ground.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for transporting people.
The terrain exhibits a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft upward terrain.
“This information supports the hypothesis that it was a normal overflight operation at the time of the accident,” he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome listed six base points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, according to which the aircraft is moving towards the border, between DF and State Mexico were noticeable layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and more visibility all the way to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The crash coordinates and the last recording of the helicopter from the radar agree, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in restricted areas:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
A sketch of the dispersal of the plane's remains suggests that at the time of the impact on the mainland, the helicopter was whole.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene of the crash that indicated that there had been an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the amount of slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show footage that probably broke up along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
After careful search in the vicinity of the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the territory of the demarcation, the remains of the helicopter were not found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still whole.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has launched research into a gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect a gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "The Genetics of Obesity in Children and Young People" will allow you to obtain results related to being overweight.
In a report, the head of the Research Medical Unit in the field of biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team composed of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and students of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, who have or have no authority, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where tests for juveniles will be performed every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He emphasized that the research began at the Cuahtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and from 8. October this activity is also carried out in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are retrieved, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of obesity development, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people to prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are made anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, trigliceride, cholesterol, insulin is determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify the genes involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said this research reflects health workers' concern over the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health polls conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys experienced an increase in obesity of 77% and in girls by 47%. There has also been a dramatic increase in the case of overweight', said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetics, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy, which we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive a general assessment of the condition of the children, thus determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of wrinkles of dark color (acantosis) in the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-candy conditions.
The information is confidential so far, doctors pass it on in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to prevent their children from having the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life meaning a lack of daily physical activity, all-day sitting in front of the TV, and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
Excess weight is also caused by a large calorie intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no potholes in the Asphalt of UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the paving were properly taken care of, there would be no need to repair almost 200 thousand potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, pointed out Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) from UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt cobbles were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the technological cause of the potholes, which he uttered during the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, thus creating a mixture having similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and at high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, for example, in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular mass, which are called asphaltens, and others with low molecular weight, which are called maltenes. Together, they give the asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of the asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, the expert on chemical engineering pointed out.
A scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible paving, consisting of six layers of materials, the last of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the uppermost layers is an asphalt insert, made up of small stones poured in the asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms a liner is wrapped with asphalt.
When cars are passed or when creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the pavement are well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, it would be even better, a chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer called the mantle, made up of fine stones, also covered with sand in the asphalt, is placed on the asphalt insert.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rims, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since it will be subjected to a heavy load as part of the paving, the sheath must have sufficient thickness and be careful of the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is damp, the water spreads inwards and it is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the pavement and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that during the creation of potholes, the film of the cloak is the first to be damaged, and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one time, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first grades using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in the creation of potholes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of tiles must correspond to the load on vehicles and must be guaranteed that this load will not be exceeded. This is the only way to prevent the frequent formation of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to the asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and the research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow you to easily repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multimiss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for finding herself on the podium of the winners, winning a silver crown and a sash, on the basis of which she became the new first multimiss Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and the sceptre took over Miss Atlántico, the mentioned department won the 14th title of the first multimiss. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually declared the first multimiss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), GisAljure (2008).
A question that many ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a big favorite who has shown in all previous rounds that she has the opportunity to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain to become the Queen of Police and the Most Pretty Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who subsequently won the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only First Multimiss is the fact that it did not convince with its answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez from the literary editorial office of Leamos.
When asked, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I believe it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me the most in my childhood was "The Little Prince," a very deep book.
I'm currently reading "Crime and Punishment." It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre."
She did not like this answer both because of the term "culturalization" and secondly because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned to her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy about the result: "The world is wise what is to happen, it will happen.
And you people, read, if you can. The Little Prince is a beautiful book.”
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite's position.
The Bogota journalist suggested that the candidate was the most popular, most celebrated from the beginning and the one that won all the previous awards (the gastronomical challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother) aroused the envy of other contenders, stressing the queen, who then burned on the scene.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit on the Hilton beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she was glowing on both, she was aware that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "As at Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's first multimiss title confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition ultimately doesn't go with the Queen's crown."
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days, and that didn't pay off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of their interest in social work, which are the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just on the margins, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. We need to focus on social sensibilities. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition,” she explained.
There is also speculation that Valle's candidate has lost points because of the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was evident on her butt. But this is completely contrary to the jury's verdict, which chose it to miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the problems with fibrosis on the butt, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took her points only on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the Valle native made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here she took her toll."
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, after the swimsuit show, there was a cruel prediction that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo had given Melina not to eventually award her the highest crown.
Whether it's true or not, it's certain that Melina has started her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite their thrilling success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
Such was the work of the resident of Cali, who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A fingerprint expert from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 last year, a CTI fingerprint expert in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of Supreme Leader Farc: "Alfonse Cano," through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department this week, it was the turn of Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejad, who has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to make his way through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
He moved to the capital, Valle, in 2000, and after taking the appropriate courses, began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of the friction of the skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week that the operation was performed against the said Alfonsi Cana, the Eliazars were told to bring clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he set off for Cauco in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. That's why they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it because of his physical appearance. He looked very different than in the media.
He didn't have a beard, dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, the ink and the transplanter and the light, Eliazar began to compare the dactyl records of the corpse with the card entries.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to Defense Secretary Juan Carlos Pinzón whether he was really the commander-in-chief of Farc.
Searching for clues
For the dactyl scope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of the operational service against "Can" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, these people assist in the research of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present fake IDs or don't have papers at all.
We're gonna take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator recounted that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because at this place the thief was relying to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get a full-hand print and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in a murder case.
Not long ago, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the imprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be confirmed that he was indeed a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that fingerprints are "blurred from objects using chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used for their collection.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registrature.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not entered anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown on the CSI television program.
Like everything that glitters, there is no gold, not everything you touch, traces remain.
However, if it can be used, the relevant comparison must be made.
'Indignation' protests in New York
Hundreds of manifestos crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for orders to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Cast Wall Street movement provoked New York City officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-get the court order to Manhattan Square, where they were taken out in the morning. They then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestos crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that permits the "indignant" to return to camping. The second part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park in the north of the city, where further detention took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, both through gatherings and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray said the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of the camp, ordered by New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, went all the way to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forcible eviction of the site and allowing the manifestors to continue to camp there.
In addition, "indignation" was also seized by another park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the parish at Trinity Church.
For at least an hour, they managed to take up the place, but then the police came and detained some of the manifestos. Bray did not know the exact number, but said he saw that the handcuffs had been put on by some journalists as well.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious leaders also came to express support for them and also to try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which is expected to take place just on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced manifestors even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to the members who guarded the square, which provoked "some small clashes," Bray said, condemning the fact that some of the officers beat the manifestoes.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using "laws that were published after the seizure began, or prohibiting manifestors from accessing the park with shops or other places they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, given the court order, the city has suspended the reopening of public space and warned the manifestors that local laws do not allow them to return with tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the manifestos "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to evacuate because it was becoming "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to hurt others" because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives."
"The morning evacuation was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to sustain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," a spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they plan to organize "big events" for Thursday in collaboration with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which the protests last. They started on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will feature the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other distinguished Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," a lifeguard in "Baywatch," a bunny in "Playboy," the wife of the year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show of Canadian television.
Private broadcaster CTV today announced that Anderson, along with sentimental song singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from online domestic pornographic images, will appear with his ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in the mangers representing Jesus.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently served as a presenter on Charlie Sheena's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear in a special Christmas broadcast of CTV, and is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Returns to Life After Destructive Earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the fall period that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has outgrown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has had to face since World War 2.
The Tokyo government's first estimates have quantified material losses at US$300 000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, is healing well.
After three quarters of crashes, the value of GDP between July and September came in such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive effect: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - moreover, they assume the largest growth rate compared to the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis to strengthen or restore infrastructures. It's about using the shortage to start completely from scratch.
Japan woke up. In particular, due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
Flows have been entrusted in the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "bailouts" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and from worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but it is also a major burden on export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to the June exchange rate in September.
While markets continue to besiege the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen," Motohis Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
Indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing.
It fell four-tenths to 100.4 points, compared with 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average, which is at 100. She got to the level of 99.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With quick and risky marginal guarantees and uncertainty that has reigned again, Greece is increasingly getting involved in the labyrinth, which is leading to exits from Europe's major debt crisis.
The assumption that the "conformity" of the new transitional Greek government is given by the demands of Brussels rather than the genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he was given at his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, declared that he would in no way support the new austerity measures and reiterated his demand for new elections to the expected date of 19. February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of 26. October," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
The package with 24 programmes to support employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not clear doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The Conservative president went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are supposed to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he said he would not support and sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angry with the impact caused by Papandreo's referendum games, stressed yesterday that its demands are inexceedible: it will not block any aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafai, explained that the Inspectors of the Three will return "very soon" to Athens and negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of 8 billion. There is no definitive date.
The Greek spinner has a little something to knit.
Queen Sofia: 'There are tools for progress and hope'
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has "achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the planet's second donor over the past two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is that "it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all of humanity. It is a tool based on trust in man.”
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th Global Summit of Microloans in Valladolid with the belief that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. “In particular, it is about meeting the goals to be achieved by reducing by half the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, that is, with the amount that sets the poverty threshold.”
Spain will "continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women" to whom these loans are primarily intended.
"We have achieved much" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The micro-loan summit is supposed to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support "basic goals."
Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and that 100 million families get above the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries around the world after "the pioneer of the idea Muhammad Yunus went on this journey," the Queen said, adding that this was "an act of justice and necessary recognition."
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who has embarked on a journey of the fight against poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted on the spot with his loan policy.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to establish a constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title of "head of the family" awarded to her in Valladolid yesterday.
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and seeking solutions and thereby allowing the fight against poverty to continue.
"Ethical imperative"
The Secretary of State, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of ballooning, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty."
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty" and now, more than ever before, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microloaning is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates a concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else is closing the door. The mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed participants in the city, which "opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity that is contagious."
The CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the chancellor and chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party, Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, especially to satisfy the members of the party who consider the government's policy today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of standing up at the conclusion of Angela Merkel's speech, and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the chancellor in Europe, "the time for change has come."
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty allowing it to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the eurozone member countries, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "in order to give Europe one face."
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, the inspirator of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK opposes it, and the leaders of the CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will evidently result in the strengthening of Germany's weight.
Led by a concern to calm the climate inside her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not seek to get a congress talking about "small" European states or states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, a bloody battle was taking place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in case of incapacity for work?
After the aid, the UMP party and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will give a speech on the subject of recurring since 2007 on combating social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of sick leave on private sector employees before they start taking support in sickness.
Clearly, without the consent of the business, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, that is, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incompetence compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority also triggers the topic of fraud, which this time focuses on wrongs tied to incapacity for work.
“The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover: if you are caught, you will return,” Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth about iniquities in case of incapacity for work.
These have in fact been the subject of constant surveillance since 2002 and the political onslaught that has been bearing fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance companies), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Care, in 2008 daily refunds, with their 11.3 billion euros, accounted for 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity allowances and accidents at work and 54% concerned incapacity for work, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
Only 2.5% of health costs.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that contains certain deviations: another poll published in r. 2007 on the website of Monster.com's job opportunities showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed replied that they had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time carried out by the institutions of sickness insurance, specifies that in r. 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.
When compared to their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in case of incapacity for work is only a very small part of the black job.
When it comes to fraud, these are only small in scale.
Strengthening legislation from r. 2002 caused systematic checks aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incompetences "unauthorised or too long," i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorised" were counted for 1,2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorised" cases per several million employees who had incapacity for work.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of the June report on the issue, this figure would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said in front of parliament that a hundred days of his unity government would not be enough to accomplish the task.
"To get our economy back on our feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the government chief said, giving his first public speech on Wednesday at the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in parliament.
Implementation of decisions taken by 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of the new government, because our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after being 10.6% in r. 2010 and 15.7% in r. 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday voiced his support for the measures already approved in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committing to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on targets for deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would hinder the economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs and the currency, warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary 8 billion euro loan without a written guarantee from all parties that would support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalised, experts' commission says
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are being denied death.
On the palliative care of the commission, it urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in that sense.
This is one of the conclusions of a comprehensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This commission recommends that the government change criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this choice appears to be necessary for a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
In the beginning, experts quote a recent poll by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medication yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average is valid for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, this number is the highest with 86% of those who died in hospital.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything about the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also subjected control to all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decrimimalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide against non-competent or disagreeing persons.
Conversely, p. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than numerous cases of these rumblings in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are inclined to euthanasia
Recall that, according to an investigation carried out by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe they will allow end-of-life people to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message about the life of the elderly or disabled being less valuable.
With regard to those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
On the matter of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the report's authors say.
They also suggest in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Expert Committee also requires professional doctors to be educated to the obligation to respect the refusal of end-of-life treatment without fear of prosecution.
On the palliative care of the commission, it urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final calming already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the commission requires that it be considered as euthanasia at a time when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Objections from other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of the report's experts-signatories as "extreme" because, among other things, he does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask to help him commit suicide,” said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the report yesterday.
p. Deschamps also underlines that it looks as if the report's authors are putting the autonomy of a person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular about the data on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters manifested in front of the Foreign Office yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resist them and speak of a "complote" against his country have intensified.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the countries neighbouring Syria, took a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
Jordan's King Abdallah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces," he said.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, told the BBC.
On behalf of his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that efforts dedicated to Turkish mediation by the Syrian regime, which had been undertaken since the beginning of the year, were not crowned with success.
“Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough line.
The United States rejoiced at the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the rogue conduct of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" to repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces were killed in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria during this time.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed"in firefights and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, during a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "set out on a way out of the crisis."
After all, he also vividly responded to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus membership, which he said was a "dangerous step."
Syria "will not bow," he added, with the assurance that "complotions spun against Syria will not succeed."
After his decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently deciding a "human protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorably inclined to the idea of sending U.N. observers to help protect civilians from regime repression, which he said behaves "paranoidally."
The League's new special meeting is convening for tomorrow in Rabat to take a stand on a plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on December 2, in which the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by disputes and the liberation of imprisoned manifestos was envisaged in particular.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday considered the decision of the Arab League to be "erroneous" while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and sacrifices from Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will include "victims" in order to regain credibility lost in the past months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of trade unionists and employers today.
It should assemble a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important agenda with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups attending the talks, after a meeting with the proposed prime minister.
House of Commons Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament to express confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti introducing a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the nervousness in financial markets and asked them for time.
In "democracy, the exact deadlines" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its program, he emphasized, adding that it is "sure that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was favorably accepted by the markets at first, but concern resurfaced after an unexpected September slump in eurozone industrial production.
The appointed Prime Minister should assemble a team involving mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept even "politicians" into it.
He expressed his belief that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy a "re-established" strong link.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in r. 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria business union chief Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to reinvigorate the economy "since a country that does not show growth cannot adhere to the deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, the "call to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The great unknown will be the life of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for an atomic weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in atomic risks reported Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency.
Last week, the IAEA communicated its "serious concern" regarding the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, widely drawn from IAEA documents by V. Danilenko (b. 1934) was to work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In r. 1989 or 1991 he was to leave the centre to establish a "nano-diamond" company in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties were meant to bring him to contact in r. 1995 Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he was supposed to cooperate on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear data on the development of the detonation system implemented by Iran" based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked on this technology within the military nuclear program of the country where it came from during a substantial part of his working career.
Anti-Muslim crime and offences rise by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, the number of criminal acts and offences targeting Muslims has risen since r. 2009 to r. 2010 by almost 50%, while at the same time other racial and religious violence fell slightly or rose little.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in r. 2009 to 160 in r. 2010, i.e. 49% increase over the procedure by 13% for violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% in offences against Jews and a total increase of 14% for anti-religious criminal acts and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in r. 2009 it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and offences to rise again,” emphasized Human rights First, an organization dealing with human rights.”
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the organization’s leaders.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these evils,” he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of “hate crimes.”
A "hateful crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This rule of law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
A site providing microblogging services Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of successors, somewhat likening Facebook's services.
New offers "activity" and "name" allow you to better and directly know the activities of other persons who follow you or those whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to track posts, whether they sign up for new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, follow-day pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus and celui des réseaux grand public Facebook
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too similar to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
enrollment of the gold rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of a grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enroll the "golden rule" of budget policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's rating by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of a meeting of ministers in a situation where Austrian public debt, with its 74.6% high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% established by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, the multi-chancellor and foreign minister, Christian Democrat.
Austria thus follows the request of the eurozone summit in Brussels 26. October 2011, where the heads of state and government strongly asked that by the end of r. 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts was written into the Constitution or in the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model," Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the federal state's public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty in 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if only he were to continue strengthening.
"We will intervene, as we did last, if we find too much instability" in the exchange rate of the yen, he explained to Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he only rose again to historical values, which 31. October forced Japanese authorities to intervene.
That day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently broke the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has he regularly risen supported by the purchases of investors, who regard him as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of the world's economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar fell below 77 yen again on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it makes the price of Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of returns earned by Japanese firms from abroad when they convert them into the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, Y. Noda, who fears that this price increase will not kill the yen still in the egg fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% relative to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of growth in exports and household consumption burdened by disaster.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
Japan's finance minister, Jun Azumi, called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its political and monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's supergovernor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Institute raised its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) and raised the ceiling of the sums it devotes to the purchases of various securities to flood with liquidity.
The Eurozone:
rates rise, stock exchanges fail
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stocks still concerned about the stability of the eurozone are falling into negative expectations today on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points at 10 a.m.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
“With new tensions around the proceeds of eurozone loans in trouble, stocks markets around the world continue to make only part of recent gains.”
"Nervous investors are merely too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a decline of 0.7%, which it suffered due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe, and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-launch of uncertainties over the eurozone's future is damaging the currency itself, which continues its downturn on Tuesday.
The euro is reaching its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is worth 1.3570 to the dollar at a retreat of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, the currency backed away after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday, which presupposes the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries that find themselves in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions, affecting the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of Italy's future government, Mario Monti, has strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken by 27. October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate straight line of markets as elections to the House of Commons take place in the country on Sunday.
The rate difference ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of the numbers announcing the growth of the euro area
The statistics say France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. a slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downwards the numbers for the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in truth, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
On its part, during the same period, Germany registered growth of 0.5%.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogma
If there is a subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that occupies the energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed possibilities are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are 7 billion human beings on the planet so far, but demographics will trigger a duplication of electricity demand from now on 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of an important part of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to face a shortage of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse-effecting gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany itself remains in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision of the need to find some other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which considers it right to build only the last generation power plants.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island plant accident.
If the German renewable energy-based model is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants for natural gas and coal.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects in a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European Windmill Champion, of which he consumes 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to irregularity in wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices higher by 65% and respectively. 50% than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an invoice for electricity 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While energy costs are a key factor in the globalised economy and a guarantee of keeping industry in national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful declarations of the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they fundamentally oppose this energy, as opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the construction of a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 downstream jobs.
The strongly exporting sector is pulling a large number of job-creating small and medium-sized and medium-sized enterprises into international markets that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the 6 billion euros a year that the country earns for exporting nuclear facilities and services.
Which plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while the manufacturer's decline would be planned?
When solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, even that there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-CO2 installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industry group AREVA is indicative of the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in blood.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island took place in normal operating conditions and was left without human sacrifice and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the reactor's concepts and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some appear to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lesson of this crash just like it did with the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor is a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all those who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to the offered competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and relaxing the way to seizing a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the overwhelm of the police, the courts and the administration subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights country" that France boasts about.
Recently, it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, which became current, when the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses."
But so far, it has rarely been discussed at the angle of the economy.
It must be said that in this area there is a broad consensus between the left and the right.
On the right, in 1976, Jacques Chirac made the tone with his statement that "90000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million immigrant workers are located" and on the left Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of hordes by Polish plumbers in French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we choose to provide to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that joint development will allow our "migrant problem" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Reducing immigration is crimpling growth and harming employment.
Concerns about the impacts of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are far more complementary than substitutes for French employees by performing work in sectors with staff shortages.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants make the arrival of immigrants a positive effect on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the increase in migration movements of 1% would increase real wages between 0.6 and 0.9% in the long term.
And he does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, one more migrant, aged 30, will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of 150000 euros in its entire life in public budgets.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his desire to achieve the lack of growth percentages with bared teeth.”
The teeth used to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invents democracy, remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, after all, despite the fact that it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the XXth century he experienced the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible.
It is known, however, that it was easy to think.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "tool of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, separation and power control, education, the Enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just like that and since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The confession of the mistake of a Greek referendum of the yes-no type will have the value of double revelation in this respect: the revelation of the necessity of the great return of political power, but also the revelation of a disturbing sense of his impossibility, his inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic struggle have relocated today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot get anything if we require a number of national referendums held according to necessity and disorganisation.
Bianco exposed to the European absolute monarch or jump with his feet tied to the void of the nationalist depth: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we don't want guillotine knives, but we don't want a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous performance of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would no longer know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be urgently restored.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the rule of markets and invest in preparing the future.
The East of the Crisis will be to assume a decision at the European level that will not be accepted without complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us into disaster.
After longing to fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to be "republicans."
The revolution in interest could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be achieved by building a Europe of more political democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let's become Europeans to build Europe.
'Contactless' smart cards spread
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Smart Card Fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 is expected to end with an increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most supportive is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or make purchases just by approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards will be sold worldwide against 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total smart card market (6,925 million cards).
After being in the tow of APEC countries for a long time, Europe gains the terrain in contactless payment.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But the big department stores are working for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard contactless cards this year.
To include a higher gear, banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Two large French companies have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their clients in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only the first stage to a means of payment of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to perform transactions today is equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They've been delayed."
"But their real boom should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sales in the world at 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test conducted in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also Société générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay with a mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is troubled by the unions between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are unions by the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are being confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "sure of it" from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained, without specifying further.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help light up the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by members of AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by special French troops.
In the rubble after the crackdown, French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the calls is conducted to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has been staying long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"This is progress, but we need to no doubt wait for more compelling evidence before we start talking about an operational collaboration between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram, or in its operational practices, which from now on include human sacrifices or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same mode of execution as the devices used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community, led by Washington, has put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little worthy of interest.
Quick success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in r. 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is being politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters are starting a fight against the "centre-inched government."
These people focus first on churches, bars and authorities.
In r. 2009 Boko Haram supporters become extraordinarily active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government's response is, as usual, still the same.
The army will surround the city and the result is 800 dead.
Sect founder Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group becomes radicalized and leaves its location in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he will carry out an assassination in the city of Jos, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the U.N. local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that should lead from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia is now worrying all security specialists.
Now that the Al-Qaida of the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and iger and the Somalis of the Al-Shabaab movement operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said France was on standby and ready to "pass all the information."
The world according to the candidates for president
On issues related to China, Iran or helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by a crisis manage the world through simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and brief guidance on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran or aid to Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination, threatened the Chinese's vocation before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "for the manipulation of their currency," a carrier issue in America inflamed by the migration of entire parts of its industry towards Asia.
The worse, if this must include the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost stumbled at a position that "smooths" emotions.
He demanded a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in last place in election estimates, remains unlistenable.
The Image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt his nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran," he declared fanfaringly.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing his responsibilities to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, as Beijing "tries to develop nuclear capabilities" - evidently ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who backs Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against presumed terrorists banned by Obama in r. 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
They're all far away than he was in r. 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya and thus attribute him to the label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population is assessing President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
He has no confidence from Iraq on military interventions that lead to mids.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking in a more correct place.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream remote pipeline connecting directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has begun to operate.
It must supply gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government, took part in the inauguration of Nord Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together the control round the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will start flowing every year to Western Europe with the first pipeline with a length of 1 224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg with the federal state of Mecklemburg-Pomorany.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of r. 2012 will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the amount that is equal to the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline of the pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly objected to the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow the supply of gas directly to Germany without being routed by a third state (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, the two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to close access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it strongest when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", citing the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in r. 1939.
It means saying it's a politically sensitive subject.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained more certainty of its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created cracks between Europeans from the East and West.
Russia has barely managed to assert its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western states with high gas consumption, whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of this pipeline, demonstrating at what point the big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of the Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of concrete sheath steel to protect it from the anchors of naval vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the period of World War 2.
“Because of the security, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by valves or maintenance stations anywhere in its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project manager rejected it when the Swedes were little eager to see the Russian state company permanently settling off their coast.
"In case of a fault, we stop the gas passage in less than 1 minute," Jens Müller specifies.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered by the builder to be unlikely, after all, the welds were designed to create the leak once every 100 000 years.
The inspection of the condition of the pipeline from the outside is carried out by an undersea robot drawn by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is inserted into the interior of the pipe and is pushed by gas.
At the destination over a full three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about any deformations of metal parts.
The long-range pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all its gas transport capacities for five years with a contract that can be renewed.
"Gazprom will make a profit on the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was ensured by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, investment costs have risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be repaid, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The 4.5-meter high valves form the output gate of the gas.
The sensor measures the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before being transported to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When the full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and in r. 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to re-provide the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The notebook Moleskine is easily recognizable with its black rectangular boards and its leaves of faded white color as if aged over time.
After all, the notebook Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, will decide to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes charge of the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of leather), which is used, for example, for the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine returned to popularity the old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leading person of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is distant from secret production from the first years, when only 3 000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italy's borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook will attract a businessman as well as a student or professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its beginnings, has almost a hundred of them today and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and through the FNAC chain of stores to small boutiques in the center of the cities, where he was able to assert his identity.
“We have followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the tumultuous development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the notebook Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Catch", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also introduced new notebook records reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand extends to a variety of carriers.
Success that drew envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the proportion of unemployed disabled workers so high?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today is opening 15. A week for employing the disabled.
Despite the voluntaristic public policy introduced in r. 2005 the percentage of unemployed disabled persons is still twice the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is that daunting?
"No, underscores Éric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Handicapped."
"The advances made in 15 years are remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed was not two, but three times higher."
"However, there is still much to do."
It must be said that for unemployed disabled people, numerous obstacles remain before their arrival at work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and out of 2.3 million university students, only 10 000 are handicapped.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for handicapped versus 38% on average.
In short, those are the criteria that particularly complicate the return to work and that represent the "core of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much when it comes to objective brakes.
There remains unspoken, ways of thinking that are surely evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that interviewed managers have a" weak level of knowledge about disabled people" with" an exaggerated idea of people in a mobile chair and mental or mental deficiencies."
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employing 6% of the disabled workers provided for in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers that come from r. 2008, indicates a state equal to 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for levying fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
The proof is the number of "fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 of the offender to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The Law of R. 2005, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers versus 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before they challenge the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens on Tuesday night (20h45) on Tuesday night, they did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the grandstand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach was only giving words of praise to his player.
“I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
When it comes to the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it's one and the same, it justifies itself.'
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean my mark."
Gambling, spared against Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France, is coming to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
The concept of "joy" cannot be forgotten.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he argues.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more because opposite "they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he reminds.
"We crisscrossed immediately."
"To play against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Goodheartly, Leekens also recalled "pride."
"Pride" to fight "match - holiday".
"Pride" also to state in the quality of the "neighbors" that France became a very high-level team a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous amount of work," he sighed.
Although Belgium will be absent from the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he said.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're healthy hungry."
"You'll realize that for the next games." Including that against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is starting with great optimism the barrage against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of those 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, whose helm has been in position since 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing Friday's result (0-0) in hell in Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of superiority, but it was not able to score such a rare goal that would relieve it.
"It's a good result, which nonetheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal outside."
But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident that they will advance in front of the audience, which should create a soring cauldron there, even though the match definitely appears to be "very balanced," says the optimist, but sharply reasoning Bento.
“We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite confident that we can have the upper hand,” the Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," the successor to Carlos Queiroz relativized.
An indecisive Friday's match in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for Bosnians who also need to score a goal.
“It’s a good result, which nonetheless contains a risk because we didn’t score a goal outside,” Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities.”
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have an interest in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that they don't give them time to think."
A good idea, on the condition that this time it turns out to be realistic.
