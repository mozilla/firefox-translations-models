During an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend
During a call to an emergency line, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he had shot his girlfriend and it was necessary for them to come home.
Lamb argued that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset by the house, and that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.
Inside the police, they found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-language message on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could give it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," read the letter, which Lamb had signed, according to authorities.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the campus, where police believe he shot the popular professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Police chief at Delta State University, Lynn Buford, said university staff heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb is said to have made a fateful phone call to the emergency line shortly after.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, it forced students and the faculty to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details, which were published by investigators on the part of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were in the lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote in a thank you to the "greet people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, along with 17th other faculty members, and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there have been inclinations in terms of problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shimmered, "as if something wasn't right with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb has previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, when it said it had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to recruiting university staff meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard wouldn't guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
The president of the university, William LaForge, said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mrs. Lamb seemed to have been bothered by anything."
Lamb will not answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the Arkansas border back to Misissipi.
Before he could have been arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single shot from a gun in the yard of a house about a mile from his parents on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington, Washington, confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this country.
Lamb began working at a university that has 3500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and hours of education.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a clever, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older guy who taught her guitar for years.
It was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
The hearts of all the girls have softened as soon as he showed up," according to Hairstone, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During an emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the shoulder of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was a best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
They later played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartman and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sparmly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, the sweat that Lamb finished on guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"He was just a happy couple," he said.
We were dabling and recording each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the slam professor, led the seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a student student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students and community members, attended a commemoration with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also took part in a vigil during which the college sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is behind us.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis have filed a message in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to the report.
The story was modified to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to an emergency line after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Seasonal Workers
Toys R Us declares that they will not gain as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturers of children's toys and products say it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40 000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, a decline from 45 000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company declares that it will start recruiting candidates this month and will recruit employees in October until December.
While the holidays on their own are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help in business and sell, for sending and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about its 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge professional moment for Michael J. - Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to come when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Grow in Time."
The movie begins and I realize that I am within reach of something that could be called a fake date with a princess from Wales.
"Flow in time," is a documentary about "Returning to the Future," which puts on interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of "Back for the Future" was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "It's really unquestionably the best travel documentary for me that's ever been filmed."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution to the conflict" of a nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the side of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting at the end of this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "would have made this situation insoluble."
Ban called on five permanent members to show solidarity and unity they showed when Iran's nuclear deal was reached in a resolution in Syria.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in a real light
Some have tried to label him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands at a failed joke.
Some are preparing for the implosion.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are not doing well (yet).
10 of the latest 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is in charge of a double-digit number, and some people are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the nomination chances of this real estate tycoon.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this is saying that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership made the way to the rise of Herman Cain, in the end neither of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into general elections.
But outside groups like the Super PAC of Yeb Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump’s will to endure and are starting to lay their dollars at the point in order to overthrow it.
Here are some recent vote numbers that suggest that a real estate magnate is not just a fleeting phase:
Trump's rating of favorability turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University voted that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three of the 10 say they have a negative view of him.
And these numbers hold up in the early stages.
After a vote by Quinnipiac University last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voter would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC poll, which took place last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "superior" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they were "indignant" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson is creating roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "intrent" to 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next one closest to the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "disputed" or "disturbed" if the business's favorite, Jeb Bush, became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompousness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters are nationally inclined to the idea that a real estate mogul has the right temperament for the post of president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post vote.
The same number sticks to the senatorial club of state Iowa, which is the first in the entire country, where 52 percent of Republicans think they have a commander's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think they don't have a personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their christening hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
Asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best option, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a late July change, when four out of 10 were betting their money on Jeba Bush.
Total publication: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the previous cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Still, it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another nominee, Trump is still beating almost everyone.
Some scholars stress that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump is leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusion disseminated among more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University survey at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always get majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally by Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points for each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader with a wide 19-point in a one-on-one hypothetical match.
The bare majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have already made up their minds.
Tuesday's CBS/NYT poll shows that just over half of Trump-supported voters say they won't change their minds.
Obviously, that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their minds.
46 percent say they keep their back door open for change among candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest adversary is his outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would go twice more likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign's report, immigration still holds as the main and central theme of the conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's pompousness will distract key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and the damage to rebranding.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the subject of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain, too.
Frustration from the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are getting about half of the support from Republican voters today, mainly given their state of outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post vote on Monday claim they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
They are also very angry with Washington.
A few weeks ago, Des Moines Register/Bloomberg vote in Iowa revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "Helf-ored."
The House supported a larger share of the state from coal charges.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the revenue of the fees from the surface mining of brown coal from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that thanks to this, they would get money extra money for both the state treasury and municipal budgets.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The Chamber of Deputies in the first reading supported the government amendment to the Mining Act, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the proceeds of the fees from the surface mining of brown coal from the mining company.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will be reduced from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating the reimbursement for minerals that companies will benefit from.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
Last year, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
From brown coal mining, municipalities were about 200 million crowns and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in payment from mining areas with permitted mining to 1000 crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these reimbursements should continue to belong to municipalities in full.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities will receive between 14 million and CZK 100 million per year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but it is determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be re-assessed as the product of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by a government decree need not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges a mineral that is state property.
Fees are paid only by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter will be given to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be purposely bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining emergency services.
The draft was criticized by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that they would harm the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
The increase in unemployment in the Most region was warned by Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
According to mining companies, the increase in fees will not translate into coal prices because prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government’s decision on coal mining limits before the law was passed.
If coal is mined even beyond the limits, then it will have effects on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should fall after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as the number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board during Thursday's Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them will probably interfere with the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the load on the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
There is heat in Delhi and high humidity, so challenging matches are expected, which can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it according to the weather.
And according to what it will look like, Navrátil said during today's training of the Czech selection in the center of Raj Kumára Khanny.
He is counting on the number one team and the world forty Jiří Veselý for Friday and Sunday's singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Stepanek are likely to make their role as number two.
I want almost everyone to get involved.
I've had it in my head slowly, but I won't tell, the captain said.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Stepanek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who will face up alongside an experienced doubles player who has a record 18:4 in the Davis Cup in doubles.
It probably won't be fun.
There are options left with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know who and what it will look like," Navratil said.
It will be based on the development of the doubles.
The option may be Pavlásek, with Veselý surprised in Round 1 by winning the doubles over the Australians.
"It's decent for the doubles," Navratil said.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I would like to show the same performance I showed there from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to bring a point," Pavlásek said.
The home side will put in the doubles of Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP) rankings, which was won last week by the challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the players of the third and fourth hundred rankings.
The second will be Somdev Devvarman (164.).
Both are challengers and ours have experience from the ATP Tour, but many times we have convinced ourselves that the Davis Cup rankings do not decide.
"The current form decides, the weather," Navratil said.
Friday's opening singles will start at 6:30 CEST and can stretch due to the weather.
According to the forecast, it has rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played in artificial lighting.
They've already sparked it, and it's got some two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," Navratil said.
Jeremy Corbyn to debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut in PMQ is very enthusiastically expected
The new work manager Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will work with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he asked for "less theaters and more facts."
He also said he could skip several sessions to leave for his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corby's leadership, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech on Tuesday to the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand quietly during the singing of the national anthem on duty on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has come up with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and is at the center of attention of several stories on the front pages of newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in a respectful silence" and that he would recognize "the heir to the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, cited differences in the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "compromised" after Mr Corbyn's appointment through his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers' Party had submitted alterated proposals to eliminate the full idea of the dose limit.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow work and pensions, said the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers' Party, to whom David Cameron has faced in decades since his election as the leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the Workers' Party, who promised a different approach to politics, argues that he has ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
MP Islington North argues that PMQs are too confrontational and that it will linger both "ready responses," and toothed trade, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadowy trade secretary, will represent him on PMQ when he doesn't attend — like when Cameron travels abroad.
He also refrained from the idea of letting other colleagues come to speak for him from time to time, because he said he had yet to discuss the matter with House Speaker John Bercowe.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the style of "Punch and Judy" policy, which was often linked to PMQ but a few years later admitted that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of the leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their stance among the other MPs, even though the critics have argued that they had become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photocute in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
But one group of former street kids has found a way to learn something and earn a living.
"I've been photographed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and earn money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises while UK salaries accelerate
The pound jumped on the following data and showed the recovery of UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was brought up using the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, GB gains, including bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest rate since 2009 and it seemed like the estimates of when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% at the top against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% as of 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock market and jumped 20% after getting an approach from his rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bringing brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch closer.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival group of Richemont luxury goods.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
Shares at Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose by $2.5bn using shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest slump on the index and fell by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded his rating on the firm to "sale."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after a sports firm announced an 83% jump in mid-year profits £46.6m
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expanse
The executive chairman of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that purchasing power would outrage higher wage costs in his firm, he states.
Costs could be hit by plans to expand to JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building maršmelon are cheering.
The controversial building got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the construction, which is to be built in close proximity to the Agnes Monastery in the center of Prague 1, and a petition was also created.
The municipality stated in the decision that there was a violation of the Building Act because not all the requisites of the zoning decision were respected.
"The zoning decision in question does not contain some elements, for example, the type of land, the distances from neighboring buildings, sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described the shape of the building, the delimitation of the territory affected by the influence of the building," his decision reads.
It also considers the illegal magistrate that some of the documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which has changed.
For example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file material that, however, the owner of the land thus only documented the consent to the project documentation for the zoning proceedings, not consent to the location of the building on his land, writes the Department of the Building Code.
According to Francesco August Razett of the investor firm, the Department of Building Code did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the commencement of the review has already expired.
This is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people nickname marshmelon because of the allegedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city centre in the past to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are bothered that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that should have looked different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate neighborhood of the Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which envisaged a glass facade, was rejected on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) by the Ministry of Culture and abolished the permission of Prague conservationists in 2010.
The new project of Praga Progetti e Investiments with windows in the shape of faces but the NPÚ and the municipal conservationists approved and on this basis a building permit was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the reproaches of the opponents, he said he never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname of pink-and-white confectionery.
The Czech politician drove migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary with the aim of bringing humanitarian aid to refugees.
On the way, he and the crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, who were said to have wanted to carry about half a kilometer.
At the time, he said, it was not yet criminal in Hungary, he told Lidové noviny.
We knew that law enforcement officers would not have affected such behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transported us to pre-trial detention in Szeged, he described the paper.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
Police officers were said to have behaved correctly, but communication was stalled because they did not speak very well English.
The jail was sad.
For example, in our cell of about three by four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were crowded.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there the next day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them next, Berg said.
What can't be confisive?

You can ask her about the changes to the law on executions valid from 1 September 2015 to other things related to executions or executors.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaw of Aldi in southern and western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in southern and western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food vendors and build the IGA brand using mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide shows.
IGA merchants and suppliers are joining brands like Dunsborough-based Simmo's ice cream maker offering tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when a food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrates its annual investor strategic day.
There is a lot at stake because South and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of the IGA’s trading steps and generates higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notorious and IGA trades enjoy much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in the WA compared to around 14 percent in eastern states.
In any case, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will slap 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that have taken over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that retailer IGA could lose $360 million on annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in southern Australia and 30 in the Western Republic over the next year, and will generate sales of $500 and $600 million in individual markets.
Loss of food sales and volumes in the Metcash solid price base could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly against Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan poll found that shoppers in the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Methash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the senior fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan financial group, said business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comment.
But it is known that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share fell from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and the earnings from the Meccas food store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have plummeted 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational development of the downstream change as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesale has gone into counterattack and invests more than $150 million a year to match the counterpoint prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA retailers re-equip the stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
Chief Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that price and retrofitting programs will catch the moment and hopes the wholesale sale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healym
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame for his behavior rather than criticism.
Than asi Kokkinakis has become a side loss at a recent fuss about his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called "Special Ks," he pulled on himself with unwelcome attention thanks to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declared: "Wawrinka should have been stretched to Kyrgios and I should have reached out to him too."
While he was last seen smashing the rocket after a cramp thwarted a possible outreach for Richard Gasquet at the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis unwaveringly defended Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he competes with Sam Groth for placing in the second singles behind Bernardo Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I was thinking very intensely that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little bit involved in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed his racket when he lost because of a cramp in the US, but he is not the first player to take out his anger on his racket because of his frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But he was seriously very well controlled because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated somewhat hard.
He is a very adult 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits well into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with other players, in the dressing room he is very respected, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I simply think that he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important match that begins on Friday, stating that "mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term star.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not on all the controversies that have arisen around him [Kyrgios]," says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, growing rapidly in the eyes of the public, he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we are trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight when he will be able to think about it is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the announcement of the state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed its southern border with Serbia and detained those who attempted to cross it illegally to stop the infarge of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants piled up in the country of no one and Serbian authorities reacted in ardent manner.
Those who have been stranded for an unknown time on the country's belts between two states stand those fleeing violence in their native lands build tents and settle in.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter over them, the migrants together call "Open the Borders!" and they scollock the riot police.
Some in protest reject food and water.
Serbian Foreign Minister says it was "unacceptable" that refugees should be sent back from Hungary, while more and more of them arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of a solution, not just an indirect injury.
Over the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-state bloc did not come up with a unified immigration policy at the ongoing meetings in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40 000 people seeking protection in a surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement for another month or at the end of the year, which would be accepted by the EU's peoples of more than 120 000 other refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU summit in the next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis on Tuesday.
Hungary, however, did not strain its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to solve the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up court cases of asylum hearing.
Meanwhile, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when a fence is now finished on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the inmates were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main weakness and entry point into the European Union for Refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who go beyond a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that clearly differs from other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary are now criminalizing violations of the 4-metre fence that the government had built on the southern border with Serbia, and also sets longer prison terms for those who are illegally transferring refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
In this we are quite clear: illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the army that was expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters on the border have been observing heavily armed forces with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's adviser to domestic defense, said the authorities had caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 have already caught the territory of the state.
They have penetrated through damage to the fence and are now charged in police custody for committing offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence fixed.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered with barbed wire.
At the main border crossing near Roszke, chaos arose, because the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people was created.
About 20 of them could fit in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary when they refused food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still holding a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up on her lead.
Clinton now backs 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (a 17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to announce whether he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly the decision to support the candidate.
But Clinton sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton lost ground for several demographic groups, while Sanders gained several.
Clinton maintains a big lead among women and eases, but her leadership narrows.
Her support among men has declined significantly, and Sanders loses only 5 points to her.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and now she and Sanders are equal.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to the older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders loses only 5 points in the group.
About half of the Democratic primary electorate across the states says they would enthusiastically support Clinton if they become a party candidate.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because they are a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It's probably no surprise that Clinton's current adherents are particularly inflamed because of her.
The views are mixed between those who don't support Clinton at the moment - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question of why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), it follows that it is time for them to be president a woman (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, a great possibility of election and consensus on problems is quoted.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidency for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like that foreheads - a third think they shouldn't run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second election for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half of Biden cited Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats' nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the nominee with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as most likely electable increases.
However, when there was a question of greater importance to the candidate, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over a greater chance of being elected.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate appears as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and they think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden of the three leads in sincerity, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 per cent don't think about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological perspective.
As for all these standards, about a quarter of the Democratic electorate has no opinion on Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, most of the primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that their overall view of her did not affect her at all.
But it's a different story among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public views on this topic were already divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans say this email controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent their views on Clinton deteriorated.
It is mainly about Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their views on Clinton deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy among her party's constituents, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honest and credible, a decline of eight points last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think they're honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush performed best in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, like Carson, a lot of voters didn't make up for him.
The margin of error in the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson ends up behind Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson gets closer to Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half the electorate in the latest poll, and the others are getting support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, and climbed from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and knocking out Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carla Fiorin and Ohio Governor John Kasicech, is behind the Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker completely on the gallery from 10% support to the current 2%.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of errors in a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week, showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans for Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is far ahead of Carson.
With the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot blindly on a retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said during the Iowa campaign last Saturday.
Five members of the fraternity accused of death of first-year-year-year-old Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died during the overloading fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, charges were filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Dengo during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and belated took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police announced.
Police say his eyes were tied, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination across the frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of Pi Delta Psi did not call the fraternity 911 immediately after Deng passed out and allegedly waited an hour before being taken to hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the nationwide president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide the equipment and essentially preferred the well-being of brotherhood over the life of Michael Dengo," Chief Wagner said.
He failed to revive him and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a blugent object in the head, torso and thighs.
"So many families have been devastated as a result of overloading in fraternities and at least one student dies every year for overloading since 1970," writes Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Fraternity and their members must be accountable, and this step is important from the institutions.
A grand jury of Monroe County has recommended third-degree murder charges for the top five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Mengo, will also be charged with assault by overbursions and a criminal association.
"We would like to detain not only the persons involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College has banned fraternity and national fraternity has lifted its relationship with local branches.
This is where the Fed raises interest rates
The rise in rates will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how much time it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came after 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve in rate hikes is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why officials of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hike will begin, but rather the trajectory, how long normalization will take.
There are actually more variables in the game.
However, eventually market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the increase in speed may be exaggerated.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the ‘cheap money era,’” Julian Jessop, head of the Capital Economics Global Economist, said in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to a more common but still low will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that adverse effects occur.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in about a month, the expected rate hike can make air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There is a trend to stop stocks again after 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market in about 35 years often the most - about 14 percent - goes into a rate-to-flake rate hike in relatively flat in 250 days (average increment of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yield from the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dollo, the main equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and return is beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but raising rates often help it.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that have not yet existed and that could have a hasten recession.
What is most remarkable is that gross domestic product close to its lowest point in history with a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal increase in GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Despite the fact that in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 percent, few expected to keep it, when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this complex economic background could be risky and the question could raise up, "whoever this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for the Fed's growth for a year and all eyes turned to meet by the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that FOMCs could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading will only indicate a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increasing cycles have so far been in a super cycle of leveraged effect increasing with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the incipient recovery," the report reads.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest of those with the Fed waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still continuing.
The fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what the stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more quickly evident in bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes the direction of politics.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/reduction cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Strategists Charles Schwab believe that a rate hike will cause yields to approximate yields between long- and short-dated bonds, which will equalize the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still careful about the strain on the yield," Kathy Jones, a firmly analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, the credit range has widened, and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens the policy.
Generally speaking, companies that carry out most of their U.S. business win interest rates after rising, and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will do worse, as the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the space of the world market, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of stocks tends to overcome within three months after the initial rate hike," analysts Goldman Sachsve said in a message to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets overcame weak balance sheet companies in every interest rate hike in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-willing companies, as well as low volatility stocks, have also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to the purely equity games, consumers also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized this station for "typing"
He is of the opinion that he is becoming increasingly indiscriminate from his commercial opponent
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're just cheating on Brits
Colleague Damien Collins attacks Voice and says he is not an original idea
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" in Classic FM, a leading MP says, accumulating fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove they're doing something they don't do commercial broadcasts.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC executives that the public service radio station appears to be "stupid" and becoming increasingly indiscriminate from its trading rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "focused"- but it seems to be changing to the Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you're actually just mimicking what we already have in the market," Bingham said.
The director-general of the BBC has denied the allegations, stating that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3, I would not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live music and the creation of music is actually at the top level.
"I also think that Radia 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, the BBC regulator, Radio 3, argued Alan Davey, by saying that it is now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before, because Britons are less educated in terms of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's production to come under fire due to pedaling on the heels of business competitors during the broadcast of Culture, Media and Sport and got to the Commission's hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as a non-original and not particularly different one?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which stars Paloma Faith andBoy George shine as judges - was made "a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" when it starts the fun series next time.
However, he refused to rule out ordering multiple future series of The Voice shows or spending money from royalty payers on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth was recorded since the records themselves began in 2000
Internet sales were boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November Black Friday could be the reason for the brakes on spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and thanks to it, many British main streets have become ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of steadying online sales, and new figures show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August was the lowest increase in growth since the very beginnings of measurements of the year 2000, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of stabilization of online sales, and new figures show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," Andy Mulcahy, an IMRG index editor, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago, when customers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is stagnant somewhat, which is why it seems to be fading away.
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe customers could delay shopping ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average of shoppers turned to their computers to arrange purchases and drop several retailers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers are again contracted, can detain customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims bury victims of crane crash in Mecca and Bin Laden family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried away by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of the Saudi Binladin Group design magnate.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane crash at the Grand Mosquilita in Mecca. The bodies of the victims were carried down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, mourners chose the path and paid their respects to the victims when the first of the fallen made it onto his last journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaisse.
The sad message passed by the holy place where, just a few days earlier, the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and dropped on the faithful.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctified the bin Laden family's construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
Bodles 29 dead after crane crash at Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried by streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual pilgrimage of the haj.
Saudi officials have already promised that the haj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman said today that Binadin Group should not have left the shoulder of the crane upstairs when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by a state-run Saudi news agency, reports that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disk agency did not report this detail, but said the company's bosses were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are corvling before the pilgrimage of Haj later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statement about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not made available for comment.
Royal decrees have also accused the group of not using the latest safety measures, and the lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and running large construction projects.
Late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident happened amid strong winds and rain just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom on a pilgrimage, which every proficient Muslim must complete at least once in their lives.
Officials say 158 people are still in hospital.
Officials determined that one million riyals (£174,000) would be donated to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half this amount.
B&Q chief claims Eastern European traders working for cheaps already trend
Britons increasingly employ artisans, Veronique Lauray says
The number of educated traders from Eastern Europe is beyond growth point
The result is an open 200 Screwfix store focused on traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country

The British are said to put down their hammers and brushes and hand them over to employed educated Eastern European craftsmen to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to do the DIY jobs at their home, according to the company's boss for Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new executive director of Kingfisher, who owns the domestic needs chain, argues that a large increase in the number of trained retailers from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other screwfix stores focused on traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laura says she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store make better halves.
Most of the workers are currently male.
She said there was a need to reach out to the growing demographic trends that show more female households that make more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laura says: "Much is still working in our shops mostly.
We need to get closer to the balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of decisions about buying goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading companies under the UK FTSE100 index, also restructured her top team to reflect the equivalence between men's directors and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having a half-representation of women among employees, including the Executive and CFO.
Ms. Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to come to us.
Kingfisher announced a drop in both mid-year profit and sales after the group took the cost of closing deals.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in jeopardy.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-chairman of TOP 09, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS chair Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long term it would be better to be in standard valorization, because it would be reflected in the next years.
"We have room to find the mechanism we're going to do," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was supposed to be valorized next year beyond the law.
Marksová defended the subsidy by arguing that she would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said is not rosy.
According to her, higher valorization next year would mean a budgetary impact of 5.5 billion crowns and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of valorization had been reduced.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
The veto right will significantly complicate the payout in December and perhaps even make it impossible, he said.
The chairman of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore, proposed a shortening of the deadline for discussing the standard in the committee to ten or 20 days, even the right blocked this.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the state a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to go mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Earlier this year, pensions are expected to rise by about a hundred crowns on average.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
Even those who lost their pension in December before paying could also get it.
However, they would have to apply for a surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are regularly valorized by the increase in prices and a third of the growth of real wages.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the state’s closing account, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenses.
According to data in the state closing account, the average full old-age pension increased by 104 to 10,714 crowns last year.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided a payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the Senate seat was almost certain for the billionaire.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the Western Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his post in Sunday's elections.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but they are chosen by the governor of the three candidates whose names he announces before the governor's elections.
After the election, he will choose the senator himself from the trio of candidates.
A complication for Jakun's was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin, it is an extraordinary and empowered ambassador to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The filming of the Czech comedy The Tiger Theory has ended.
The last straw in the resolution of the main hero is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to John that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar path.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom.
He longs to reclaim the reign of his life - and as a solution he will choose to escape from the previous one, Slavík said.
Bajgar wanted to capture a certain type of relationship in which one partner does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would fall to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Nevertheless, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a prolonged break associated with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised him.
We had a deal with each other three years ago.
I had him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he was probably a cocoal athlete.
Before filming the next scene, he always asked where he would sit.
This time he rode a bike, climbed the rocks and even walked uphill.
And all this in record tropical heat, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women are marrying a tiger to make him a rabbit over time.
They pour him some food, but they immediately close the door so that he doesn't happen to play outside the rabbit house on a tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have slightly negative effects on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
It's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and means well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Baigar said.
The film also describes the fates of Jan’s married daughters Olinky and Alice – Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová – and the Zetsůšt's Erik and Pepík’s – Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film was produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The US internet company Google has promised to provide an additional $5.5 million to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
This was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, a charity offshoot of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled Telička's part of the visit for criticism of human rights violations.
Czech MEP Pavel Telička, a member of the European Parliament for the ANO movement, postponed the upcoming trip to Baku on Thursday, because the Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku is justified by last week’s EP resolution, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička was co-author.
By the decision of the Azerbaijani side, Telička lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as also a visit to political prisoners, which depends on the approval of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press statement.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the leadership of parliament and representatives of the executive branch as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to the Czech News Agency.
The EP resolution condemns "unpreceding repression against civil society in Azerbaijan."
It has called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after a recent ruling over Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadijama Ismail, who advocated the detection of corruption in government circles.
Russia has not ruled out building its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky, during a visit to Novosibirsk, did not rule out that the Russian air base in Syria would be established in the future.
We don't have that kind of plans yet.
Nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia already has an ancient naval base in the port of Tartus in Syria, which it has used so far more as a service and logistics center.
According to Russian press reports, however, since the beginning of August, the supply of Russian armaments and military equipment to Syria has rised.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Latakia, which for the time being remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia’s specific military intentions in Syria, US commentators agree.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov, it was their third telephone conversation in the last ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow next week to convey concern about the gathering of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Moscow's losing bet.
He said of Russia’s policy objectives in Syria that they are rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria a satellite.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin pursues a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is supposed to be the main topic of Putin’s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to Russian news speculation.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbas region.
According to today's report by The New York Times, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a meeting of the United Nations.
Opinions among White House advisers are still being diverging.
TASS news agency today, citing the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, wrote that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York stay.
Sesame oil on the gallbladder diet, hemp helps to strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is the use of extra virgin oils.
When pressing from cold seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common reason for the death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss the pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of gallstones.
These are 90% of the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these problems three times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder concern especially overweight people who do not play sports and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used even in a liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder one.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that the consumption of this oil brings, they should beware of goods from exotic grocery stores.
Manufacturers from Asia often use pre-roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all the active substances, described Ladislav Hačecký, executive director from the Czech company Bohemia Olej z Kraslice in the Sokolov region, which produces cold-pressed organic virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses only unroasted seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can press 8 kilos of sesame.
Mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutritional substances would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits from heart and blood vessel diseases.
The Czech favorite among the oils is sunflower.
The research of Jarmila Hamerská, which she led at Masaryk University, showed that it was preferred by 43% of respondents in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it begins to overburn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, for flavoring salads and is especially suitable in the diet, in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which most of all fatty acids lower cholesterol.
For heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of total received fat and calories.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower one lasts as much as the sesame and hemp 9 months.
Storage in the fridge will extend the shelf life.
Old oil is especially known to the bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no cataract at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Seeds of technical hemp belong to the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids are not able to be produced by the body on its own, and one must take them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition has shown that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is advisable to include in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and in the healing of injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about using hemp oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling in Bohemia Olej.
It is sold 500 liters a year.
People often take one spous of an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not very distinctive, but it will strengthen immunity perfectly, advised Daniel Vlček from the Kraslice company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of grillers are Americans.
There is 1.4 grills per household.
All over the world, various barbecue competitions are held, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have not grilled in their lives.
The vast majority of them grill several times a year.
In order for grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marinating a few hours before the heat treatment.
Which oil is best for this and at the same time it retains health-promoting substances when grilling?
In general, with the grilling process itself, it should be saved from fat.
Experts agree that a large part of the oils begins to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils then also lose the body beneficial substances, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from dishes treated at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils do not find their application when grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from Bohemia Oil from Kraslice in the Sokolov region immediately think of grape oil.
It complements the taste of meat and fish.
In the kitchen, it is characterized by a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, because it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, it retains health-promoting substances as one of the few oils, describes the benefits of grape oil Daniel Vlček from Bohemia Oil, which is one of the few Czech producers of this vine oil.
Experts agree that grapeseed oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high amounts of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in fighting excess cholesterol.
In grapeseed oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the beneficial content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grapeseed oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves skin elasticity, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grapeseed oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when seasoning salads, but also for heat treatment of dishes.
Therefore, it is possible to use two ways when grilling, when marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we will preserve their juiciness.
When preparing the marinade, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we supply acidity with apple cider vinegar and achieve softening of meat.
The spicing adds flavor to the meat and the oil preserves and adds the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grapeseed oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that it can penetrate through dark meat.
Marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, what to do next?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare meals.
The same goes for grilling.
Some oils are a complete taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, rub the grate with oil, preventing the meal from burning.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of side dishes.
Virtually anything is suitable for grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many others.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, the hot summer salad.
To it you need: • 1 pec of peaches • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup of chopped cucumber • 1 cup of a mixture of salad leaves • 3 tablespoons of grapeseed oil
Add the topped arugula, chopped cucumbers and large cubes sliced peach to the salad bowl.
To the taste of salt and pepper, you can also season with minced chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle with a few drops of grapeseed oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can then sprinklt the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not only about the medication, but also the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerososis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients also includes social counseling, recommendations for housing adjustment, etc.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and he does not have to fundamentally change the style of his life.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick relieves space for the activity of the disease.
For example, it is proven that regular exercise greatly delays the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, for example, a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not succumb to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That is why the site is created Give a Ching (www.bezmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Give a chance.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the adage is twice that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more likely the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerososis at an inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay the disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
It is very important in people with multiple sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often solves the weakening of the lower limbs or disorder of balance.
Patients are treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve gait, strengthen the pelvic floor, relieve swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It's really individual, it depends on the patient's specific problems," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Education, Motol University Hospital.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation can not stop the disease, but it can always relieve its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the body, which is desirable in case of multiple shrimp.
Another positive of regular exercise is the fact that the sick verify what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
"During the exercise, endorphins are also washed out and a person feels good after him," the PhDr. Kamila Algae from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of the University Hospital Královské Vinohrady.
By influening the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This directly interferes with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Premese old, these patients were so-called saving, today we know that they need a targeted burden," prof says. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Education, Motol University Hospital.
The goal of physiotherapy is to keep a person as long as possible self-sufficient, including job classification.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with occupational therapists to get a compensatory aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or a psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most of the time it shakes people.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
They have to respond to a great deal of health - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we are supposed to go to someone, not to try to bear everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them in such a way that in the end they come to the conclusion that even with handicaps a full life can be lived and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Aircraft production is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can not immediately produce and process.
Nevertheless, in addition to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for shaping composites, it can come across something as ordinary as apricot stones.
In a drum that resembles a pot for cotton cans, the edges of sheet metal parts that have just left the milling machine are remedy in a pile of stones.
"So far, no one has figured anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of Air Door Manufacturer Latecoe Czech Republic.
In the area in Letňany, the former Letov produces a complete door for Airbus A320.
As the only one in the world, they add a door for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is being assembled in Prague, passengers also enter the first and higher class on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner Airbus A380.
There are also doors full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accurateness is the main motto.
For example, the company has torque keys adjusted twice a year.
If there was a recording of the inspection on the yellow sticker, they would have something to explain to the auditors of the Airbus or Boeing in the Prague plant, who regularly go to find out if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
But the human senses have not yet been completely replaced by advanced technology.
On one door to the A320 is 1500 rivets.
These must be manually shaken by the rhinestones.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the incident hammer, they will know if the rhinum is already trembling correctly.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
Nýt can rise above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
This is about twice the thickness of the human hair.
During the inspection, it will be the turn of the trained touch.
When the controller runs his finger over a row of rinds, he knows if one is off tolerance.
Only then he takes the exact dial-up gauge in his hand.
Letov supported the L-39 training aircraft program before 1989.
In 1991, not a single one was produced.
The company had to quickly find new orders.
It was then to be joined by a European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for a supplier of emergency doors for the A321.
Courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money for investments and for Boeing to guarantee long-term stable deliveries," Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain slammed if Letov had not taken the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the international aviation industry association in 1999.
I talked about our collaboration with Airbus.
The next day negotiations with the French started, Dubsky says.
A year later, Latecoee bought the Czech company and new orders came with a strong company.
Immediately in 2000, the installation of the door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck door was added for the A380.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for supplies for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoer, we would not have made it to these big jobs.
Maybe we'd do parts or small parts.
Partners want a guarantee of vans for twenty or thirty years, Dubský explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and after the profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
An exclusive position among suppliers of aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 special production processes certifications and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any aircraft door.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers, and in repeated inspections it costs millions of crowns, according to Dubský.
Manufacturing processes change every year.
They are more accurate and stricter.
We have to train employees, retrofit the equipment and again certify the whole process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is completing the preparation of the process for plating with zinc and nickel, which will replace the existing harmful cadmium for human health.
Although they were given the assignment from the manufacturer, they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The people of Boeing will come, they will check the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab.
One set of samples will be tested themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, the Dubsky approachs the way customers check them.
The reward is the Prague company long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today stands and falls the production of embryos.
Pro A320 produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for Brazilian or European manufacturers.
However, this does not mean that he can say any price behind the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It indicates how many doors will cost by ten, fifty, hundred pieces of produced.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We need to fit in this price pattern.
If not, we will lose, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where electric cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, are still empty.
But it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robook line for riveting and mounting doors for the innovated A320 Neo model is being built here.
The riveting will be accelerated and refined.
"This is the trend that is taking place in aviation," Dubský adds.
Sales have a future line secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3278 units of the new A320 so far.
Just a few meters next to it will be a line for the complete installation of the door for the upper deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The goal is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start within two years, Dubsky says.
Before that, however, the company must pass the qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic devices in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"For the company, it is a huge credit when it can process composites in addition to metal materials," says Dubský proudly.
Latecoere, however, is at the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more place in the Letov area where it is located.
Before the entry of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800 and within three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing compete, how many hundreds of new planes the airlines order each year, they don't have to worry about the job.
Although it has contracts for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoeer was able to communicate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, some of the loans exchanged for their shares.
Creditors gained a share of 37.4 million euros in the company by a capital increase of 57.4 million euros.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company has subscribed to existing shareholders with new shares for 222.9 million euros.
In total, it raised the share capital by 280 million euros.
At the same time, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which accounts for 85 percent of the revenue.
The average growth of orders expects four percent a year until 2017.
In the order book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four-year production.
French media say that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on drips.
The Czech race in Letňany, Prague, is important for the groups.
16% contribute to the group’s revenues.
According to the number of employees, the largest foreign branch of the group is.
MPs have backed a larger share of the state's coal charges.
The change in mineral extraction fees is expected to bring CZK 427 million more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, the revenues of municipal budgets should have a neutral impact, because the fee should be higher.
Last year, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from the fees and the state budget of CZK 150 million.
From brown coal mining, municipalities were about 200 million crowns and the state CZK 66 million.
The amendment also envisages an increase in payment from mining areas with permitted mining to a thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these reimbursements should continue to belong to municipalities in full.
Industry Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that municipalities will receive between 14 million and CZK 100 million per year.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but it is determined by the government by its regulation.
Reimbursement shall be re-assessed as the product of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rate for each type of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
But ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by a government decree need not be in line with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax in this case, because the state charges a mineral that is state property.
Fees are paid only by municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three-quarters of the municipality's money and a quarter will be given to the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of the extraction of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be purposely bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining emergency services.
The draft was criticized today by opposition MPs, who claimed in particular that they would damage the municipalities affected by mining and the regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have so far, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
The increase in unemployment in the Most region was warned by Hana Aulická.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for completion.
According to mining companies, the increase in fees will not translate into coal prices because prices are more than 90 percent contracted in the long term.
Therefore, major consumers as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
"On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in reimbursements by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in employment fees is tolerable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that MPs know the conclusions about the updated energy concept and, above all, the government’s decision on coal mining limits before the law was passed.
If coal is mined even beyond the limits, then it will have effects on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit at the mine of the Czechoslovak army should fall after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The entire world is watching the US Federal Reserve go to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly decades.
A survey by 80 economists polled by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would stay idle for some time and leave interest rates in the range of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's gone years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get off the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubife, a senior executive at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy was performing relatively well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global perspective.
They warned the markets to be ready for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20:00 Cech.
Sagittarius at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later the same day and his colleague - wrote a note saying he was "flying" the first murders and that he wished he could take it back, was revealed by government authorities on Tuesday.
Cops in Gautier, Mississippi, Lamb, a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called police on Monday morning around 10am
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife yesterday night" and also mentioned that there is a "cute dog" in the house that "will not bother anyone," but is upset.
The police demanded the caller's names, but Lamb did not appear.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When the police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb, which said: "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me.'
After leaving the message, Lamb set out on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University dean William LaForge said he didn’t know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “in Mr. Lamb’s head, obviously something was going on.”
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government authorities said there was "no evidence" about the "misguided triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce occurred 15 years ago, but both remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shaken" by the case.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, as Sun Herald reported, Prenics worked from the house over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he "doesn't go to prison."
When officers caught up on the highway near Greenville later the same night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods where he shot himself.
According to a CV published on the school's website, Lamb received his doctorate in education at Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett for cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was detained for drug possession in 2008.
All of these things are taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's defeat in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left the injury in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and think Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke through to PSV.
He was treated on the playground for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has suffered a double fracture of his leg and is now in hospital."
He will be taken over tomorrow or possibly the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastic and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will play this season.
Moreno was very lucky that he didn't get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw's account says: "Thank you all for their messages, words can't be expressed how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchester United recorded Luke Shaw injury in defeat against PSV
The England defender will have an added incentive to recover in the form of the European Championships in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said, "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because his intention was not to hurt his opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I was unable to notice this moment.
I only saw the ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see the procedure on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's procedure.
Does David Cameron know The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn’t take long to learn it almost by heart.
You must not be David Cameron.
When asked by the provider of children's schemes to name the popular children's book, Prime Minister Lorax, a hunt from Dr Seuss from 1971, chose the Prime Minister's 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A funny, touching, creative and with strong content, I was happy to read to my children because there was always a picture or message behind her that I hadn't seen before."
Well, except for the fact that in the following paragraph, Cameron allegedly described the plot of the book based on the 2012 film from the 2012 film, which added more characters and details to fill a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneeded-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes that he will win the heart of the girl of her dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is the brief content of the book, which records the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it alone was not suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron is read as a collective lift of the film Lorax, which is located on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In the city of Thneeded-Ville surrounded by walls, where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be acquainted with the story of a book where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the greedy, tree-cut industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title Lorax, a crouched, mustay creature who "speaks the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively small significant PR task was given to a helper who never read to a child Lorax 20 times a year.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from the office of supporters of Cameron.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by an employee of Cameron, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was threatened by the omission of England but still holds
Competing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England selected for this tour, I think the repetition of the 3-0 defeat she suffered last time in the trial series will be not very likely.
I wouldn't rule out winning the guests either.
Alastair Cook's party may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batch lineup and also collective thinking is strong; they won't only carry a 2012 juvenile positive scar.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England's team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough nut to analyze for me because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good attacks in challenging conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no question marks around Joe Root's name, which led to announcements because — and I've mentioned this before -- players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own fate.
Let's hope that if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, there's another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performances weren't exactly one hundred percent, and that's not surprising to me; he's always been a team player.
The question of how much probation the batter gets to show is a hard nut to get a challenge.
Lyth received seven caps — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could say is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean — despite the fact that Lyth was in his best shape — but this wasted opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and that's a batter that I rate very positively.
He's an x-factor kricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he scored 236 on the Trent Bridge pitch, which kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors have been given, but all this will of course depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while preserving four quicks, has been exaggerated and I have no objections to her.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't bat, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his country, Worcestershire, but he was the number 3 for them, and there is not a big difference in it.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He immediately succeeded for three centuries, and he did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, I was intrigued as a very impressive young man.
People can watch its gross statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and I see that as a boat, but there aren’t a lot of spinners to lift their hands, and the selectors opted for youth.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have made several changes and smart additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a batting from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for test matches can be a championship move.
He is one of the most beautifully playing guys who bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in part of the white-ball tour and brings both the energy and merciless spark to the team.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international Cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices telling consistent things that have been said before, can occasionally lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham teammate Ben Stokes got a one-day break, just like Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Although many disagree on this, the coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts stagnating by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-advised renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU comes into more trouble with every past day, even without the election of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to head the Workers' Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of them are their faults - some member states already have enough of the British egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty, which they mostly did not want.
At its annual Brighton meeting, TUC decided they didn't want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it the selfie agenda Dave and George.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home, saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants unobeying Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have gotten to the point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before she becomes bad, as was the case with the too long-established Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right side, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to see how they break their feet in helping the Selfie of the British, who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they themselves do not want, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may plan deliberately useless SNP style remarks during the pre-referendum campaign in the UK to speed up the Brexit process, a friend argues.
"Re-negotiation solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value from the negotiations."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the EU are pressical oligarchs barons because they were not inspired by Tony Benn during a referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They can vaguely remember the name Boris Johnson, a cunning Euro-opportunist who made his name for himself as a Brussels-based "EU straight bananas" correspondent in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of taxpayers paying taxes, foreigners hacking phones and pseudo-encoal departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she wouldn't put you in dinner and then to tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself, opposed Cameron's referendum routine, since Blair admitted the principle of the abolished constitution of the EU, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him a discard.
The press never forgave him.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who slamped me amicably on Westminster on Monday - I told him he was not allowed to waste my time - it seems in the danger of reaccepting the Murdoch Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy, which was a mistake then even now.
It may take some time, but he needs to work out coherent strategies to engage the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whom he left the BBC's seat on Sunday.
Corbin's official stance towards Europe is evolving, I'll say it nicely.
He says he would like to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the fruffy Ukip tendencies and the wild shores of Tory's little Englanderism can certainly accept it.
Hilary, "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said the same thing on both radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not have dared to admit that Corbyn's appointment of an abrasive McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70's, when his old father fought on television for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But to fight to stay "in all circumstances" - Benna's phrases - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of the all-day television transmission and especially in the whirlwind of paranoia and betrayal, which is social media
It is fair not to provide Cameron with a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to consider the support of the Workers' Party in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic tumbling on EU membership - in line with their Bennite-encing economy, the anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is the central essence of dogmatic bickering.
As with his twisting over Nato - Tom Watson, he is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end this - foreign diplomats will be bound to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain's concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed in the “weak military performance of Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of a Conservative government in power, as I was reminded of Monday’s launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking resulted in a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have a connection with the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet's criticism of the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by Public Health England (PHE).
The PHE news agency published a "measor" report last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the comprehensiveness of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the journal Lancet last month attacked an "extraordinarily flimsy base" at which the PHE agency set its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for BMJ have questioned the allegations that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They say the public might expect the PHE agency's claim, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to prepare an analysis of the decision of the multi-criteria (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on damages associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell report that one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the BAT public health credentials in the Sustainability Report, it says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from an e-cigarette maker, but not the funding it allegedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The reason for selecting panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industrial funding in the newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting at the PHE was also attended by tobacco management.
The report created in this group "excustly admits," the missing "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions is described in the PHE message.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claim in BMJ had been answered before.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
One of two lifelong smokers dies because of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small compared to, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and also what they do not depict, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die from smoking-related illnesses a year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the damage caused to smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, says Channel 4 CEO
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "give the right hand" for hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs that only a handful of people are likely to follow, into difficult broadcast times compared to its rivals, "the largest rating show, and on channels like the BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he was unsuccessfully trying to connect with the BBC for six years he had been working on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson said in the House of Commons Communications Commission, as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you maintain royalties that I am not sure about whether they are a good idea in the medium or long term, creation should be reduced at least in terms of programs that others do not produce or enter.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably meaningless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded in a contributionless basis.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and understandably produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I can't understand how these public broadcasting service are.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a businessman in the series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty by catching up on ratings "due to the ambitions of the people who worked here, and believing that it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows repeats those that former Sky executive director Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sells the show like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the more pampered BBC public service programs "goes to BBC4, where, quite often, the audience cannot be measured, but they are fulfilling their authority and they can argue when they are preparing to justify £4bn the income from royalties, "But of course we are doing all these obscure programs that no one is looking at."
They're broadcasting at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people for whom there is a lot of 150 pounds, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don’t watch the BBC so much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithov mission in the sense of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He confirmed that the small volume of production of the BBC has now been classified as educational - it used to be 1% of television production and 0.1% on radio - and should take as a model public broadcast in Australia and Canada and turn to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, of which only a handful have been broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so that we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics" or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how the sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
The researchers said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute at La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are injected into the patient's brain that stimulate the brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplified by ultrasound waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves act in the ion ducts of TRP-4, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to the sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a report by the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control nematodes using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he used ultrasound for such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to worms, where modified motor neurons switched on.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by fiber by fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissues without restrictions and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements shameing the British arms trade.
Watch a video about the anti-weapons market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drones!
Shackles on the feet that break the ankles!
Shatter bullets!
And electric stunning bats that cause unbearable pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and the karoture of metaphors leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the UK government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the defense and security facility of International Veselice at the ExCeL Centre in the Docklands London district.

But a separate campaign is also conducted with the posters of bus stops and meters that require a second view.
"Important announcement, Travel to the DPR from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using the font with the London Underground signs with DLR lines becomes the image of a tank.
This September, the swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DPR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms store.
On 300 posters, artists are created who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped distribute them all over London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs," which is £6 per piece Allen key, which is reportedly "take access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to view audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving into working with activists within the protest movements, realizing that they need to get out in the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms store greets passengers on the subway.
The video Amnesty video was viewed on Facebook by more than 100 000 people in 24 hours and was created by VCCP, working without a fee and a graphic designer and commentator, they also worked for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding adverts about the arms store - he saw an empty space on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Show them a campaign to avoid."
They were toying with the creation of a more realistic risky corporate ad, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we've achieved attracting more people."
"They have done a fantastic piece of work and helped us arouse concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that the tortured facility is not traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. military on the shoulder of the launcher AT4CS RS.
This includes a "uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind the tingling inside the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life in the Student Dorm
11 years ago, I moved into a student dormitory as an oblivious nineteen-year-old boy, still religious in berets and moral relativism, but only now I recall the tense smiles of those I have bothered - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving on the tracks can range from slightly on the nerve-walking to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babbling: to tell people where you're from, if you took a year's break, what's your opinion about Corbyn and why "you honestly don't even love Marmite, because people, it's just HAHAHA yeast extract, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath - ask and show interest.
It's driving the conversation and it's gonna help you find the people you love, and you guys wouldn't be having fun with even if your eyelashes were in one fire and they'd be disposing of firefighting machines.
Let people have space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie nights and communal public places, but they're also the rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college and being in a relationship
Introverts to college will come up short.
Your room should be a refuge, yet many dormitories turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
It could be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away, so I can go back to the energy I've used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a place of knock.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One boy in my dorm had the habit of not locking the door, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Because you started going to university at the top of the baking mania, knocking on someone else's door and introducing a slice of baked cakes seems slightly less strange, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I ask questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you, and it may all end up by assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and stiffness are likely to interfere with others pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Food theft is a common crime in student dormitories.
Theft of the whole chicken is, of course, a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check it twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're going to thrush inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more grown-up than my roommate, who swapped her milk for a dishwashing dishood to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It’s not just about being a decent human being, but you’re also a famous person in glass houses.
The girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could lower the drums and bass a little bit because they were 3 at night and had a test in the morning.
Their answer was amplifying the music.
When they finally fell silent at 5 o'clock in the morning, she let them sleep peacefully for two hours and then let her own music go out loud, lock the door and went to her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same dorm as you?
And vice versa, wouldn't it be appallingly embarrassing if you mistook the roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe they'd take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't trust your heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try at least talking to your weaknesses.
At an uplifting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about securing them by hiding something for them - never destroy someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock them the door and put the keys in a water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their things on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a rough time during her pregnancy with the now seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her and was alone in preparing and raising a child.
I dealt with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to the baby and I was looking for positives in it.
By uncertainty and being alone with the child, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for a long time, Eve remembers her first pregnancy today.
Even then, she met the older Vasek on the Internet, with whom they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Vašek and Vítek even brought home from the maternity hospital, but he did not flock to the role of his step-father.
"For a while, he then withdrew from the program," Eva described in the documentary series Four in the 3rd.
The motif of the third season of the Czech TV series is the search for luck on the second attempt.
She managed the care of Vítka and the financial security of the family thanks to part-time work and great help from her mother and the help of her aunt.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil Vašek’s affection for Eve.
They finally got together around Vítk's second birthday and he now understands Vasek as his dad and also addresses him that.
Although Vašek already has two adult daughters, he enjoys fatherhood at sixty and also devotes himself more to children.
In addition to Vítek, there was another two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually twins.
"Vasek came into our family somehow naturally, maybe even by the fact that my mother never talked me into relationships much," smiles Eva thinks.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
Twins Emma and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth usually subsides spontaneously.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vasek's happiness, even though they were only at 36 weeks.
Emička was placed in an incumulator at the intermediary department, where Vasek's niece, who managed to take over and accommodate her, is also working.
Elinka was bigger and immediately after being transported from ICU to my room I had her with me, describes the difficult period after giving birth Eva.
She spent twenty days in the maternity hospital until doctors agreed to release babies, which in the meantime managed to reach the limit of two pounds.
Waiting for the number of children in the maternity hospital, however, did not make it happy.
"I was mad with my husband and children," his mother recalls of the difficult moments in the six-week ward.
She and her husband were considering signing the reversal, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, this did not happen and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 21:45.
A large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric two-finishe and crammed conditions.
The house did not swell, but Vašek made Eva happy by installing a gas cooker to make the preparation of food for six people more comfortable.
If the worst comes, we'll take turns on the cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or shabbyness of the house.
For now, we've put together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross the rolling babies, but at least we are all close to each other, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side in any situation.
Vasek’s work of the lighting engineer in the film is not a guarantee of regular reception.
That's why he sometimes goes to Prague's streets as a taxi driver.
At the age of sixty, he is physically managing the care of the finances of the family and children, but how long will it be?
"I realize that given our age difference, it will one day be me who will feed this family," Eva admits straight to questioning the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not exactly a big deal for employers.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can take turns on a cab, she jokes a sympathetic blonde.
Apple has been affected by the yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a larger-resolution camera, a stronger chassis or a touch-sensitive display are in short the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple’s trend so far was that every new generation of iPhones is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generations, whose weight had slightly increased compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference to the disadvantage of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight increased by 14 grams for the smaller model, and the larger one by a full 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising, last year's affair by bending in Apple's pockets greatly troubled.
The chassis of the novelties is thus made of more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology for the new albums, thanks to which the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to provide the display with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the new iPhone displays has increased more than twice as many as previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one, then from 19 to 40 grams.
For the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty thanks to the slimming bark, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, the battery is the heaviest element used, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
The extent to which the new display technology will be practical will be felt only when used.
First users will be able to try it as early as Friday, September 25, when the sale of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will start in selected countries.
Have the flakes been breakfast champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglicec, Italy, archaeologists managed to find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from different times, including murals, remnants of tools and so on and so on.
In the layer 23A, which, according to the tools, dates back to about 30 thousand years ago, scientists discovered but something that is very reminiscent of the remnants of the breakfast buffet.
There were traces of oat grains on the spot, which apparently underwent the process of making such popular flakes.
In it, the grains are first soaked, then dried, get rid of the packaging, the so-called plough, then steam and press the flat.
In the Paglicci Cave, grains were discovered that were apparently heated or cooked, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least this suggests traces of use on two stones in the cave.
Therefore, scientists have not been able to prove in their publication for the PNAS magazine that the complete process of making snowflakes would take place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very noticeable.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly even warm is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting example of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes overtook agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New reports of stations in the Brno Public Transport Company.
So I listened to the reports of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Hnusáčková, Ghost, Prazova, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was somewhat noisier, so the report by a male voice was somewhat less comprehensible than before, when the stops were reporting in a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of the traffic, it is better to recognize than a deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than in the bus engine.
I have been living in Brno for a few decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners who do not know Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended, can be confused and can be confused, where they accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop at which they were supposed to perform was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of the announcer - but better again, the announcer - should be done again, and this time underscored by the normal traffic noise and the rumble of the engine, in which the whining of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we do not have to listen to the names of the stations Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or then the submersible in the squeaky schalon, into which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old manes' hearing didn't suddenly get so bad in the day the announcer of the stops changed.
I understood those reports pretty well ago.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track's notes.
Today, few people know what the largest and smartest were the so-called complex examinations.
I took the liberty of remembering that.
The bus was late.
I slammed into the dispatcher's office the moment it was said from the radio that it was just seven o'm.
"You're lucky you didn't collide with Comrade Chief, came a minute before you, and it seems she's not in the mood," the dispatcher remarked as I wrote in the coming book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write me, I'm going down the districts to revise the minor mechanization.
It won't work, there are checks today.
They're all fucking, even horror.
What's it really about?
"You'll see," the dispatcher sneer sneered.
Next time you'll be too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door of the shop opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, with a stone face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, and quickly buttoned two buttons of the uniform.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I quickly ran up to the second floor without realizing the cold, ominous tone with which the old one answered.
"You're messing around," said engineer Eva, an elderly lady I respected very much.
She said she was even a chief before her comrades deposed her.
They're checks, and you'll be there.
How many times have I asked what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they are once every three years, they all have to go with them, and it's quite annoying.
At least for some.
I'll see it.
I pulled out of the drawer fascikl with periodic reports and the phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me right now," the chief's voice said.
What annoys?
Now we met and nothing..." I murmured, but no one answered me, each with their own thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I came at your command," I said, and the ice was entered into the chieftain.
The chief sat behind the desk and looked at a little paper.
"The Comrade Mechaniser," he said after a moment, not lifting his head and still carefully examining the litter, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the light on the table, leaned into the back of the chair, and stared at me with the usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I was insecure.
What's going on?
Just yesterday, the deputy praised that in the last few months in office I worked very well and that he was very satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Remember, you're a track-offist technician, and you have to act accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I stumbled that I have been using such a greeting since I was a child, that I was so educated and that I did not see anything wrong with it.
It was like a red rag for a turkey for the chief.
"You're on the socialist railways, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work," the chief said.
Plus, you're still knitting addressing your superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the second time you'll say "comrade."
But I'm not a chief for you, comrade chief.
The deputies are the comrade-in-members, the top trackers are the comrades of the top trackmasters!
You kindly remember that!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a normal civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work or comrade... you know... I'm not in the party...
"That's not your advantage, you're not in the party," said the chief, who has calmed down a bit in the meantime.
There will be talk about it.
Anyway, remember that you don't have the chair up for retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn't look good with the person.
He stammered me for a moment with a cold, prickly look, and I looked for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his condescensed tying.
He was only a few years older and played God, actually comrade-goal.
jovial, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, how it suited him at the moment.
He was all knocked out.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all party members, told him, to him, as well as non-partisan.
But the chief was to many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He was hit me by the cover of bullshit right now.
I thought something about my ass, and it cost me enough to get so I wouldn't shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't go back to the pickaxe to the pickaxe, let alone keep doing the rail clerk.
What would I feed two kids?
And the house under construction!
It was crying, but I took over.
I won't make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go," the chief ended the audience, and began to look closely at the licor he had in his hand again.
At six-thirty, they summoned me.
Everyone in the office was already there, and to the questions of what and how, they answered, yes, it would be good.
Only Jožin said, as he used to be, that they could not throw us all out, because the comrade chief would have to do the work alone with his faithful, and that he is not in danger.
The word "comrade" emphasized, as if he knew what the old man wiped me for in the morning.
There was a nice gathering in the diary.
Comrade chief behind his desk and at the long advisory table other comrades who were supposed to decide on my clerical being or non-being.
Kadrovák, chairman of the ROH, recorder from staff, Special Purpose Officer, something like contrasting in the military, and a deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the strek.
An ordinary track worker, undercutting his sleeper or fork throwing gravel.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him back then, a pretty beast.
Evil tongues claimed that the school came out in the seventh grade, he didn't learn anything, he couldn't do anything.
And when they canceled the crime, he ended up on a stutter by the pickaxe.
But comrade, yeah, the comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unswallow cone in my throat.
The cadre read the opinion from the civic committee from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two children, and so on and so on.
So far, it's good, I thought, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then an assessment from the street organization of the party.
He copied the opinion from the civic committee, perhaps the same person wrote them both.
But then it came!
The parents of the long-time party members, refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief commanded that he should continue.
It was only worse.
I was a member of the SSM city committee and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who have stepped out of the party, the party has given me confidence.
But I got married, and I had my wedding in the church besides the national committee.
I disappointed the trust of the party in the worst way.
That's why I've been removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children baptized, and even my mother, when she died, I arranged a church funeral, even though it was a former party member.
I am showing a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the cadre had finished reading, only the chief's pencil tapping into the table's tanning silence was interrupted.
Everyone looked at me intently, and I wished I was far away somewhere.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could repair the switches without some fucking clearance.
But now?
The railway clerk's career took her own before it started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think I'm going to go, I'm sure the chief will go out for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade heard here?" the chief interrupted the tense silence with a question for a cadre.
Well, according to the previous job assessment.
Do you have it here?
The cadre clearly wasn't twice.
On the slices of the droppings of sweat, he blinked nervously, as if he had been examined himself.
He nodded impervically and handed the chief some paper.
"Wow," the chief said with a hint of joviality, which was often a harp of a thunderstorm.
At first glance, all praise, apprenticed with honors, studied industrial school, worked in a task wage as a locksmith, the standard was on average one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get that judge from?" he said to the cadre, who felt it was somehow starting to turn against him and that he might not have been a cadre very soon.
Comrade gave it to me, at the onset.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the trout," the cadre said.
And there the reports are not required, his was somehow extra, so I gave it to him in the folder.
"So when I put in the technical position, this scrap of paper was enough for you," the chief said dryly.
The cadre winking nervously and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss that later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was clearly relieved.
For now, it's withstood it.
"So what about you, Comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
Suddenly he's telling me, that's the end!
My eyes were cloudy, I was hot.
There was a torrent of remorse and accusations, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world that didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That by slipping an incomplete opinion, I misled a comrade cadre officer, while I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from a cadre in a factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element that, at the time of building real socialism, supports the shreds of religious obscurantism, indeed, participates in them.
That, that, there was a lot I've done, or maybe I'd still be done, and I prayed quietly that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I was flying out of the place of a mechanizer.
I didn't care if they took the pickaxe.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the Comrade Chief.
"That would be enough, Comrade Chief," the party chairman suddenly said, severely suspending the chief's levity.
Comrade made a mistake here, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, stupidity did!
But he's already given his sentence!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than to close the door to his side for a while!
In order to reopen it, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so well-read or parroted phrases from partisan trainings and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
A chance to prove that he has changed.
And who's supposed to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty of this young man, true, a somewhat misguided comrade, to support in his efforts to correct!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us.
Comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the chairman was over, no one even spoke.
No one expected such a turnaround of the situation.
- Least me.
"I totally agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief agreed in an effort to take the initiative again.
If you had me arranged, you'd hear that's what I was going to do.
They all nodded their heads in agreement, but they could see that they didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the position of a separate officer of the care of basic funds," I shrouded on my return to the office, and then I cried.
It's a good thing that, except Eva's engineer, they were all at lunch.
She listened in silence to my incoherent depictions of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was finished, she asked if I had coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she built water for the cooker and prepared cups.
In the meantime, she was talking about cadre practices.
As one testimonial, often full of praise, they give a person in the hand, and the other, in which there is any filth, they send to the new employer.
But I didn't end up where I had, but on a pickle at the pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cadren?
He just cares where he eats or drink, and that's how it turned out.
"He'll get it from the old man," she remarked mischievously.
He won't like it today.
Be careful of him anyway, he's pretty vivid.
And the partisan chairman?
Basically, a far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe with a lot of power.
Water for coffee began to boil and then the office filled with the smell of just potent coffee.
I threw a sugar cube into the cup and stirred the hot potion in silence.
I hope I'm out of the worst.
Now I'm not fired, and there's no more checks in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't just forget that day.

The symbol of the village came alive.
The wheel of the windmill above Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from afar because it is placed on a fifteen-meter-high mast.
People from a wide area call it "the fan on Chlum".
For the village with 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem, which the municipality acquired on the occasion of the meeting of natives in 2010.
"We applied for a coat of arms at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the emblem, everyone knows it in the vicinity," Mayor Jiří Mašek said.
The Chlum Wind Pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a bit of a memento of the present: it is reminiscent of a time when local people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It wasn't until 1910 that Chlum's councillors decided to make a solution, which then suited until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turn-off to Číchov, they had a seven-meter-seater well excavated.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into the reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě with a cost of 2 400 crowns," says the commemorative inscription on the ground-floor enclosure of the mast structure.
The pump after several repairs and crashes of the wind wheel expired in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the battle for water began to be written: a new water supply began to serve that day in Chlum.
The wind pump has remained only a dysfunctional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
They put the dominant feature at this year's reunions.
It wasn't until 2008 that Chlumsky decided to repair the wind wheel again and put them back into operation.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced in diameter by half a meter.
The wheel was fitted to a mast, but still the same year it had to be brought down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the appropriate material and the wheel could not resist the gusts of the wind.
Then the chluminian landmark rested for several years disassembled under the roof.
Since June this year, however, the bike on a high mast has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of natives, the village had the replica of the bike be modified and again fitted it to the top of the Iron Tower.
But the wheel pumps the service water from the well only into the overflow blind arm.
And over the summer we completely disconnected it, because there was little water in the well.
It was at least idle.
"We will then disconnect the shaft of the wind wheel from the pump in the suction basket again in the suction basket," explained the mayor of Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel has reached the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of this kind in the whole Vysočina region.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vyškov region, in the Kuželov region in the Hodonín region, Partutovice in the Přerov region or in Police in the Vsetín region.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, Tripoli's supporter admitted.
"I remember the match against Slavia very well, even my goal, like all of my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georghe Hagi at the time, it was a shame that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Just the difference we don't lose this time," Goian continued.
It is this man who has played 60 games for the Romanian national team that is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
There will be a few thousand people, no hell, says the Spartan Hybsh about the Greek duel.
And he partly knows what to expect on Thursday night.
I know Fatai, who played in Romania's Aspara with my brother Lucian.
At the time, I saw all their struggles.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name other footballers of the Prague club, so came a direct question whether he also knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and Sparta captain.
Goian smiled and was aiming at Czech journalists with a slightly reproachful view.
The clueless look on his face marked, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he started.
We've seen some videos and I noticed that Sparta is playing a lot of team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, it can be said that they hold the defense of Asteras, he is such an organizer of the game," said Stanislav Hejkal, a Spartan assistant.
Goian has already had the best years, but he can boast a very interesting football resume.
At one time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester teams United and City were interested in him, but from Steaua headed to Palermo, Italy, he also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European Cups, fights for the victory in the Czech league.
For me, he's the favorite in this match, but we're playing at home and we want to kick off the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very much looking forward to the opponent from the Czech Republic.
Me, too.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should have Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland due to trading shares in the company's stock on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have a group headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far within the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on the company’s events, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's headquarters, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is completing the prospectus of the security, which it will present to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding headquarters and the related transfers of shares will be made in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no shares will be offered to subscribe to the public or new investors as part of this operation.
"A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders decide - at a later date, either at 4. the quarter of 2015 or in 1. Quarter 2016," the company said.
The firm has previously said that any offer of shares could consist of the issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of a stock offer on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of the objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance of the news of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time the broadcast of the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did she stand?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can let today's broadcast of Czech Television Events.
About 80% of the broadcasting of the news was devoted to the migration crisis.
Only for the first minute when ČT informed about the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants on police officers called them patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal bars), the current promigrant propaganda was already going - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a large space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
The journey of refugees - ČT consistently uses the terms refugee or escape and not a migrant.
What is striking is that ČT consistently uses only footage of young children and women in illustrative shots.
She said in the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are 80% of the men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that is unparalleled from communist agitations.
I have to say that as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to get into a block of flats, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I got a fish on my umakart toilet.
Domestic fish, insects with an imperfect transformation, i.e., not losing that transition from caterpillar to beet and cub looks like an adult individual, only it is tiny and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't laze to exterminate them.
First by hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some blue crystals to destroy them.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, it has eliminated them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs the same way.
A box with a kind of juvenileizer that the ants brought into the nest, and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I took that turn.
As time went on, insects became the subject of my admiration, and I became increasingly in favor of the opinion that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have taken away from my life the experience that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can replace the other.
The truth of fleas and bugs I probably wouldn't hesitate to make karma worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fish do not get our necks, let them eat crisps of renegade skin, some invisible algae and so on.
Their peaceful existence was disrupted by a spider after a time.
It was a common species of the gossip that had been based on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought it was living from occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he spent several years in our country, we found out that he mainly eats fish and that his number probably maintained at a bearable number of numbers.
By intimate regular contact with every need done, we found that she is a female.
We witnessed romantic courtships with a partner about a third less, as he carefully strums on the fibers of the cobweb, so that he would not be eaten before he reaches the copulation.
It took about three days when they didn't move and didn't even respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't even move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of small spiders hanging hangings hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
They were deprived of their mother's work, they ran away from the work.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she left or gone, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the ouster of the toilet.
For some time from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behavior and, by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-aggression as a friendship.
The numerical state of somewhat multiplied fishery decreased again, and the spider calmly looked at its normal activity to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
In the meantime, our daughter has reached an age when the use of potty was already a disgrace.
We have tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already been eaten by us.
We urged it to use the toilet more and more forcefully.
But to maintain her habit, the daughter found an excuse in that spider, which she saw very well in her wiping.
Our talk about the fact that the spider was not taken by the happiness in the house at all.
With a cry and roar, she forced her potty.
There was no leftover.
There was a time when the spider had to be commanded in the interest of the developmental shift of the daughter.
It's left on me.
He was caught in a glass and banished over the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt ugly after such a long cohabitation, as if I were throwing a relative away from me.
We assumed that the ponds would start to appear more often and begin to multiply in a geometric series.
Wondering, a week, two, none of them appeared to us there.
I started to speculate on the cause.
I wondered if the spider was there, following the example of the ants, that the environment of the toilet was not as conducive to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were swarming again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured out that their attachment to the spider must have had the cause in the fact that if he didn't see it, he was hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator, and his rapid disappearance in them provoked an alarm reaction.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyes.
Some light showed shyness, but that they would react to the wave of hands or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that's left is to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wish into the air, and I hope they didn't give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use that Cyclond B.
The Ten Commandments of Albert Einstein, which have enriched the world.
The remarks of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate humanity.
He was able to immerse himself so deeply that the figment was always astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He came to the consciousness of people mainly with his special and general theory of relativity, which hitherto best describes the universe in its gigantic ratio.
It is also impossible to forget its clarification of the photo effect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the description itself and the system of knowledge of popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that it prefers to choose easy comparisons for closer acquaintance.
But it is not easy.
But it wouldn’t be Albert Einstein if he hadn’t found an ingeniously simplified form of explanation for this: An hour near your loved one seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems like an hour—and that’s relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing these ten from his entire plieds of famous quotes, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one at any time can prove that I was wrong.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, then what reflects an empty table?
I don't know what will be fought for in World War III, but in the fourth it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour at my disposal to cope with the problem that my life would depend on, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes by analyzing it and 5 minutes with its solution.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not mentioning Einstein's formula to define success: If We take A as success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep their mouths shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expected to change for 1.5 billion.
"It is a success when we consider that all four of them are keeping in the black numbers this whole year," said Governor Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly played by higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favorable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
As a result, constructions are planned in Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, which will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period when we mainly bought the machines ended.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, the top health care system cannot be done, the regional deputy for health care Lubomír Nečas justified the plans.
He looks forward to the changes in all hospitals.
Builders will come to hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, they are now selecting suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
In Kromeriz, they have planned an extension of dialysis.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new intern for about 200 million to the open central pavilion this year.
And the Zlín Bata Hospital awaits the long-distance construction of a new central reception and an intern, which will take three quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are the fundamental and often biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said Věra Prouská, the hospital's director of the hospital, for example.
The five-storey building is to be completed there in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for both intern and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
Changes, which are known mainly to patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are non-positionable, the windows are leaky and health workers do not have the appropriate conditions for work.
"For example, our intern was built thirty-five years ago and now it is at the limit of its life," said Pavel Calábek, the director of the Zlín hospital.
Within a few years, it will be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an urgent reception.
Doctors and patients will have all acute wards in one place, in addition to new areas.
The same model is already half-finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central reception is already standing and within three years there will be an intern.
"We will pay the building from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding as the only one in the region.
The profit is still the highest and did not get lost even two years ago, when the Zlín hospital struggled with a loss of almost two hundred million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase incomes and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients of the Kroměříž hospital will also be improved.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go into repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the detention station will be completed, then the extension of the dialysis will begin, or the construction of the building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

No one has explained to me how I should keep the refugees received in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains, after discussing with his European colleagues, that other states are pushing the Czech Republic into accepting quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but reject any discussion.
He also notes that so far no one has explained to him how he should keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you came up with at the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as with a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants as sacks of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have visions, they are going somewhere, they have relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to sustain migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were to be redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not get an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we've said this is the way.
But to say that the quotas will solve everything?
We were not dealing with forty thousand recently, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who are crossing over us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us to come, we just don't know how to hold them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, get asylum in our country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want to come to us, but we've already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Wouldn’t it be possible to accept more of them in this way?
We are committed to accepting 1500 people, but with a condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even the 1500 is that there will be 1100 people with whom we will handle the asylum procedure.
They come to our detention facility and treat them the same way as those we have captured.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe, whether we can detain the people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or Hungary.
Because Europe treats it in such a way that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may happen that even the 1100 will not be kept in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go to Germany after coming to Germany.
If we can detain them for the duration of the asylum procedure, we will deal with them the asylum procedure.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of European statistics are gaining international protection.
Then they get documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are four hundred people who will resettle.
This is the second project that is still underway, and there we have only made progress in the fact that we are debating with the churches about the possibility that they could help them get jobs, accommodation and so on.
But that's a long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting, other states were not willing to discuss with us.
But isn’t it that the Czech Republic only rejects quotas, but doesn’t offer any solidarity step to unblock the discussion?
What exactly is the solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany expresses the incentive that all migrants from Syria can reach them, the news spreads in hours after all camps around Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
This is the urge to further the migration wave that is heading to Germany because they simply do not want to join us.
We think that the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage those migration waves, to help those in need, and separate economic migrants.
Clearly let them know they don't stand a chance.
Last year alone, fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's offices.
If we managed to separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of economies, the fifty percent of what social systems spend on them in vain today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far is it to get border controls even tighter?
We were afraid of a capture in the order of hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have a few hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, we will return all the people we will detain from Austria within seven days.
We do it standardly.
Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it is difficult and the Greeks - this is a completely useless story.
So where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three consecutive days will exhaust our capacities so much that crisis plans will take on.
Then I agree with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If the situation arises, the government can sit de facto immediately and in one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police with the army, let us say the customs administration, or the prison service.
The extreme option is the state of emergency, which has now been declared by Hungary in some places?
I don't think it can't come this far to happen to us.
Realize that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have the Schengen border only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen in order for this to happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of the debt at the last minute.
It seeks to prevent the declaration of bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid debts.
Footballers have also received their money.
Football Slavia stood on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings before the court.
Almost three months after the proposal from Online Services from the Pacific Samoa, over the roughly CZK 20 million.
Slavia attorney Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
I have to say, she had an argument.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavia became the great Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money arrived at the club from the new owners, at the last minute.
This is also proven by Slavia’s statement before Tuesday’s court hearing – the Vršovice club on Monday, just the day before the hearing in court, he sent tens of millions of crowns owed.
"Everything was paid between 11 September and 15 September," said Slavie Mládková, a lawyer.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Mario Lick.
Slavia also paid the fee to agent Alexander Losenick.
Already on Friday, the club also paid the fees owed to the city district of Prague 10.
Part of the insolvency dispute remains de facto only claims that Slavia contradicts.
Either according to the club, the commitments were not made at all, or there are litigation over them.
However, we are ready to pay the sums in the event of losing these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in the bank account, which we can substantiated by a statement from the account," Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that was overdue is paid," Mládková said, adding that not only unpayable or contradictory obligations are paid.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts.
Then all the evidence is evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the hearing to continue on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting either, but only in writing after it.

Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honors because they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world’s leading manufacturers can boast similar systems, but due to the difference in software and parameter control, FastMig X is one of the world’s top.
For those interested, delivery times are certainly pleasant, which are around three weeks.
In the Czech Republic, we have already established the first contacts that will surely expand after the Brno trade fair.
We have been its regular participants for more than twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before it, emphasizes Miroslav Streichsbier, the head of Kemppi store in Pilsen, on behalf of ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built in such a way that it did not fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there were no two sinks of soil in Stromovka in Prague, according to the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a journalistic tour of the tunnel.
According to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The driver will open on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel went to the road safer, but the cost is rising exponentially," Butovic said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the ground fell only a few steps from the place from which it began to mint with a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures were to be applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," Butovic said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
According to the original intention, the construction was supposed to cost CZK 17 billion.
If we add to this the VAT that jumped twice during the construction period, of the seventeen billion you have twenty-one.
When you add to it technology, land purchases and engineering activities, valorization and similar items, it is 29 billion, which is no longer so far from the 37, Bělohlav said
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, reduced fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx has announced disappointing results for the last quarter and huge reductions in the forecast of full-year profit due to low demand for freight transport and higher costs for the ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55 000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
In this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50 000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, marking a 20 cent drop from the previous forecast.
Analysts were expected to $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The downgraded outlook comes an average of 4.9 percent despite interest rate hikes, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transport of heavy or large parcels, which begin in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO of the company Fred Smith said the company "carried out solid performance despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in the manufacturing industry and global trade."
Holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90 000 to 95 000 extra workers, which is about the same as hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended in August. 31, FedEx received $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 per share, which was predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $1.1223 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenues to stagnate in its Express Unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger parcels and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit declined in the freight trade due to higher prices for the labor.
In pre-market trading about an hour before FedEx shares were opened, fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a 11 percent drop in a year and 17 percent below the record set 11. June.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days settling down on 27 feet long Honduran's mahogany table this week, deciding whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank's ornament, a two-storey meeting room will be a mural painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the chair of the Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The central bank has dual charge from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unregistered third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor too close to the foreseeable decision to be announced on Thursday about whether the U.S. economy is ready to launch when weaning out of an unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates on the spot since the end of 2008.
Although most data shows solid growth in the economy, recent turbulence in global financial markets could already scare the Fed for adding to the instability by increasing its federal fund benchmark rate - even no more than just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Clearly, the labour market and inflation will first and foremost be the most important thing to monitor," Lindsey M said. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is the cause of the nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% of the chances of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates only if politicians softens the slump by promising that further increases are in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed politicians would hold rates this week calmly, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now," he said.
If the Fed's politicians did, "they'd have to go to the extreme in their program statement and hold the financial markets hands so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets as it would eliminate uncertainty from how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to raise the rate of 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions to confirm the strength of the economic recovery in the US.
Yellen said that over the spring and early summer, she expects a rate hike this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of lifting.
And while inflation continues to go below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed politicians say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the leakage in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to conv (Music) shut down late last month after China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones' industrial average fell as low as 16% below its record high in May, when investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has been somewhat reflected in this month, and Dow is now losing only almost 10% of the May peak.
The Fed's political factor-sufficient market situation is delivering a comprehensive calculus when to start an increase in the interest rate.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be a tightening at this meeting," Stephen D said. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact it will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on on the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
A mere hint of then-president Ben S. Bernanke's in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" their monetary expansion in the market, triggered convinces around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed leaders can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "The Fed has a history of overhead movements in financial markets that seem incoherent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee policymaking that pushed for rate hikes, cited the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings " despite limited identifiable impacts on growth in the U.S.," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should prefer concerns about financial stability only during the Great Crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's securities committee.
The latest tumult does not even come close to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Institute for International Economy, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should get to the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood and not a Thai neighborhood.
The market/warehouse is the only contact point that offers a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to crawl through all the alleys.
If you're hungry from all this shopping, go for a meal at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has different consumption points.
What's in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and a lot of items are sold in bulk.
The limit of fresh products belongs to special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and others.
The spread of meat is large, for example, fish - the employees behind the counter will wash and bone, even fry it for you, if you wish,
A good part of the store is left to the massive freezer compartment, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, cowhide and bile, pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, also independent families and individuals.
The wide streets meet shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh moonong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in the industrial part of Los Angeles, surrounds the outskirts of Chinatown and the center - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not hard to find.
The speed on the highways will remain with the old.
Acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the House.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit up to 150 km/h under favorable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House decided to take the Senate amendment, which refused to increase speed.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now go to the president.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that he would veto the tax-fifty-kilometre speed.
The increase was also opposed by the Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for ANO), according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, Ťok supported the Senate version of the law in front of MPs.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, to increase the speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane.
The Chamber of Deputies first extended this possibility to highways, on which it could be driven in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also took out the authorization of the transport police to have the last word when modifying local roads, which are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also envisages that sewerage, water pipes or public lighting cables can be stored longitudinally under the road surface.
Municipalities would thus save on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads regardless of the owner of the relevant land.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and facilitate the management of towed vehicles that the owners do not subscribe to.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which their owners will not register for within six months of the time after the towing notification.
Municipalities will have the possibility to exclude transit freight transport through their territory on second and third-class roads under the threat of a fine even for forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic vignettes instead of existing paper vignettes, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money for the introduction of an electronic system.
The Usti ex-mayor goes to court.
For overpriced welcoming citizens, he faces 10 years.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced project of Welcome Citizens.
Police wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal classification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the state prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns in damage, according to the indictment.
The prosecutor relies on an expert opinion.
According to the prosecutor, the former members of the city leadership unjustifiably made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcome of citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the municipality department of municipal services, education and culture to address five connected companies in the tender.
When another company that offered the lowest price entered the competition, the town hall canceled the competition.
The contract was then supposed to be entrusted to the administrator and only Darothore entered the competition, which the city council then awarded the contract.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both accused, led by the aim of ensuring the award of a public contract for the organization of the event Welcome to the citizens in Ústí nad Labem for a long time and coordinated manner, at least in violation of the requirement for a procedure with the care of a proper manager, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothre will subsequently bill Ústí nad Labem for the implementation of the event Were Welcome Citizens to the price, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert opinion, by at least a million crowns overpriced.
Mandík has previously denied any violations of the law.
I have not committed a crime, I am innocent.
I do not understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was provided by Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
Criminologists originally wanted to charge MP Kailová, who was also a member of the city council.
The Chamber of Deputies did not extradidate her for prosecution.
In her case, the criminalists have postponed the case, but they expect to charge Kailová after her parliamentary mandate ends.
The welcome of citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift cheque for 5 thousand crowns for the purchase of children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police officers reportedly released a dog for a fugitive.
Then they made journalists delete the footage.
Hungarian police are said to have briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a footage on which a police dog allegedly knocked a refugee to the ground.
The Hungarian government disputes this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday evening when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia across the cornfield near the Hungarian city of Röszke.
Police officers intervened against the refugees and one of them had a dog attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I am a refugee," he knocked, according to the museum.
One of the police officers noticed that the Museum filmed and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was not allowed to call either his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
The museum lost the result of a two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman, Zoltan Kovács.
She described the behavior of the police officers as unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not worrying that the government would destroy legally obtained material.
Kovács, citing a police report, challenged Muzi's account of the events.
He said the police just wanted the reporter to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said were entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to erase anything.
"Doss can bark - they're trained to deter and a little bit of fear, but they haven't attacked for sure," Kovács said.
The unpredictable Champions League.
Winning at City kicks us, Juventus believes
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the home City coach.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many opportunities, but we had the ball on the cleats longer.
"The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team conceded in a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
Last season's finalist Juventus was exactly the opposite before the clash - after the first three rounds of the Italian league as the defending champion, he has only a point and with a score of 2:4 he is in 16th place in the table.
That’s why the turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports before the new season - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal.
Pogba, Mandzuk and Morata were replaced in Manchester.
"It's like that, this victory is terrestrial, hopefully thanks to him we will go on the winning streak," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
In the second half we were better, especially in the attacking phase.
This result is worthy of my players.
"Before our equalizing goal, we could have scored 0:2, but Gianluigi kept us," said Allegri's goalie Buffon.
"We're burning some good chances," said Yayu Touré, the City midfielder.
We have to take the experience from the Champions League and try a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, Goodbye Old Germany II.
Before we continue the issue of immigrants, we should realize that the whole media frenzy around is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and media are full of children who carry on their parents' hands on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this evokes in a person - that is, in the European man - an automatically sense of guilt and compassion.
Well, they don't just come here desperate children, notice in the footage of the landing boats to the Greek islands that the children are not so visible on them!
Well, some lately, pictures of ships heading to Lampedusa, refugees in front of the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenade lie thousands of young men.
For most young blacks.
And also the pictures from Callais disappeared, where these eat, and black men are waiting to see if they can crawl through the tunnel under La Manche.
I don't think he's touching it anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was falsehood.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it somehow hides that it is not only the unfortunate children of Syria, but also the exposed - for the elderly: fashionably handsome - young men.
Whose musculatures look like they've just climbed out of a fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish-Muslim - parts of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Regardless of the fact that she was private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no hams.
And they got off the young blacks.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all clothes in designer clothes and shoes. In hands, of course, smartphones.
That it is a private beach, they were not interested, and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - were clearly afraid of them.
They occupied all the deckchairs.
Whoever did not lay on it and was just in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the cap with nail, white and colorful adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started to feast.
They occupied the tables around, crowded next to the sitting swarm and white guests of the bar - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere quiet.
Incoming blacks drank beer straight from the third - how in the series from the USA?! - threw empty bottles around each other on the beach.
They were screaming loudly at each other.
It was not English.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - they were screaming and screaming in the water, mothers with children and pensioners fled horrified, and in half an hour, not a single unblack guest was on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter told me half-voice in the evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive cross of gold on his neck about twenty centimeters.
And women were like a jewellery shop.
"Are these drugs smugglers?" I asked.
"You've seen how they're drinking," the waiter replied.
They don't fuck or use drugs.
They've been smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
In June 2015 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what would happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known the first.
I don't think they knew.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at the time.
And they go and go and go.
Today it turns out that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and related lobbyist and economically important groups have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognized main force in Europe - are lying, lying and lying - but not only by them, also the leaders of the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images about the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of images of Moscow television from August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sun-seekers at the station, but mainly - the Old German - Muslims welcomed their fellow countrymen.
For weeks they gibberish on the news on Czech Television, as the Germans say, according to some research, are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But who was only in Germany for a few days knows that it is a lie like a tower.
This is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous opinion poll research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to accept even more refugees a week ago.
Our TVs also had it.
However, they concealed what the next day broke in Germany: that in the poll vote for the article, 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - 67 000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly in November 2010, five years ago, said: "Our efforts for 'multi-culti's society have totally failed."
She then said, "Germany is waiving the struggle for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to coexist have completely failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has worked. They're living here with us today, and we've been kidding each other for some time, that they wouldn't stay away, that one day they'd disappear again.
But that's not reality.
A multicultural approach, when we say that we simply live happily next to each other, this approach has failed.
He has completely failed.
But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is increasing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who reportedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one that Berlusconi said in the EU parliament could play a supervisor in a concentration camp - as he has already shown up from the minute.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that have been victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
Who have been trying for years to deal with their terrible past of the aggressor and the millionaire killer?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany is to sow the devil of aggression, superiority and violence in the soul?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right the truth when he stopped all his strength the attempts of the Greater Germans to dominate the entire center of Europe?
When did he say that the great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he had.
When they shut it down, preparation for World War 1 began.
The idea of the Greater German region, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars, which cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the attempt of Marxists to take over the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, in Germany, for example, ecology, which was one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, so they left in peace all those anti-atomic fighters, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supported the old imperial and Nazi slogan Our Forest must live.
To satisfy the troubled young people who everywhere in the world want to do something differently and better, they fully sided with the fighters against the heating of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they have forgotten that there is also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and the anti-Slavic current, which considers all the Slavs to be a difficult verbiage - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after the parents of the Jews, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulz and German ministers showing openly threatening the disobedient eastern states, the idea of a leadership Germany.
Which must be listened to without agrandfather.
Otherwise, woe!
And when we add to this that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And behind this, as always, is capital, especially the German, which it suits and which lies with the fact that Germany actually controls most of the states of Europe through banks and the Union.
The pseudou of the sun-seekers first introduced the Germans into the sacraments of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it brought home and brings them maybe millions of Muslims.
Those who, enticed by the voices of the sirens, will soon hit the wall of reality Merkel, which Merkel does not want to see, and will begin to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with strength again, again it can some of its inhabitants - but it seems, a smaller part - ideologically infatuate, but in the end reality will catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim dormitories are already burning.
What will the German government do when the Germans' public protests break out against the incoming Islamists?
To whom Muslims living in Germany have long come to help, but certainly not assimilated in such a time as to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamist and Germans, who are watching the Islamization of their country with fear?
What will this do to the Germans, and with Germany, when the people who will loudly and publicly protest against the new Euro-savic Muslim go up?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict, which in Europe provoked by the support of the sunshine ideology, that is, the ideology of elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its greedy banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt act towards the unruly democratic Germans and all the inferior and unruly eastern neighbors, this does not go well.
Completion tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and the sturdy knocker will turn on you in a way that the weaker nature does not have to stand.
The revived head will wipe you off nicely and drive away even hardened, on the way away will accompany (or rather banished) the persistent seller and the living statue.
Perhaps it is a pity that a talking knocker cannot be purchased in reality.
Even in our country it would be useful to banish a lot of evisceras and scumbags.
Ražka's teat (Oxalis corniculata).
Tiny weeds that tolerate dry environments.
And so it is located between the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which is one of the expanative weeds, but visually creates a nice impression in terms of flowering.
Between the outdoor tiles is located.
She's inscrutable, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes drier environments, she is easily adaptable, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth watching it and photographing it.
Under the microscope there is only the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatric society Rio Grande promotes healthy diet when breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the knowledge of the importance of a good diet while breastfeeding using images of babies sucked from the breasts painted by depicting unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the excess of energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new surveys suggest that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic production of their children and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates although Nine's tries to take leadership in Today Show
The flight of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the costs of the aftermath of the release of the liberal leadership failed to create a sufficient increase in the rating for Today.
Morning show Nine screened from national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise with host David Koch and Samantha Armytage got stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem that this tyranny of distance is so much important for Audience TV, because it recorded an average of 397,000 viewers in five capital cities compared to 330 000 viewers of Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its rating compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was only last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318 000 in Today compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40 000 and 50 000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 spectators and Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more this morning than just parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are well, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to a seaside part of New Zealand, has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could tighten a TV hit without a Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a clear "yes"."
The X Factor from Seven retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, thus smoothly defeating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings of the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new TV quiz (from 17:00 to 17:30), presented by Andrew O'Keefe' had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623 000 spectators — which was enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat by Eddie McGuire (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520 000 spectators and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
The Hot Seat averaged 620 000.
Thanks to the drop in the second night of the year's The Chase Australia rating, Nine will be confident that the Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuir's show.

Three in the final agrees that the Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who will he choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently discovered who will win the Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood comes to the Bachelor is shrouded in insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who remain standing will certainly not reveal who the right one is, who will eventually get a rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they stayed only two, they involuntarily told us who was going to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut to Thursday's finale
All three women lyricically praised why Wood was the perfect man, quoting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positives as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, then which one gets Wood's final flower?," their answers could have acted as a spoiler about who wins the heart of the Bachelor.
As the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one that would best fit Wood in addition to them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a slight relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," Jeavons-Fellows claims.
"Sarah is a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They are well and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood might make a nice couple.
For her, she claims that during his last visits at home, she realized that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game - I opened my whole heart to him now," she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I like both girls anyway - it's between Sun and Lana indecisively.
Bacharor is broadcast on Wednesday at 7.30 a.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after moving it to the United States, and a lot of teams were asked after his great start to practice at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by the Australian rugbi league convert in the first kick-off from the pitch in Tuesday's 20:3 win at Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he has confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also still honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing newbies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to cheer them up.
Tomsula also endorsed Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received an encourageance from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only take care of the next game.
During the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club were hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing when he left the field after a mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 the worse start to his NFL career could not even imagine.
"That's what happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a record in his own goal area led to a trio of Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin to meet in a discussion on gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested on a Siberian runway.
After he openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts are limited.
The ÚS defended the emigrants who demanded compensation for property.
The pair emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the pair turned to the state for compensation under the Act on Out-of-court rehabilitation.
The court first awarded them the required amount, i.e. over CZK 2.8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim in such a way that it awarded them only less than 90 thousand crowns, citing that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Emigrant was defended by the Supreme Court and tapped them the originally defended amount.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the ÚS.
In the meantime, there was such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the then applicable legislation - even if at that time constituted compensation adequate in relation to the removed property - today reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot go to the detriment of the interveners as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been demanding their rights since at least 1995 and who have not had the opportunity to obtain compensation sooner," Judge Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The ÚS has repeatedly expressed its opinion that the general courts proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistency is not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, i.e. the atonement of the property injustice caused by the acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fišarová.
Radka Fišarová, incidentally, became the world’s youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of Argentine dictator Eva Perón in the first Czech performance of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Timeo Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague.
To return to the same role, he says: "To this day, the difficulty of Evita has not been matched by the many performances."
Evita is not just an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monika Absolon on the role of the first lady of Argentina.
I saw Monča in Evita three times and it was definitely inspiring for me.
I suddenly saw a whole new concept here.
I am quite a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is simply especially hilarious.
"The direction of Ondřej Sokol is original, light and contemporary," says Fišarová.
The imagonary handover of the musical sceptre between the two singers will take place on the Birthday concert of Monika Absolon on September 27 at 7 p.m. at the Studio DVA Theatre.
In the evening, the songs from the musical Evita will culminate.
The experience will certainly include the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Estiš your crying, Argentina!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also retire from the directorial disc when he represents during the filming of the filming of the filming of Karel Roden as President Perón.
Due to the interest of the public, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally staged by Monika Absolonová.
At her side appears Karel Roden as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strnáčik.
Legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who participated in the first performance at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police shot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police firing rubber bullets into a crowd of protesters against the draft of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a leading district officer, reports that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he reports.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the last week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they had set up a new province under the proposed new constitution, and eased their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a very questionable in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week to establish a draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly must not panic now.
After losing on the ice of the championship Litvínov, you did not even manage a home duel with Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the extra-league as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC predicts 60 percent probability of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands is likely to have a 60 percent in the formation of a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 per cent chance of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states to flee war-torn and poor countries. It doubles every amount of money.
Google announced this on its blog in an unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted the news on her blog based on her personal experience when she was seven years old fled with her family from Kabul.
“We have travelled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,” Masoud said.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigrant crisis in Europe, more and more families, like those of them, are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said all posts made through google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million would double.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them are coming from Syria torn by a four-year war that has driven 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly obese diabetics could be useful slimming surgery
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are provided with non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data take long to be displayed," Dr. says. Robin Blackstone, a slimming surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Surgery for weight loss, bariatric surgery use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proven effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the surveys were conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
The BMI, which measures the weight-relevant relationship, is considered normal in values between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values of 25 or higher indicates the overweight of a person, and people with a value above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a study since 2007, which deals with two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatments in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 at the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment of diabetes remained, roughly the same in value 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was solved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In drugs treated by diabetes, only 1 percent was solved for comparison of diabetes and in part only in about 2 percent of patients.
Furthermore, the blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was also demonstrated "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, according to researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drugs treated by the group, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - which is reflected in the better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the group of gastrektomy (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent) and were more likely to resemitism diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studying stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to life prolongation, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or MedicinePhoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about 29 percent more chance of survival in the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study has not shown improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone says it is a calming result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"It is here that this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a lower-BMI group," he said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also further argues that people and their doctors should start taking their weight really seriously after a decrease in the patient's BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long for us to show people the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once the build-ups these genetic changes that tightly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, said Dali Lama, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader of the Buddhists called for an end to the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in its speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compasssion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that, under the current circumstances, the interest of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, was inadequate to the refugee crisis in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dali Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that this was just a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he said.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issues of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, saying that "a violent response from the U.S. has provoked a chain of uncontrollably events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have been ingested by a sanitation agent in the last 4 years
Toxic centers around the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase from 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high-alcohol sanitation agent, according to the toxicology center in Georgia.
According to The Dr. Gayllord Lopez, Director of the Georgian Toxicology Centre, increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014 in the number of ingestion of sanitation in children under 12 years of age, the number of ingestion of sanitation centres for children under 12 years.
"Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
YouTube videos show teens drinking sanitation because of a cheap fuss.
Teenagers allegedly mixed a sanitizer with a mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive smell of means.
"Kids don't think about hurting them," Lopez said.
A lot of more attractive (sanitating agents) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitizers with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or orange, which are very tempting for children.
The sanitation agent contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several domiciles can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," the medical director of the control tolking toll center at the University of Kansas Hospital Dr. told Fox 4 in Kansas City. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a whiskey drink just lying around, either, but people leave these sanitizers outside, and when children get to them, it's a quick way to consuming alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four rooms of a sanitation agent with the smell of strawberry at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice the threshold considered drunkenness in an adult, according to Dr Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who cared for her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaiiah utters indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for any signs of cerebral trauma, because the girl fell and hit her head because of the alcohol, Ratchey reports.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, mother Nhajiah, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitation devices to be out of the reach of children.
Outside of alcohol poisoning, some sanitation agents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitation device that contained a toxic, undeclaimed ingredient.
Health officials thought that the product contained methanol, a deadly reagent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teachers by deploying antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and forbade their presence in the room.
Police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent chatter," and referred to the discipline of the school neighborhood,
No mismatch in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of mismatch in Celtic, while Deila admits that Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it.
The Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton is worried that the new reinforcements of January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
The first half of ADAMA Rooney's penalty secured Aberdeen's close victory over Hamilton in Pittodyria, giving Dons a five-point lead with each other and Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of discord
This situation has sparked gossip about the mismatch in Celtic, which was denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for the match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack in Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands representative Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no more rivalry between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently ambassador of Ajax, says: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
Because there aren't Rangers.
People here don't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at the matches of the Old Company and not only the people from Scotland are watching these games.
I turn things back to the good, Deila commits.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was stumbling a bit, but the Norwegian boss has committed to turning things back to the good.
Defeat by Malmem and the subsequent dropout from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and is now towering at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced bad times and rises again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about current events.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
Really, we really need Celtic support because it makes players much better.
Now it is very important to stay with you.
Warburton to care about January reinforcements
Despite comments that emerged a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is worried about a big booster shop and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox team's unity.
Former Brentford boss states: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer."
The players who come in the summer have a full pre-season period for settening, which you may have seen on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes it will cause more harm by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu's transfer target suggests retiring
Swansea striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic in a transfer window, suggested he could retire after his contract with Swansea expired.
The twenty-year-old gunman has been having trouble with his susceptible ankle for two years and has failed to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts to fight SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on the defender was later canceled - this is the third red card issued by referee Collum, which was recalled.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating: "I didn't question the integrity, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths pledges to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was strictly reprimanded after admitting that he sang a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh ahead of the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
"This was a derby and it was a heated moment," the attacker said, continuing: "I can safely say I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in the Celtic jersey."
Council in Tannadice confident of Dundee United - Donella
Simon Donellily insists that the Dundee United board still believes in reparating the situation with the current management of the team - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boy again for action," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for 'ugly win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen team had to hold desperately against the Hamilton Accies to win their seventh consecutive league win and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty from the first half by Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, whether by cups or leagues, without winning this type of matches."
Scottish unemployment goes unchanged while UK overall unemployment rises
UNEMPLAY in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 in the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has risen by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scotch unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK rate (5.5 percent), as the data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12 000 over a period of three months, the number of workers has now stopped at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - the figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said in a commentary on the latest data: "The long-term government plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market, and Scottish employment has been rising while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will be watching the man's death.
If that happens, and I hope that doesn't happen, I'll sit in a view gallery in the death chamber of Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip, who will be executed by deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials to witness his death.
I received the invitation first in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
Why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch the whole execution unattractively.
I can't do that.
I'll sit by the closest friends of Richard Glossip and create a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this kid.
We laugh when we talk.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to have a notepad and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'll just have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he likes it, get access.
I complained about her.
She admitted that "she could have articulated better," but she still thinks what I'm doing was wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help procedures against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a journalist from the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
It is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can't say I'll be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love to die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes from Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he rescued a man from the Canning River.
The man's bet from the Petrhu that would run away from the police did not come after he got into the shallow muddy water just meters from a police officer who tried to persuade him non-violously to return to the shore.
Canning Vale police were called in an incident going to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping them across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come for me,'" Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to soak his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactics and police negotiation."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning the biathlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threaten to end the races
Peeter Moody accused Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy in his stable last year and threatened to end racing immediately.
He focused on Racing Victoria organisers and integrity department and assumed that Lady Tatai's late scratch campaign against him had a late scratch-scratch on the race day, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidarina's positive cobalt swab that he can't explain.
He bit into his tongue about the allegations of espionage for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all going out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk up my head and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I would have to consider what to do my license after that.
Previously, Moody launched a bomb in his conversation for racing.com that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with the man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stables for finding out information about the things that are being done in my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because in an attempt to catch me they've completely burned me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL Chairman David Moodie, current RVL Chairman, and Bernard Saundry, RVL’s current CEO, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and make sure that people outside the coaching positions take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think they do.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will give them material to think.
But I got to the point when it doesn't matter anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will push them and transfer to them burdens to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The level of the coach's frustration increased with a long-term investigation over cobalt, including Lidari, and recent scratches made him feel like "he could "could have his license on the table for hours."
Mood, the most famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the rule of treatment on the day of the race "ridiculous" after the horse's leg was applied to the horses' clay compress or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three months of disqualification for the treatment of the compress on the day of the plant, for which the organizers had already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need the rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who escaped is arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobra over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the main road Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured driver.
On Monday, a fifty-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failure to stop in the event of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne coach Storm Craig Bellamy strikes back to rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, the Melbourne Storm coach, criticized his players' interventions as a "determining plan" with two NRL favorites of premiership.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "Wrestle" his players during the controversial Storm team's controversial victory in the Sydney Qualifier Final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, the Brisbane Broncos coach, made a slightly shrouded note on Strorm after his team won the qualifier final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game as a "should showcase" of the rugby league and according to him, two from Queensland were not "extreme" on wrestling.
Bellamy defended the interventions of their players and said they focused on "contact during them."
Bellamy added that this situation has boosted his self-confidence because his team is criticized by two leaders, which may mean they are afraid of defeating the Storm team.
"It's still coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us for 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed any of our defensive system and techniques in the last year, we have only put emphasis on contact during the interventions in recent weeks, and this meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how things always come into this year's season.
Bellamy mutilated Bennet's idea of "obtruding football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play the style of play, which seems to him to be cancelling, especially its young midfielders with their speed.
You would like to play football like this if you had this type of player.
He said the view in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It inspires more self-confidence in me because they say such things because they are worried about the match against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that in the match Storm and Roosters fell more goals than in the Broncos and Cowboys matches.
The Broncos game was probably good, I didn't watch, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are the breaks and non-scoring of experiments interesting?
I think they's agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at the stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and won the right to host either North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man wins bail of $200 000 for drug charges
The man, who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, who was smuggled out of Queensland, received a bail of $200 000.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of a drug from a Solay yacht that came from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomer in August.
Maksimovic was spotted during a meeting with the accused in the harbor during the morning and was later met at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that he faced a potential sentence of life sentence for owning a commercial quality cocaine, lawyer Maksimovice built a defense that there was no evidence that he owned a whole amount and that he could be in the cafe quite by accident and innocent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan believed that Maksimovic would flee.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
During the Crown Case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and stepfather Maksimovic jointly offered a bail of 200 000 USD for his release.
"After reading the affidavit of the two people, it is clear that the deposit of 200 000 USD is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts were clearly insufficient because the accused did not appear further in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was given bail on the condition that he gives up both Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police every day and observes the curfesing from 18 o'clock in the evening until 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an eleven-year-old girl to get photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep, then logged in to her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and found herself missing her phone and then found him sleeping Hogg in her hand.
She went through it and found disturbing the news before alerting her mother.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytics computers found an address and discovered "disturbing" web search using images of children to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that his reason was to "guilt pedophiles" on the Internet before he "pretended him to be a police officer and scared them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the search on the computer, but he said he just wanted to pretend he was a policeman to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted him to send another.
According to him, he did it to lure them
He claims he was overwhelmed by drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on her phone, he called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the naughty pictures on her phone, and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and talked about how the defendant was using her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to filing an action to accept or providing inappropriate images of children 14. June last year, violated the terms of bail on January 25 and failed to appear at the court hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on the list of sexual forfenders because he could argue that there was "no fundamental sexual subtext" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict to October for reporting to social workers.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody before hearing on other unresolved cases.
He was placed on the list of sexual forfenders before the date of his verdict.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gave a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African's oldest leader, has fallen earlier this year on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of his downfall became viral in social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tainted by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received anonymous killing threats that warned them of booing Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was whipped and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Chairman of the MP's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning not to prevent Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that does not appear, but is named 'death'," he told the journalists after a speech by Mr. Mugabe.
They warn the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as they exit parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is about to cut jobs by up to 30 000.
Hewlett-Packard abolition of 25 000 to 30 000 jobs in its efforts to restructure and save the costs of the company's business services.
HP will be splitting into two listed companies on the stock exchange later this year and separate the PC and printers store from its faster-growing operations of corporate hardware and services.
The expected reduction in job counts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and starts in the fourth quarter, according to a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending on the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and extensive portfolio of stores to help businesses move on a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will, see the company's annual income of more than $50 billion, and "will be aimed at delivering unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will create the company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, producing electrical equipment and whose garage at Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to manage the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of America’s largest technical firms, is the latest in the sector, based on the belief that a narrowly specialized firm has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also pointed out to Wilshere that it is still only September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, from the point of view of history, his involvement in the next summer's European Championship, is clearly uncertain.
The great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season severely after an ankle injury and then regained his former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury doesn't endanger careers," Wenger said.
It's a blow that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It did not concern his ankles or injuries he had suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
An unpleasant pattern is also created here.
The poll conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries by Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played only in 65 Arsenal league matches out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that at six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, he was one of the two Premier League clubs losing the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in the area of recorded injuries during the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you come back after an injury, you have a vulnerable time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he does and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal start campaigning in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur another Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debucha and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger could also start with Kiern Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear favourite to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not beatout in a total of 41 games after retaining a "unbeatable" campaign last season.
The stadium shook the earthquake of Richter 3.2 on Wednesday night.
This year in Zagreb was the tenth time.
Wenger thinks Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, capitulated against Monaco and remains as far ahead of the chance of leading the club to their first European Cup win.
"This deployment is tremendous," Wenger said.
It never happened to the Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in various shows is blatant, especially given how the need to open men to become more desperate than ever when dealing with suicides among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to solve this problem, Campaign Against Living Miseryly (CALM) marked the year 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help if necessary.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship for the fulfillment of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents a half chance of the occurrence of mental problems.
But in order for friendship to work, of course, it must be achievable first.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate answer is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money doesn't really buy more luck.
The beauty of Friends was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifices, moments of watching football in comfortable seats, Ross's desire for Rachel, they all stem from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with it, even though they mostly keep their feelings to themselves.
How a Samaritan worker explained to me: ..."my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old adage "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up on problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come to my mind when I try to offer a longer-term alignment mechanism.
He emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from more close, from the network of friends and family.
So if you are going to the FrendsFest organized by Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned to celebrate.
Or when you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep away Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blas Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored on his debut in the Champions League, helping PSG beat Sweden's Malmo team on Tuesday.
Here's the news of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's game, and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final 2--0 comfortable victory against Malma on the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored a goal less than four minutes after his debut in the Champions League, and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then they threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but to improve their journey to the quarter-finals they have recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it wasn't the classic performance of Laurent Blanco's team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and club, where he started his famous career in 1999.
"In the Champions League, it's not easy to win outside even at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and looking comfortably in defence is a good start, even if there are things we'll have to improve with the progress of the season," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we did not score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury as one of three changes to the PSG team, which suffered a draw of 2-2 at home with Bordeaux in League 1 at home, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moves PSG in Europe to a new level after the Manchester United transfer that took place last month and showed why he ran on Marc Verratti's pass behind the Malmo defence and sent the ball behind the back of Johan Wilanda into the remote corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start a spectacular PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the playoffs and made it to this stage, started with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two overcast midfielders were a tough opponent.
But apart from the shot by Nikola Djurdjice, who narrowly missed the distant corner of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they didn't offer much in attack.
Instead, PSG were deprived of the benefit of the attack by poor passes and a lousy finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who could not shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed much more appropriate when he came to prepare the chances for his teammates and it was from his pass, when Di Maria sent a spinning shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan sent the sixth goal of this season behind the line after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all Malma's thoughts about the possibility that they could make a profit from the match, and only Wiland's excellent intervention from a great distance thwarted the hopes of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of the alternate Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
The Malmo Age team coach Hareide admitted that PSG were class higher above his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not on the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off for Paris.
It was a wonderful match for them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion for Stock Sales
Mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which has been hit by the collapse of commodity prices, made $2.5 billion on Wednesday from selling shares as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore says in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to repay the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with commodity price-to-repeal, as China's economic slowdown reduces demand and sparks destruction across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore stock prices to the top of the London stock market on Wednesday in early morning stores.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that $2.5 billion share sales are part of broader plans to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares in the price of 123 pence per share, marking a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares totalling 9.99 percent per group.
Concerns about extending the brakes of Chinese growth reduced the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visits Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in a response from Barack Obama to visit Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama invite President Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to a state dinner to be held after the talks.
“President Xi’s visit represents an opportunity to consolidate U.S.-China-China relations and encourages cooperation to resolve issues in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on both states’ disagreements.”
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, should visit Seattle, where he will meet several U.S. technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for the UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to resolve disputed issues, including Washington’s fears of alleged cyberspying of China and its increasing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis spanned the Schengen area.
An emergency flare, detonated by Germany, has not cemented the European crew, but is already forcing the ship to change course, French daily Le Figaro reported.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the refugee problem first: it will systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees according to quotas on the basis of a quantity that is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the EU's 28 countries to redistribute 160 thousand refugees, the interior ministers of the member states have changed their priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who come today and solve the fate of those who are already moving inside the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the text under discussion of the ministers on Monday in Brussels said.
After the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that it is at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its decisiveness and increases pressure.
It reinstates border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the inflow of those seeking asylum in this country.
The Central Power makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under Schengen rules.
That it is a domino effect, but he also sees a blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy, and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private conversation with his three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is implemented stiff.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest rejects the introduction of any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others to avoid on its shoulders the camps in which the refugees would hoard at her account.
The real black hole remains Greece.
More than 200 thousand people landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as they have arrived in Italy recently.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came straight from Syria after passing overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial disruptions and waiting for a new government, has put their hands in a lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and the source of now common concerns for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The Juncker Commission promises that the checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but did not give a number or a date.
"The challenges facing Greece cover the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the intervention teams of the European Frontex Border Control Agency in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen the oversight of the islands.
"Simable financial resources will be needed," the text presented to the ministers for approval shall be warned.
From the point of view of law, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The issue of the creation of the real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching that.
The new emergency situation of the 28s has pushed the other way to the other side of the issue of binding quotas and 160 thousand refugees, which was already raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament earlier this year, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was preserved on Monday in a text approved by the majority of the twenty-eight.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only solid promise includes the redistribution of 40 thousand refugees over the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU hectic summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, German nationality is also a woman who was the only one of the affected eight-member groups to survive.
Previous media reports said it was Polish.
A woman in about a thirty-year-old woman was hospitalized in the town of Briancon with a serious leg injury in the thigh area.
The dead, according to AFP, were mostly forty-year-olds.
"The rescue operation is over, the bodies of the victims were also taken to Briancon for identification," Pierre Besnard, the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department, clarified.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the peak of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins measuring 4015 meters.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said Nicolas Colombani, the head of rescuers.
According to him, an enormous amount of snow poured into the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3900 meters.
Today, the weather service did not warn in the area of inadvertent weather.
Trpišovský before the match with Braga: Finally true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský managed to go through the Europa League to the basic group with the Liberec footballers during his debut in the cup and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
At the beginning of the main stage of the competition, Slovan welcomes the 2011 finalist Braga and, according to the coach, wants to impose her playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout battles, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal scored, we can play our tactics and we're not bound by just a double match.
"I'm very much looking forward to it and it's a real Europe, before that it was only a qualification," Trpišovský said at a news conference.
He considers Braga to be a top team.
He will be very active, they have Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be harder because he doesn’t have that name, but he has a player in his squad who I think he scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's an excellent team at the top level," Trpišovský said.
But he doesn't consider Braga to be a clear favorite.
I take it we play at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we showed in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from eleven matches of this season.
He believes that Liberec can impose his style on Braz.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time it is uncharacteristicly disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 setup with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"It's a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the pitch," Trpišovský said.
We studied a lot in the preliminary rounds, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted to training.
"And we definitely want to, even if it's going to be very challenging to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student films will dominate Písek, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works to the competition of the 15th annual International Student Film Festival in Písek this year.
Four dozen of them, which the committee composed of students and teachers sent to the final, will be screened from 15 to 18. October at the cinema Portych.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, festival spokesman Jakub Charvát said.
Every year the festival has its own special theme, which depends on the festival jingle.
This year it's a detective.
Richard Blumenfeld, the director of this year’s gala evenings, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we also need to resolve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said in a statement.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of student work - films feature, animated and documentary films.
They will be evaluated by an international jury, which will include the winner of the previous year, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the organizers of the festival prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbosmanson band Poletíme?, playful band Zrní or, for example, Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two exhibitions of photographs.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the Písek Film School and the holder of prestigious awards, including from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Cinematographer and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the discussion with visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the sand natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach in the studio of the sculptor Jan Novotný will christer his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also reminisce about Miroslav Ondříček, the patron of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and festival are his legacy that will continue to live.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences with each other and develop common ties and film craftsmanship," the spokesman said.
Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, will certainly help to do this, take several job auditions at once and gain a job position.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private Higher Vocational School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, Vladan and Miloň Terčovi, organized their first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years.
In the event of bankruptcy of CK, insurance companies are to pay the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay clients’ claims in the event of bankruptcy of the travel agency in full.
This was decided by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday when it approved a revised amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace insurance against bankruptcy with a bank guarantee, according to the draft heading to the Senate.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay the claims of clients even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the regulation, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to terminate the insurance of travel agencies against bankruptcy when the amendment applies.
The proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not European-comforming.
She drew attention to this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, Šlechtová emphasized.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-chairman of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to cease their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
The member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Tomio Okamura (SPD), disagreed with Kalousek’s concerns based on a survey of the CK member states.
"Stop showing us the lobbying of insurance companies," he said.
The statement of insurance companies is not considered relevant by Okamura, according to him, there is no official written statement in this sense.
However, they are looking into whether the travel agencies will be complicit, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agency of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about deleting the stairs to Czech travel agencies, also warned against the appointment.
According to Fischerová, travel agencies will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer said.
Her motion to release the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not march with the proposal to return the draft to the committee because of the alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip pointed out to travel agencies that he said could endanger consumers.
In view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, the rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová (ANO), withdrew her proposal, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance benefit would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not originally propose a minimum four-million-dollar insurance limit for travel agencies offering tours by air transport, and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The border will remain at 30 percent of the planned sales of tours.
However, the limit of insurance benefits will have to be such that in the event of bankruptcy of the travel agency, it will cover all customer claims.
Even after the modifications, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to indicate which travel agency is organizing the tour for the sold tours.
Travel agencies will have to submit to insurance companies, among other things, data on the management and number of tours before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment to the Public Administration Committee also envisages further regular information of insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to supply them with each month of data on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for tours and vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has not met any of the legal obligations to the insurance company, it will invite it under the draft to be remedied or will be able to prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of duty could jeopardize the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to newly regulate the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which will be submitted by the end of April for the next year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money last year, the financial plan of expenditure and the outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the petitioner of the law did not think about the situation that would happen if the insurance company terminates the contract of the CK.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who purchased the trip before the termination of the insurance will lose it, according to the association.
In this case, CK suffers a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One of the options for travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be a lawsuit against the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and in our market we will then act only as agencies, said the vice-chairman of the association, Jan Papež, the association's vice-president.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains the institute of a bank guarantee, but so unpremeditated that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because the bank guarantee cannot sound at an unbounded amount.
Moreover, according to the association, the change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, it will be necessary to recast the whole law again in the light of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies are now operating on the Czech market.
This year, only three CKs have ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth about twenty billion CZK annually.
Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must advocate for improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German provincial prime ministers.
At the same time, it again appealed for the distribution of refugees who had already arrived in the EU, among the twenty-eight member countries.
We must help the countries from which refugees leave or in which they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will advocate for dignified conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, the German chancellor said, adding that such a signal could be higher financial assistance or closer cooperation of the EU with international humanitarian organizations.
"The LT countries also support the German government in promoting the equitable distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis into European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, the country's Prime Minister of Brandenburg Dietmar Wowood said at a news conference that he expects real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among other things.
Merkel and Wobide also voted to speed up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities to start integrating foreigners faster, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg said.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on the care of refugees is to serve precisely to integrate those who have a chance to obtain asylum.
More teachers will need to be met in German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can integrate, they can become beneficial to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate about diversity, claiming that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of the HBO project, Greenlight was interrupted by an actor cast in the Brown series, emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives about black protagonists in the script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not when casting a show,” Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted indignantly with disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian got on the broadcast.
Damon and Brown have teamed up with a joint-known producer Ben Affleck and Farrell's brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to behave towards Harmony's character," Brown said in the beginning.
The only black character that is a hooker packed with a white pimp.
The Producer of the Precious White People promoted the finalists Angelos and Kristen Branccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in dissatisence with Damon's commentary.
Twitter user Mrooni expressed anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the conversation of a single black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is so WHICH is so white that it hurts."
The tweet has earned more than 5000 retweets and 4000 liquors since it was published.
Damon's commentary comes when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the killing Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took on a national effect and pushed for lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince made hints of the movement while listing the nominees in the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
"Albs are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest Black Lives Party leader, Matter, presented a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hateful group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported on the list of entertainers, producers and the media of moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depictions of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has the first winner"
Professional climber and pock of Pike Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and took home one million dollars.
In the competition, which just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During this season's final, two men made it to the last round, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb after more than a 220 m long rope.
Britten graduated from the first time at the set limit and became the first competitor to surpass the enering 4 stretch in the American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero surpassed it by three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for news outlets! News, after its hard-earned victory, and it was clear that it was still in shock at the $1 million main prize win.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never earned more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to his win.
"All of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the course of the finale and why Britten doesn't get any reward despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who completes the track the fastest.
“If more competitors participate in the track, the best time will win,” Weed said.
Although the gain of the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he's behaving a grudge in him.
He's glad he's been able to achieve what he's done.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero to her kids and a woman."
Geoff said to me, "If there was to be someone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I win, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit tigers walked just past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is in the last place of the central division of the American League right now.
Only narrowly averted the Tigers' defeat when they beat Minestota in Tuesday's game with a tight 5-4 result at Target Field.
The twins missed the chance to get closer to the Houston Astros team and captivate the second wild card in the U.S. League.
Although only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z, which was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
“Winning is always fun and it doesn’t matter how,” said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive onset and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took the next one in sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed an opponent 6 1/3 of tees and 3 orbits.
It was his only third great game from the last nine games.
"I want to end this year with convincing results," Simon said.
“It’s hard to get into a game when you’re often sitting on a bench and that’s why I want to get into the game.”
Tiger batter Victor Martinez scored three times and made 2 orbits and his first dropped point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was his first three-point match since the last game of June, in which he scored four times in a game against the Seattle Mariners.
"He leaned into it," Ausmus said.
“He looked good at training, he scored noticeably better and managed to bring it into the match.”
Thanks to three orbits at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins got the best chance of going back into the game.
Central fielder Byron Buxton scored a shift thanks to two points on the left side of the pitch.
Right-season Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to a set bat, and Simon fired Brian Dozier before he was replaced by Blaine Hardy's left-hander.
Hardy knocked out his only rival Mauer and had batter Miguel Sano in front of him, who blew the ball and circled two bases, leaving right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the bases and the chances of a draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send the third subway over two bases.
Plouffe has already gained 27 orbits over two bases this season and reigning the league table.
Detroit held the ninth innings, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a score of 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander knocked out Sana for three oversupplies.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes' game.
The Tigers won three circulations in the first two shifts against a retired right-hander who came into play after more than a month's break due to inflammation of the back muscles.
“I certainly didn’t imagine a start like that,” Hughes said, “but in the third shift I felt I was getting better.”
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes let one point on the other meplace Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the real J.D. Martinez was brought out by Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the bases.
Victor Martinez broke off his 0-21 series.
The third sweeper Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the pitch and scored another orbit, but Victor Martinez was switched when he tried to reach the third base.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and the fielder Anthony Gos got two and one point and a score of 3-0 on the resulting board.
"That put us in the knees," Twin manager Paul Motor said.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won the number of pitches, finished in the third inning without points and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three bases, earning six tees and 4 footsteps.
NOTES: Anibal Sanchez, the true tipper of the Tigers, ended the match with pain in the right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured thanks to outstretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, is expected to play in Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-hander Daniel Norris, who will return after injury and play against the Twin Towers.
From 30. June, when Norris was exchanged for left pitcher David Price, he scores 1-1 after 4 games.
However, he has not played since August 20 because of his outstretched muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field Stadium on Wednesday.
Minnesota left-thrower Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.373 ERA) will face Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open the economy to the wider world to boost growth, said President Xi Jinping to the group, whose task is Tuesday's governance reform.
"China should be involved in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving open policies," said the central group's head of the overall reform group.
Promoting openings in nascent reforms will give new impetus and vitality, it will also provide new room for economic growth, Xi says.
The leading group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, easing of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up in which sectors and businesses that are outside the limits of investment will be identified.
This system will be progressively tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will provide the market with a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring the legal business environment and make the market more open, the statement states.
The government will also free up controls on the powers it delegates to companies and makes sure that the companies themselves will decide how to manage their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy vis-à-vis foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," thanks to the optimization of requirements and simplifying the application process.
The provision of the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and the public prosecutor was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunhan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New inpatient wards may be established in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the inpatient wards of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient, and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
In the region, however, there are also possibilities of expanding care.
For example, in the department of surgical departments, a one-day surgery center could be established, where, according to the set concept, procedures of surgical disciplines that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be carried out.
In which specific hospitals the workplace focused on one-day surgery should be, is not yet clear.
In the case of the skin department of the Karlovy Vary hospital, a laser center could be established with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apalic center that would take care of patients with brain disorders who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of camping such a facility in the hospital Ostrov, where similar care already exists.
Another inpatient capacity, which seems insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region, are the beds of follow-up care, especially the beds of long-term sick treatment rooms (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely linked to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should act as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN beds, recommends conception.
As he points out, the beds of aftercare are mainly missing in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
There could be used abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, social health beds are absent in the Karlovy Vary Region, focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the country, so it could serve as a so-called Alzheimercentrum for other regions.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds for which the funds of European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will be linked to the fields of vulsuage specialized care and will form a space for the translation of patients after the procedure, for example, after cardiac surgery, neurosurgical, transplantation or other procedures," describes the regional concept of inpatient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
