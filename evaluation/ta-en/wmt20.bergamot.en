There are revolutions before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not a mere compliment that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given revolutionary movements and thereby a new evolution and clear ideology to Indian politics.
We can see that there is a perception among the people that the revolutionaries are just fools and those who do not care about human lives.
The Bhagat Singh period gives us their sense of humanity, clarity and ability.
After the bombing of the Parliament in April 1929, Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.
He was introduced to the public in Tamil Nadu in the 1930s.
But within a year of his debut, his popularity spread rapidly in all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most amazing news in history, and the name of any leader born in the North, including Gandhiji, has never spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.
That's because they're the father.
The week after Bhagat Singh's death, an editorial was published in the Republic Weekly titled Bhagat Singh.
The editorial appreciated many of Bhagat Singh's character interests and presented some views on the political situation of the day.
Some excerpts from the area:
"If Bhagat Singh really made sure that all his principles were right and that he had done to fulfill the models he behaved, we would say that if he had not done so, he would not have been able to say that he was a righteous man.
So let's call him a real man.
It is our strongest perception that Bhagat Singh's policy for India is really necessary.
Had it not been for Mr. Bhagat Singh to be hanged and died, this victory would not have been the basis for such a popular outcome.
If Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhianism would have been more incredulous.
Why did Bhagat Singh, who had to be sick and be ashes, had to die of disease and died of the disease, the mother who could give the people of India the way of true equality and peace to the people of the world.
We salute Bhagat Singh by saying that no one else can get it!"
Periyar said in a statement in the Republic newspaper.

That's why it's a short distance away from the place to land.
John Keller, deputy director of NASA's AROC project, said: "The LROC Orbiter passed the Moon's southern part of the moon on the 17th.
He took pictures in the dark in the evening.

Built in Mayanur, the earth's water level increased.
So agriculture flourished.

The construction of the dam was constructed by the Government of Mayanur according to the requirements of this period.
There was no need to build more.
If necessary, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu would have given permission for it, allocating funds and stepping up the work.
Therefore, there is no shortcut to the government to blame the government for the welfare of Cauvery.
I'd like to know how many times in the last eight years that the ANC has been built.
We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK regime.
Can you tell me that there is only one way to build a bridge that has been built so far?
Dont lie.
If the Leader of the Opposition responds to the allegations, let us know with the evidence that we are planning to build a check dam or plan to build in other places.
"I am obliged to point out that the DMK government has not built a check dam in the Cauvery river, it may be beautiful if the individual Edappadi wants it, and for the post of Chief Minister, which he holds, is not a civilized act or not a beauty," Duraimurugan said.

Is the BJP taking over caste politics in Tamil Nadu?
In Tamil Nadu, if it is not possible to keep the lotus in place, then the BJP is finally taking caste politics into their hands.
When Modi was the first Prime Minister of Tamil Nadu, he had to leave his hand and see the lotus.
After that, Amit Shah said, "You don't know what to do.
However, only 5 seats were contested.
The BJP is in power in Tamil Nadu.
"This is a triple talaq, Kashmir issue, Hindi imposition, one nation, one language.
This is all added to the mix.
That is why the BJP leadership is in a state of turmoil over the Tamil Nadu BJP leaders and that is why it is still difficult to appoint the state leadership.
The BJP is planning to take root in the upcoming assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.
The BJP leadership seems to have almost reached a conclusion through the direct report and the intelligence report.
Accordingly, whether it is the AIADMK or the DMK, there is a perception among the people of the respective communities that the 2 Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to the Nadar community and the Vanniyar people and the Devendrakula Vellalar people.
It is said that there is a lot of sadness in the Dwarves.
This is the tactic of the BJP.
He has decided to honor the pride of the community or to give importance to the community.
Tamilisai Soundararajan is the Governor of Telangana.
The BJP government is also giving importance to the top Indian government in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP does this to honour every nation, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of their respective communities.
"Whatever happens in this caste, the BJP will be defeated in this caste politics.
At the same time, it is not known whether the BJP's actions will become more oil on the burning fire, when Tamil Nadu is already in a state of disarray in caste politics.
It is true that if the caste fire started to burn, even the lotus that is now a little bit of poison in Tamil Nadu will burn in the same fire!
