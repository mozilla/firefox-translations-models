President Maithripala Sirisena said that the system in which graduates from universities go to the streets for jobs and demonstrations is emerging in the country because of the education system that has moved away from science, technology and research.
Therefore, it is very important to make the necessary fundamental changes to national education policies and introduce and implement the new educational systems of the developed countries of the world.

The President also explained the need for specialists in this field to focus on it in an era where the cooperation of science, technology and research sectors is highly needed to overcome the challenges faced by our people due to climate change.
Noting that in the political sphere and in the scientific, technological and research spheres most people do not think about the country, but think and act about themselves, the President said that the main challenge in the country's development journey is to think and act about the country, and that the country is losing the necessary education in engineering, medicine and accounting services because the educated people who receive free education leave the country and think only about themselves, not the country.
The Shilpa Chennai exhibition, which is held under the theme 'A country rich in popular hands', is mainly divided into five categories: enterprise, industrial market, new products, blue-green section and entertainment in the technology sector.

A protest was held in support of the Secular Progressive Alliance, which condemned the violent course of the Hindu front in connection with the attack on 28 backward institutions and urged the police to take swift action.
On 5th of last month, more than 60 people from the Hindu Front broke into the back-office on the Angripalayam Road in Thiruvananthapuram and attacked it.
The workers attacked and damaged the factory and the company's property.
And the police have done some research on this.
The incident was widely condemned by industry, various political parties, activists and the general public, and a protest was called on 9th, which was condemned by the non-secular progressive coalition parties of Thiruvananthapuram.
When the permit was refused, a complaint was filed with the district governor and the police commissioner of the city of Thiruvananthapuram.
A subsequent consultation on the matter was held on 17 September, when a renewed protest was announced by the Secular Progressive Alliance.
The Orp Batam, which was held on 17th April at 11 am, was held in violation of the ban on the protest and the refusal of the police to allow it, denouncing the "violent course of the Hindu front - urging the police to take swift action" against the Tripur Municipality.
The demonstration was led by the DMU Secretary of the Thiruvananthapuram North District, K. Selvaraj.
The demonstration was attended by K. Kamaraj, member of the State Committee of the CBI (M), Chief Secretary of the Tirupaur District CBI (M), Chief Secretary of the Tirupaur District CBI (M), Chief Secretary of the Tirupaur District CBI, M. Ravi, Congress Party Ramasamy, Matimuk Sampath, and other party officials.
In the middle of the protest, the police complained that they were not allowed to hold a protest.
The then secular Progressive Alliance party reported that on 5th of last month in Tirupur, the Hindu Front attacked a backward institution and rioted.
We formally requested permission to hold a democratically organised protest in Orp, but the police did not allow it, and we filed a complaint with the authorities and the police commissioner, after which the protest is being held in a democratically organised manner, despite the importance of the request, as the police refused permission to protest.
Police have arrested a few people in connection with the attack on a backlog company.
Still, the police should take swift action to arrest the Hindu front rowdies involved in the incident.
In large numbers, more than 500 people, especially women, took part in the protest and protested against the violence, thus preventing the police from arresting those who had protested.
A loud cry was raised in protest against the Hindu Front's attack on a backward institution in Tirupur and the religious violence being perpetrated by the Hindu Front in various forms.
It is no wonder that the democratically controlled Tode secular progressive coalition's Orp Patham has raised awareness of violence among the people of Tripur!

"If I do, people will come forward!" Ramsing said of the initiative, "it was possible to see people's frustration with the difficulties of buying too much vegetables, traffic congestion, pollution.
While many have complained about it, they do not seem to realize that they are thinking about an alternative or that they have a solution.
And the only real solution to this is that if I do what I believe in, people will follow suit.
So my wife and I walk 10 kilometers once a week to buy vegetables.
And since it went on for six months, it's now become a habit.
And now I am very satisfied mentally".
"Many said it was difficult to walk with so many vegetables on their hands, so I suggested that they carry a bamboo basket to fight the plastic threat.
But when they heard it, they laughed.
So my wife and I went to the market carrying a basket of bamboo.
It was then that I realized that it would be very helpful in many ways.
Many young people these days are not in good health.
I think they should start walking and control their eating.
I am a firm believer that only the traditional method can provide the best solutions to the new challenges of the modernised world.
One can be in complete health if one handles the traditional methods". says Ram Singh I.A.S.

Heart disease, including heart attack, is the number one cause of death globally.
Heart disease in India is on the rise.
Young people are also affected by heart attacks.
If we are conscious and keep our bodies safe, we can prevent heart disease by 80 percent.
If our grandparents have heart disease, we are more likely to have heart disease.
If we maintain a healthy lifestyle, we can prevent heart disease from developing to a lesser extent.
In modern medicine, it is possible to predict who will have a heart attack.
If detected early, heart attacks can be prevented.
Even if a heart attack occurs, it can be cured quickly.
And so he said.
The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period of Chief Minister of Sikkim, Bremsing, who was convicted of corruption, from six years to one year and one month.
This has removed the barrier to Tamang's bid for re-election.
Sikkim Assembly elections were held in conjunction with the Lok Sabha elections.
The Sikkim Grandigarhi Morcha won the election by a landslide.
The party's leader, Bremsing Damang, took over as chief minister.
But in a corruption case in 2016, a lower court sentenced Tamang to prison.
He was sentenced to prison because the Supreme Court confirmed this.
The controversy erupted as Tamang took office because a man who had been sentenced to prison for corruption could not contest elections for six years.
In this case, Tamang is running in the Sikkim Assembly by-election.
With the support of the BJP, Tamang is governing Sikkim.
Meanwhile, Tamang had sent a letter to the Election Commission pointing to various legal provisions and demanding that the six-year ban on running for office be lifted.
The Election Commission, which has considered this letter, has announced that it will reduce the period of the ban on Tamang from one year to one month.
This does not prevent Tamang from running in the by-election.
The BJP can now start its politics in other states, including Tamil Nadu, using the offer given to Tamajang.
The election commission and the reports that it executes may also issue the BJP's wishes in full.

There have been revolutionary movements before and after Bhatta Singh.
But it is no mere compliment that Bhagat Singh and his companions have thus given revolutionary movements a new evolution and clear ideology to Indian politics.
We can still see a common opinion among the people today that revolutionaries are just fools and that they are the only people who don't care about human life.
The era of the Bhagathsings reminds us of their humanity, clear thinking and ability.
In April 1929, after a bombing of the assembly, the name of the Bhagat Singh spread to India.
Tamil Nadu was still a bit delayed and it was not until 1930 that he was introduced to the public.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly even to every corner of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most amazing news in history, as no leader born in North Nadu, including Gandhi, has ever been named, spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
This is because of Father Periyar and they are the reason.
The week after the assassination of Bhagath Singh, an editorial titled Bhagath Singh appeared in the Republic Weekly.
The editorial praised many of the characteristic interests of Bhagata Singh and also offered some comments on the political situation of the day.
Some excerpts from the editorial are:-
"In fact, we will say that if the Bhagta Singh was convinced that all his policies were right and that the patterns he followed were the right path to follow, and if he was determined to follow his own path, we would say that he should certainly follow his own path and that if he did not follow his own path, he could not be said to be a lucky man.
So now let's say he was a real man.
It is our strong belief that India really needs the policy of Bhagat Singh.
If Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and left alive, there would have been no basis for this success to become so popular.
And we can say that if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhi would still have been inspired.
A self-made illness that would eventually lead to her dying and dying of asphyxiation, Bhagat Singh, was a useful mother to the Indian people, who would have to give up her life to show the world a path to true equality and peace.
We praise Bhagath Singh with all our heart, mouth, and tongue, saying that he is a majority that no one else can achieve by ordinary means!"
"This is what Father Periyar said in the editorial of the Republican newspaper.
A police officer named Dennis Turner, who was a police officer at the school where the incident took place, has arrested a girl who was being held in the school for assaulting a teacher.

The Ministry of Education has said that while the recommendation of the Committee on the Elimination of Wages Conflict on the Public Services Committee to increase the salaries of all government employees, including teachers and principals, is ready to be implemented from January 1 next year, it is a great injustice for teachers and principals who base their wage conflict on not socializing to service during a health holiday.
To participate in trade union activities is a right of employees.
It is not challenged, but even after learning of the potential wage increases, it is not appropriate for a smart respectable profession such as the teachers' chiefs to engage in occasional activities of unions that are used as a strategy to deceive members by pointing out the success obtained by their actions.
In July 2015, the Minister of Education, Akilviraj Karevassam, said in Parliament that the salaries of teachers and presidents were substantially increased by 106 percent and that the increase in salaries was the latest undertaken by any government.

The Wickralender is firmly attached to the lunar surface.
NASA's LROC Orbiter captured a picture of the landing site of the 28ta Chandrayaan-2's Vikram lander, which crashed strongly into the south pole of the moon.
The Vikram lander of the ISRO-led lunar probe Chandrayaan-2 landed at the south pole of the moon on 7 December.
But, at the last moment, communication with him was cut off.
Since the Vikram lander crashed into the lunar surface rather than slowly landing, it was thought that it might have suffered damage and that communication had been cut off.
In this case, NASA's LROC orbiter passed the south pole of the moon on 17 December.
Then, Vikram Lan Turta captured and sent the most sophisticated way to film the plain area between the two mosquitoes, Simpe Lius N and Mancinus C, that landed on the land.
The examination of these images has confirmed that the Vikram lander crashed to the ground with a strong impact.
That's why it would fall a little further from where it was supposed to land.
John Keller, NASA's Assistant Director of the EROC Project, said: "The LROC orbiter passed the south pole of the Earth on the 17th.
Then, it sent pictures taken at the darkest hour of the evening.
The investigation revealed that the Vikram lander crashed into the ground with a strong impact.
However, the Vickram lander was unable to locate the exact landing site.
LROC R Peter will again pass the South Pole on the 14th of next month.
Since the light will be fine then, there is a better chance of capturing the Vikram lander".

We do not see terrorism as a challenge for India alone.
We see it as an act against the whole world and against humanity.
Therefore, the whole world must unite against terrorism.

And there are no conceptual differences.
Today, I say the same thing on behalf of the world's largest democracy.
The only message we can give the world is 'peace and harmony.'"

The meeting of the IIT Council has decided that the fees of all Indian technical educational institutions will be increased tenfold.
The Institute of Technology, also known as Industrial Technology Institutions, plays a major role in developing talented students across India.
The meeting of the IIT Council, which included the directors of 23 IIT educational institutions operating under the Department of Human Resource Development of the Central Government, was held on 28.9.2019 under the chairmanship of Union Minister Ramesh Bhogri.
The decision taken at that meeting has left students and the public shocked.
It has been decided to increase the tuition fee for M.Tech. at IIT by 10 times.
All the institutes in India are charging tuition fees ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 per semester.
In this case, the fee has now been increased to Rs 2 lakh per annum.
Out of the 12 first-year students in the 2019-2020 school year, 9,280 students are eligible for scholarships.M.Tech. has also decided to suspend the monthly scholarship of Rs 12,400 to students.
The central government is going to cut funding for the IITs in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karagpur, Kanpur, Roorkee, Gaukathy.
To address this shrinking funding, the central government has raised the fee to collect that funding from students.
Furthermore, the respective institutions that keep the money available through construction works that can be done by their respective technical education institutions are reportedly advised to carry out development work, to borrow from the bank and to receive money from corporate companies.
Since coming to power, the BJP has been blocking education from the common people to the extent possible, cutting funding for primary education in the 2015 financial statements, and subsequently significantly cutting funding for education during each financial statements.
This was followed by the continuing push by big investors to start educational institutions to make private educational institutions more accessible.
In this context, the new education policy has imposed various regulations that require educational institutions to operate under private funding without giving any emphasis to public educational institutions.
By this, the central government has shifted the country to a level where only the most affluent can get basic education from higher education to higher education, and is working to take India's prosperous future back hundreds of years as an uneducated nation.
The book "The Art of Comic Book" by Ranuta, was given to the editor of the Kalakamal magazine, Dr. Delahampur Sankara Subramanian, to publish it, by former IAS officer Kapura Sundarabandyan.
The launch of the book "Comic Art" by the late "cartoonist" Ranu, S.K. Ramanujan, took place on Sunday at the Russian Cultural Center in Chennai.
The ceremony was presided over by B. Danganappan, Secretary of the Indo-Russian Chamber of Commerce.
At the event, the editor of the Kalamachar magazine, Dr. Vallaampur Sankara Subramanian, was given the opportunity to publish the first volume, while R. Kapura Sundara Pandiyan, a former IAS officer and the chairman of the Siddharth Research Centre, was given the opportunity to do so.
At the event, attended by Gandh, Kapoora Sundarapandian speaking as a special guest, said:-
The late cartoonist Ranu Ramanujam was a master of comic art.
Ranuta has produced and educated a large number of students through the Cartoon Study and Education Foundation.
As a matter of fact, even if one is a person who is being maligned by the world, he is not maligned by his family.
On the contrary, cartoonist Ranu, who wrote his book after his death, is proud to say that the family has been the only ones to have it published.
Ranuta said that even if he died, he would have lived a long time through his works and through this book.
Under the banner of Sankara Subramanian, S.K. Ramanujan, India's leading comedy film composer, was not a talking figure.
He traveled the world, teaching humorous films.
He was an innovator in the creation of comic books.
Ranuta was an expert not only in painting but also in cartooning and animation.
For the past 30 years, he has cited the study of comic art, adapted to the Indian context.
He said he would live a long life through the students he had created, his writing, his comics.
R. Bhupathi, the coordinator of the Ranuta Cartoon Research and Education Foundation, thanked him.
Many others attended the concert, including GoodTammy, TV executive C. Pereira, and others.
The Democrats have asked Chief Minister Edapati Pranaissami how many barriers have been built under the last eight years of the Aam Aadmi Party rule.
In a statement, the party's treasurer Durai Murugan, criticized the Chief Minister for being uninformed about the public works sector.
Democratic finance minister Durai Murugan said in his statement that the water released at Kaveri is wasted in the sea due to the government's negligence - lack of administrative skills.
Our leader, MK Stalin, had expressed his concern about his responsibilities as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, saying that the A.T.M.C. government had no tangible plan to stop Kaveri from passing through.
Thinking that the answer to the Chief Minister would answer that, the speaking Etapadi Palinicharami has asked, "Did the DmuK, who accuse us, build at least a barrier in Kaveri under their rule?"
"What I would like to inform him is that we have built a barrier to the union government in Kaveri in Maynoor, Dhaka.
Without even knowing that detail, can Chief Minister Etapadi Palanichaami, who has also put the Public Works Department in charge, speak out against the truth?
The dam built at Maynour caused the surface of the earth to rise in that area.
As a result, agriculture flourished.
So we can see that thousands of people of the farming tribe in that region, which is still productive today, are always grateful to the federal government.
At that time, the dam was built by the Union government in Maynour in response to the demand.
At that time, there was no need to build more dams.
If necessary, the artist who was then the Chief Minister would have given immediate permission, set aside funds, and accelerated the work.
Therefore, it is not even close to Etapadi to blame the club government for maintaining Kaveri's well-being.
But I ask; how many dams have you built in Kaveri in the last eight years of the A.T.M.C. rule?
Another question is; during the Duma rule, we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu.
Can you point to at least one commissioner as a dam built under the recent A.T.M.C. regimes?
Don't lie to me.
If the opposition leader has any answer to their accusation - we are still building or planning to build a fence - please let the sources know.
I am obliged to point out that, instead of saying that the Kaveri block was not built under the DMK regime, the personal ladder can be beautiful if it is necessary, the post of Chief Minister he holds, it is neither a civilized act nor beauty".
The State Bank of India has decided to set interest rates on a repo basis from 1st October.

The deadline for Aadhaar connection with PAN number has been extended until December 31.
The deadline for linking the Aadhaar number to the permanent income tax account number (PAN) has been extended until December 31.
This is the seventh time that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDD) has extended the deadline for the pan-Aadhaar connection.

The lower part of the valley is a prosperous area from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.
The study focuses on the urbanization of the Vaibhai River basin based on the evidence currently available.
Scientific estimates at the bottom of the excavation have concluded that the Tamil-Brahmi period is still more than 100 years old.The study shows that Tamil was a literate society as early as the 6th century BC.
Moreover, samples of 70 skeletons discovered by the study have been sent to the postgraduate and research institute, Deacon College, for scientific analysis.
In the analysis of these arthropods, the species of the species was classified by nature and was identified by arthropods, including the tiger, deer, goat, wild boar, manatee, and hare.
Since cattle, goats, and goats contribute to agriculture in a manner that is consistent with the animal's diet, and cuts are found in some animal scales, such as cattle, goats, and wild boar, these animals are also used for food in this study.
By concluding this analysis, the people of the Sangakkala society who were primarily agricultural also carried on livestock raising.
Samples of brick-cut tile-based roof tiles and earthenware-based tiles have been sent to the Valor Technical University for analysis.
In each of these, minerals such as silicon, lead, iron, aluminum, and magnesium are found in this study.

Is the BJP supporting the racial politics that has established itself in Tamil Nadu?
It is said that in Tamil Nadu somehow, if somewhere the copper cannot be cleaned and bloomed, the BJP will eventually take over the caste politics.
When Modi was Prime Minister for the first time, Tamil Nadu was in a situation where it was necessary to leave the tamara and see the dust.
For the second time since then, that is, during the last parliamentary election, Amitabh Shah has said with a firm voice, "I don't know what you are doing.
However, only the soil was able to cram in all five constituencies in which it competed.
While the entire country is beating BJP, the opposition is still rolling in Tamil Nadu.
And above all, it is the issue of the three-triangle, Kashmir issue, Hindi language, one nation, one language.
Since all this is combined, it is still seen in the sex scene.
That is why the BJP leadership is so fierce against the BJP executives in Tamil Nadu, and is said to be the reason why it is still too difficult to appoint even the state head.
Although this is a one-sided project, the BJP is planning to somehow root out the BJP in Tamil Nadu by the upcoming assembly elections.
For that, it seems that the BJP leadership has come to a near-conclusion through live field reporting, intelligence reporting and the like.
Accordingly, the opinion that the two Dravida parties, whether Aam Aadmi Party or DMK, do not give enough importance to the Nadar people, the Vaniyar people and the Devendra Kula people, is pervasive among the people of the respective society.
He is reportedly also regretting the Dravidian parties.
And this is the very subtle scheme that the BJP has begun to implement by tactfully taking into account.
Or have decided to honor a position in a society that honors or promotes the race.
The appointment of Tamilidysha Saundrajan as the Governor of Telangana is one such thing.
Similarly, the BJP government is also said to be attaching importance to high-ranking officials at ISROTA.
It is true that if BJP acts in this way to honor each race, it will bring pride and joy to the people of that race.
Moreover, something that is not uncommon in any way, the Caste will be uncommon in this politics for the BJP.
At the same time, while Tamil Nadu is already becoming a hallmark of caste politics, it is not clear whether these BJP activities will become like pouring more oil on a burning fire.
If the caste fire is burned and burned, the fact is that even the cotton buds that are now a little flourishing in Tamil Nadu will be burned and bloomed in the same fire!

The Indian government is making a serious effort to make it a country free from plastic and non-use.

Listen to everyone, Yata Yadum.... Modi spoke in Tamil at the UN General Assembly about the wonderful concept of the world.
