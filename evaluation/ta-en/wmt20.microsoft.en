The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period of Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh from six years to one year and one month.
This has removed the impasse in contesting the Tamang by-election.
The Sikkim Assembly elections were held along with the Lok Sabha elections.
The Sikkim Krantikari Morcha won the election with a thumping majority.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
But it is not a compliment that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new dimension and a clear ideology to the revolutionary movements and thereby to Indian politics.
Even today we can see that there is a perception among the people that the revolutionaries are mere idiots and have no concern for human life.
The era of Bhagat Singh reminds us of his humanity, clarity of thought and capability.
It was only after the Assembly bombing in April 1929 that Bhagat Singh's name became widespread in India.
In Tamil Nadu, he was introduced to the public only in 1930.
But within a year of his debut, his fame spread rapidly to every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most astonishing news in history. The name of any leader born in the North, including Mr. Gandhi, has spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.
The reason for this is Thanthai Periyar.
A week after Bhagat Singh's assassination, an editorial appeared in the Republic Weekly under the headline Bhagat Singh.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh's qualities and made some observations on the political situation of the day.
Excerpts from the editorial:-
"Indeed, if Bhagat Singh had been convinced that his entire principles were right and the way he behaved was the right way to implement them, then we would have said that he must have behaved as he did, and if he had not done so, he would not have been a decent man.
So now we will also call him a real man.
It is our strong opinion that what India really needs is Bhagat Singh's ideology.
Thiru. If Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and died, there would have been no evidence that this victory could have been achieved by so much popularity.
If Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhism would have been more productive.
Bhagat Singh, who should have died of illness on his own, had to die a useful mother to show the way to true equality and peace for the people of India and the world.
We congratulate Bhagat Singh wholeheartedly, with open mouths and hands saying that it is a great fortune that no one else can attain by ordinary means!"
Thanthai Periyar has mentioned in the editorial of Republic magazine.

"I was shocked when I was told that he had been arrested for it, which is difficult for any 6-year-old to understand and explain," he said.

The DMK has asked Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami how many check dams were built during the AIADMK rule in the last eight years.
In a statement, party treasurer Duraimurugan criticised the Chief Minister for blurting out any information about the Public Works Department.
DMK treasurer Durai Murugan said in his statement that the water released into Cauvery will not be released to A.T. M. It goes wastefully into the sea due to the apathy of the government and lack of administrative efficiency.
On the way to the Cauvery crossing, the A.D. M. Our leader M. Karunanidhi said that the government has no concrete plan. K. Stalin had expressed his concern in his capacity as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.
Thinking that he was replying to the Chief Minister, Edappadi Palaniswami said, "T who blames us. M. Did you build a check dam on Cauvery during your rule?"
"I want to inform him, The. M. During the Kazhagam regime, we had built a check dam at Mayanur on the Cauvery river.
Without even knowing that information, Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who is also in charge of the Public Works Department, can speak untruthfully?
The check dam built at Mayanur increased the water resources of the earth in that area.
So agriculture prospered.
Thousands of farmers in the area, who are still benefiting from it, can be seen thanking the Kazhagam government forever.
A check dam was constructed by the Kazhagam government at Mayanur as per the need of the time.
At that time, there was no need to build more check dams.
If there was a need, the then Chief Minister Kalaignar would have immediately sanctioned it, allocated funds and accelerated the work
Therefore, Edappadi has no right to blame the Kazhagam government for the welfare of Cauvery.
I'm listening; a. The. M. How many check dams have you built on the Cauvery in the last eight years?
One more question; "We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during DMK rule.
So far, the A.D. M. Can you cite even one dam built during the regime?
Don't lie.
If you have any answer to the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition, please tell us with evidence that we are building or planning to construct check dams at such and such places.
Aside from that, the. M. I am obliged to point out that it may be beautiful for an individual Edappadi to say that no check dam has been built on the Cauvery during the DMK regime, but it is neither fashionable nor beautiful for the Chief Minister's post he holds," Duraimurugan said.

Is BJP resorting to caste politics to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu?
It is said that if the lotus cannot bloom somewhere in Tamil Nadu, the BJP will finally take up caste politics.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, Tamil Nadu had to look at the lotus.
After this, for the second time, during the Lok Sabha elections, he said, "I don't know what you will do. Lotus should blossom in Tamil Nadu," Amit Shah said.
However, in all the five constituencies contested, it could only be swept away.
Though the BJP is being praised all over the country, there is a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.
Above all, triple talaq, Kashmir issue, Hindi imposition, one nation, one language.
All this adds up and it is still in a state of flux.
That is why it is said that the BJP leadership is very angry with the Tamil Nadu BJP office-bearers and due to this there is a problem that even the state leadership cannot be appointed.
Despite this, the BJP is planning to somehow take root in Tamil Nadu before the upcoming assembly elections.
For this, the BJP leadership seems to have come to a conclusion through direct field reports and intelligence reports.
Accordingly, there is a feeling among the people of the respective communities that whether it is AIADMK or DMK, the two Dravidian parties do not give enough importance to the Nadar community, the Vanniyar community and the Devendrakula Vellalar people.
It is said that the Dravidian parties are upset with this.
It is this trick that the BJP has started to implement.
It has decided to honour the community with a position that gives pride or importance to the community.
The appointment of Tamilisai Soundararajan as the Governor of Telangana is one such case.
Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is giving importance to the Nadars who hold high positions in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP works in such a way that every community is honoured, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of that community.
Moreover, what is not lost in any case will be lost to the BJP in this caste politics.
At the same time, it is not known whether these actions of the BJP will add fuel to the fire when Tamil Nadu is already torn apart by caste politics.
If that happens, if the fire of caste starts burning, even the bud of the lotus that is now blooming in Tamilnadu will be burnt in the same fire!
