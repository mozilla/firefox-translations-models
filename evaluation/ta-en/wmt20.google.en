Gulalai Ismail is from Pakistan.
A social activist, she has been speaking out against child marriage, violence against women, lynchings, and oppression since childhood.
He posted photos on social media, along with evidence, of the sexual harassment being committed by the Pakistani military against Pashtun women and girls, a tribal ethnic group, in some areas, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces.
As a result, a &quot;treason case&quot; has been registered against Gulalai, and the country&#39;s police are actively involved in trying to arrest him.
However, Gulalai Ismail fled Pakistan with the help of friends and relatives and sought refuge in the United States.

President Maithripala Sirisena said that the system in the country where university graduates protest on the streets demanding jobs is due to an education system that has distanced itself from the fields of science, technology and research.
Therefore, the President stated that it is very important to make the necessary fundamental changes in national education policies and introduce and implement new education systems from developed countries in the country.
The President made this statement while addressing the inauguration of the second phase of the &#39;Shilpa Sena&#39; exhibition which began at the National Stadium in Polonnaruwa, Kallella yesterday (25) morning.

The President also explained the need for experts in the field to pay close attention to this issue in this era when collaboration between science, technology and research sectors is increasingly needed to overcome the challenges faced by our countrymen due to climate change.
The President stated that the fact that most people in the political, scientific, technological and research sectors think only about themselves and not about the country is a major challenge in the country&#39;s journey towards development. He also noted that the country is losing the educated people it needs in the fields of engineering, medicine and accounting because those who receive free education think only about themselves and not about the country and leave the country is a major problem.
The Shilpa Sena exhibition, held under the theme &#39;A Prosperous Nation through Strong Hands&#39;, is divided into five sections, mainly focusing on entrepreneurship in the technology sector, job fair, new products, blue-green sector and entertainment.
The Technology Sector is organized to promote modern science, technology and research knowledge in the key themes of STEM education, aerospace technology, biotechnology, robotics, nanotechnology, mechatronics, new energy, blue-green technology, and 55G IOT.

The President, who opened the exhibition, inspected it and had a cordial discussion with the staff.
Secretary to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research, Chinthaka S. Lokuhettike and many other officials participated in the event.

A demonstration was held on behalf of the Secular Progressive Alliance, condemning the Hindu Front&#39;s violent course in connection with the attack on 28 knitwear factories and urging the police to take swift action.
On the 5th, more than 60 members of an organization called Hindu Munnani trespassed and attacked a knitwear factory on Angeripalayam Road in Tiruppur.
As a result, the workers there were attacked and company property was damaged.
The police have made few comments on this matter.
The incident has drawn strong condemnation from industry members, various political parties, movements and the general public, and the Tiruppur Secular Progressive Alliance parties have announced a protest on the 9th to condemn the incident.
After permission was denied, a complaint was filed with the District Collector and the Tiruppur Municipal Police Commissioner.
At a subsequent consultative meeting, the Secular Progressive Alliance announced another protest on September 17th.
Since the police department refused permission for this protest as well, a protest march was held in front of the Tiruppur Corporation at 11 am on the 17th, defying the ban, &quot;condemning the violent trend of the Hindu Front and urging the police to take immediate action.&quot;
The protest was led by Tiruppur North District DMK Secretary K. Selvaraj.
CPI(M) state committee member K. Kamaraj, Tiruppur district CPI(M) secretary S. Muthukkannan, Tiruppur district CPI secretary M. Ravi, Ramasamy and MDMK Sampath from the Congress party and other party executives participated in the protest.
In the middle of the demonstration, the police intervened, saying that the demonstration was not permitted.
At that time, the Secular Progressive Alliance party stated that; On the 5th, an organization called Hindu Munnani attacked a knitwear factory in Tiruppur and caused a riot.
We formally requested permission to hold a democratic protest to condemn this incident, but the police did not grant permission. We filed a complaint with the governor and the police commissioner regarding this matter. However, the police still refused permission for the protest. Considering the importance of the demand, the protest is currently being held in a democratic manner, violating the ban.
Furthermore, the police have arrested only a few people in the incident where the knitwear company was attacked.
They also said that the police should take prompt action to arrest the Hindu Munnani rowdies involved in this incident.
The protest was attended by a large crowd of over 500 people, especially women, who raised their voices against violence, prompting the police to retreat without arresting those who had broken the ban.
The protest saw slogans raised strongly condemning the attack on a knitwear factory in Tiruppur by the Hindu Front and the various forms of religious violence being perpetrated by the Hindu Front.
It is no exaggeration to say that the democratically controlled sit-in by the Secular Progressive Alliance created awareness against violence among the people of Tiruppur!

&quot;If I do it, people will come forward to do it too!&quot; Ramsingh, speaking about this initiative, said, &quot;I could see the frustration among the people due to various activities such as the difficulties of buying vegetables in large quantities, traffic jams, and environmental pollution.
While many people have complained about this, they don&#39;t seem to be thinking about an alternative or realizing that the solution lies within them.
The right solution to this is that if I do what I believe in, people will follow suit.
So my wife and I walk 10 km once a week to buy vegetables.
It&#39;s been going on for six months, so it&#39;s become a habit now.
&quot;I am very satisfied mentally now,&quot; he said.
&quot;Many people said it was difficult to walk carrying so many vegetables. I suggested they carry bamboo baskets to combat the plastic menace.&quot;
But they laughed at that.
So, my wife and I carried the bamboo basket and went to the market.
That&#39;s when I realized for myself that it would be very helpful in many ways.
Many young people these days are not in good health.
I think they need to start walking and control their diet.
I am a deep believer that traditional methods can provide the best solutions to the new challenges that arise in a modernized world.
&quot;If one follows traditional methods, one can be completely healthy,&quot; says Ram Singh I. A. S. enthusiastically.

Heart diseases, including heart attacks, are among the leading causes of death worldwide.
Heart diseases are on the rise in India.
Young people also suffer from heart attacks.
If we are aware and keep our bodies safe, we can prevent 80 percent of heart diseases.
If our mother, father, grandparents, or grandparents have heart disease, we are also more likely to develop heart disease.
If we lead a healthy lifestyle, we can prevent heart disease to some extent.
With current modern medicine, it is possible to predict in advance who will have a heart attack.
If detected early, a heart attack can be prevented.
Even if you do have a heart attack, you can recover quickly.
He said this.
The Election Commission has reduced the disqualification period of Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh, who was convicted in a corruption case, from 6 years to one year and one month.
This has cleared the roadblock to Tamang contesting the by-election.
The Sikkim Assembly elections were held along with the Lok Sabha elections.
The Sikkim Kranthikari Morcha won a landslide victory in this election.
The party&#39;s leader, Prem Singh Tamang, took over as the state&#39;s Chief Minister.
But in 2016, a lower court sentenced Tamang to prison in a corruption case.
This was confirmed by the Supreme Court, and he had to serve time in prison.
Controversy erupted as Tamang was about to take office, as a person who has served a prison sentence in a corruption case cannot contest elections for 6 years.
Meanwhile, Tamang is contesting the assembly by-election in Sikkim.
Tamang is ruling Sikkim with the support of the BJP.
Meanwhile, Tamang had sent a letter to the Election Commission, citing various sections of the law, seeking the lifting of the six-year ban imposed on him from contesting elections.
The Election Commission, after reviewing the letter, announced that it would reduce Tamang&#39;s ban period to one year and one month.
This means that Tamang is not barred from contesting the assembly by-election.
The BJP can now start playing its politics in other states, including Tamil Nadu, using the concession given to Tamang.
Reports may also be released showing the Election Commission fully implementing the BJP&#39;s wishes.
Government doctor Venkatesan, father of student Udith Surya, has been suspended in the NEET exam impersonation case.
Additionally, a man named Joseph, who acted as a middleman in the human trafficking case, has been arrested in Kerala.
Udit Surya, a student enrolled in Theni Government Medical College, was found to have impersonated in the NEET exam.
The police subsequently registered a case against Udit Surya and his family.
But Udit Surya and his family fled and went into hiding.
Udit Surya had also filed a petition in the court seeking anticipatory bail.
In this situation, the Tamil Nadu police arrested Udit Surya, who was hiding with his family in Tirupati.
Udit Surya&#39;s family was arrested in a cage and brought to Theni, where they were interrogated for several hours.
During this investigation, Udit Surya&#39;s father, Dr. Venkatesan, admitted that he impersonated his son to make him a doctor.
After Venkatesan confessed to the police, everyone was produced in court and remanded in custody.
Udit Surya&#39;s father worked as a government doctor at Stanley Hospital in Chennai.
The Tamil Nadu government has suspended Venkatesan as he is currently arrested and imprisoned.
Furthermore, based on the confession given by Venkatesan, a middleman named Joseph has been arrested in Kerala.
He is to be brought to Tamil Nadu for questioning.
Chennai Stanley Government Hospital Doctor Venkatesan, father of student Udith Surya, has been suspended in the NEET exam impersonation case.
Meanwhile, the CBCID police conducted an investigation today at the NEET exam coaching center run by middleman Joseph in Thiruvananthapuram.
It is alleged that Joseph was committing large-scale impersonation fraud under the guise of a NEET coaching center.
That&#39;s why Udit Surya&#39;s father, Dr. Venkatesan, has easily approached Joseph.
The CBCID police are also examining documents at Joseph&#39;s training center.

There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
However, it is not just praise that Bhagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to revolutionary movements and thereby to Indian politics.
We can still see a perception among the people today that revolutionaries are just fools, cold-hearted people who don&#39;t care about human lives.
Bhagat Singh&#39;s time reminds us of his humanity, clear thinking, and ability.
It was only after the Assembly bombing in April 1929 that Bhagat Singh&#39;s name became widespread in India.
In Tamil Nadu, he was introduced to the public a little later, in 1930.
But within a year of his debut, his fame had spread rapidly to every nook and cranny of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most amazing news in history. The name of no leader born in the North, including Gandhi, has ever spread to Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
The reason for that is Father Periyar.
The week after Bhagat Singh was killed, an editorial titled &quot;Bhagat Singh&quot; was published in the weekly magazine &quot;Rashtriya&quot;.
The editorial praised many of Bhagat Singh&#39;s qualities and also made some comments on the political situation of the day.
Some excerpts from that editorial:-
&quot;If Bhagat Singh truly believed that all his principles were correct and decided that the examples he followed were the right path to implement them, then we would say that he should have acted as he did, and we would say that if he had not acted in that way, he could not have been called a virtuous man.&quot;
So now we will call him a real man.
It is our strong opinion that what India really needs is the Bhagat Singh ideology.
If Mr. Bhagat Singh had not been hanged and sacrificed his life, there would have been no basis for this victory to be achieved through such popularity.
Moreover, we can say that if Bhagat Singh had not been hanged, Gandhianism would still have flourished.
Bhagat Singh, who should have been reduced to ashes by illness, had to sacrifice his life to show the people of India and the world the path to true equality and peace.
&quot;We praise Bhagat Singh with all our hearts, mouths, and hands, saying that he is a great man who no one else can achieve through ordinary means!&quot;
Father Periyar mentioned this in an editorial in the Republic magazine.
In this case, Dennis Turner, a police officer who was on duty at the school where the incident took place, arrested the girl who was being disruptive at the school for kicking and punching the teacher.

His fingerprints have also been taken.
The girl&#39;s family was later informed and she was handed over to her family.
It is not known whether he took another child to the police station.
Kirkland, the grandmother of the little girl, who agreed to reveal the identity of Kaya Roll, told the media in an interview, &quot;My granddaughter suffers from a sleeping disorder called &#39;Sleep Apnea&#39;, and as a result of the medication she takes for it, she sometimes acts like this.&quot;
&quot;I was very shocked when I was told that he had been arrested for this,&quot; he said, adding that it would be difficult for any 6-year-old child to understand and explain.

On the 24th, a report on the status of the global nuclear energy industry was released.
The head of the committee that prepared the report was Michael Scheider.
According to the study, the nuclear energy sector, which accounted for 17.46 percent of the world&#39;s energy demand in 1996, has declined to 10.15 percent in 2018.
This decline shows that the world&#39;s attention is shifting away from nuclear power and toward renewable, long-term energy.
Replacing nuclear power, renewable energies such as solar power, wind power, and hydroelectric power are growing globally.
Every year, various organizations jointly publish a report on the status of the global nuclear energy sector.
According to a report released this year, the nuclear energy sector appears to be in decline worldwide.
The report also states that India&#39;s nuclear energy sector is in a very poor state.
Bill Gates honored Indian Prime Minister Modi with the Global Goalkeeper Award for his excellent implementation of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
In India, the central government led by Prime Minister Modi is announcing and implementing the &quot;Clean India&quot; program.
This scheme was launched in 2014, on 2-10-2014, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The project aims to build toilets in homes, establish public toilets, and develop solid waste management.
Under this scheme, more than 10 crore toilets have been built across the country.
Rural health coverage has been brought to 98 percent of villages.
In recognition of this project, it was announced that Modi would be presented with the World Goalkeeper Award, an international achievement award, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation of the United States.
In this context, Prime Minister Modi, who is on a tour of the United States, was presented with the Global Goalkeeper Award today.
The world&#39;s richest man, Bill Gates, presented the award to Modi at a ceremony held today on the sidelines of the UN Security Council meeting in New York.
Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Modi said that Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s dream of cleanliness has now been fulfilled.

The Ministry of Education has issued a media statement regarding the vacation leave of teachers and principals.
A statement issued by the Ministry of Education states that consultations and recommendations have been made to resolve salary discrepancies in the service of teachers and principals.
The Ministry of Education has stated that it is a grave injustice for teachers and principals to not report for work on sick leave based on their salary discrepancies, as the recommendations of the Public Service Salary Dispute Resolution Committee to increase the salaries of all government employees, including teachers and principals, are ready to be implemented from January 1st next year.
It is the right of employees to engage in trade union activities.
The Ministry stated that it was not challenged, however, that it is not appropriate for a smart and honorable profession like teacher principals to be deceived by the opportunistic actions of trade unions, which are used as a strategy to deceive members by pointing to the success achieved due to their actions, even after learning about the possible salary increase.
The salaries of teachers and principals have been increased significantly since 2015, with this amount being increased by 106 percent, and the increase in salaries is a new step taken by any government, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam stated in Parliament last July.
The Minister had stated in Parliament on June 7th that the Ministry of Education had submitted suggestions and recommendations regarding the salary discrepancy of teachers and principals to the Ranukke Committee appointed to investigate the salary discrepancy that generally exists within the public service.
The allowance for principals has been increased from Rs. 650 to Rs. 6,500.
The promotion process, which had been delayed since 2015, has now been properly implemented.
The procedure to be followed for receiving pension has been prepared and implemented.
In order to reclaim the presidential service from politics and address the shortcomings in the presidential standard in that service, a competitive examination was held and approximately 6,000 people were recruited into the service.
Measures such as providing teachers and principals with opportunities for training abroad and recruiting 25,000 people into the teaching service were implemented in a short period of time, i.e., in the last four and a half years.
The Ministry of Education further stated in a media statement issued today that these were carried out with the aim of human resource development in the education sector.

Vikram Lander has hit the lunar surface with a forceful impact. NASA has released photographic evidence.
28 NASA&#39;s LROC orbiter has captured and sent back images of the impact site of Chandrayaan-2&#39;s Vikram lander on the Moon&#39;s south pole.
The Vikram lander of ISRO&#39;s Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft landed on the south pole of the moon on the 7th.
But, at the last moment, communication with it was cut off.
It was thought that the Vikram lander may have been damaged and lost communication because it crashed quickly instead of landing gently on the lunar surface.
In this case, NASA&#39;s LROC orbiter passed over the south pole of the moon on the 17th.
At that time, the Vikram lander landed on the plain between the two ridges, Simpelius N and Mancinus C, and sent a highly sophisticated image.
An analysis of these images has confirmed that the Vikram lander hit the ground with a forceful impact.
That&#39;s why it fell a short distance from where it was supposed to land.
&quot;The LROC orbiter passed over the south pole of the moon on the 17th,&quot; said John Keller, NASA&#39;s AROC deputy program director.
At that time, it sent pictures taken in the evening darkness.
An investigation revealed that the Vikram lander had hit the ground hard and landed.
However, the exact location of the Vikram lander&#39;s landing could not be determined.
LROC R Bitter will pass over the South Pole again on the 14th of next month.
&quot;Since the light will be good then, there are more chances of capturing the Vikram lander,&quot; he said.

If you reject the government&#39;s anti-democratic stance, you can be labeled an anti-national and arrested.
A legal amendment has been brought for this.
He alleged that human rights violations are taking place, such that if someone criticizes the BJP or posts on social media, they are labeled as terrorists and sent to prison, adding that the country is currently facing an economic crisis.
Because people don&#39;t have the purchasing power.
But the government has poured 2 lakh crore rupees into the hands of rich capitalists.
He urged everyone to participate in the protest to be held from October 10th to 16th against this anti-people government.
He continued, saying that the Prime Minister is campaigning for Trump without caring about the nation or the economy.
When an actor from Bangladesh came to India to campaign, the Indian government prevented him.

We see it as an act against the entire world and humanity.
Therefore, the entire world must unite against terrorism.

&quot;The only message we give to the world is &#39;harmony and peace&#39;.&quot;
Modi mentioned this in his speech.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa is contesting this election as the candidate of Mahinda Rajapaksa&#39;s Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna.
Parties including the JVP have also announced candidates.
Confusion persisted over who Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe&#39;s United National Party candidate would be.

Similarly, reports emerged that President Maithripala Sirisena was also making efforts to contest as a common candidate.
He believes that if Ranil contests, he will be able to win Tamil votes.
Sirisena&#39;s calculation is that he can easily win if Ranil is sent to prison instead of contesting.
But both of these have not been fulfilled.
Sajitha Premadasa is currently being proposed as the candidate of the United National Party.
It is also noteworthy that Sajitha is the son of former President Premadasa.
Sajith has rallied his supporters, demonstrated his strength, and emerged as a presidential candidate.

Many kings, including the Chera, Chola, Pandyas, Chalukyas, and Krishna Deva Raya, did not encourage women to study during the Aadsik period.
But it was Periyar who fought for women to be educated, their livelihoods to improve, and equal rights to property.
The one who implemented it was scholar Anna.
That way, under DMK leader Kalaignar&#39;s rule, there was reservation for women, equal rights in property, equal education, and merit-based education.
Father Periyar was the one who caused all this.
Father Periyar&#39;s policies are now in danger.
He said that while many doctors are being produced on the basis of merit through balanced education, today we have been deceived in the name of NEET examination.

The United States has urged India to take urgent steps to ease restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir and release all those in detention.
Speaking at the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells said:
The large number of people being detained in the Jammu and Kashmir Valley is worrying.
The Indian government should initiate political activities in the state.
Elections should be held quickly, as previously promised.
Restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir should be eased and those in detention should be released.
Alice Wells emphasized that the Indian government should take steps to address this issue quickly.
Earlier, there was a report that US President Donald Trump wanted to mediate in the Jammu and Kashmir issue.
This was strongly opposed by India.
The United States later withdrew its opinion.
Following this, Prime Minister Modi went to the United States to participate in the UN General Assembly meeting.
Modi and Donald Trump first participated in the Howdy Modi event in Houston.
Later, the two participated in various events together.
At that time, Trump had praised Prime Minister Modi as the father of India.
In this situation, the United States is currently putting pressure on India on the Kashmir issue.
The IIT Council meeting has decided to increase fees by 10 times in all technical educational institutions in India.
IITs, also known as Institutes of Technical Education, play a key role in developing talented students across India.
The IIT Council, comprising the directors of 23 IIT educational institutions operating under the Ministry of Human Resource Development of the Central Government, met on 28.9.2019 under the chairmanship of Union Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal.
The decision taken at that meeting has shocked students and the public.
A decision has been taken to increase the fees for M. Tech. courses by 10 times in IT institutes.
All IITs in India charge tuition fees ranging from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 50,000 per semester.
In this situation, the fee has now been increased to 2 lakh rupees per year.
Of the 12,280 students studying in the first year of 2019-2020, 9,280 are eligible for the scholarship. It has also been decided to discontinue the monthly scholarship of Rs. 12,400 provided to M. Tech. students.
The central government will reduce the funding provided to IT institutes in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kharagpur, Kanpur, Roorkee, and Guwahati.
To cope with this reduction in funding, the central government has increased fees to collect that money from students.
Furthermore, it is said that the respective technical educational institutions have been instructed to carry out development works using the funds generated from the construction work they can do, and the ministry has also instructed them to take loans from banks and obtain funds from corporate companies.
Since coming to power, the BJP has been trying to prevent the common man from accessing education as much as possible. It reduced funding for primary education in the 2015 budget and has continued to drastically reduce funding for education in every subsequent budget.
Following this, big businessmen continued to grant permission to open educational institutions in order to provide more facilities to private educational institutions.
In this situation, the new education policy has imposed various regulations requiring educational institutions to operate with the funds of private companies, without giving any importance to government educational institutions.
By doing this, the central government is pushing India&#39;s prosperous future back several centuries into an illiterate country, pushing only the wealthy to pursue higher education.
Former IAS officer Karpoora Sundarapandian received the book &quot;Kelipatak Kalai&quot; written by Ranu, which was published by Kalaimagal magazine editor Keelampur Sankara Subramaniam.
The book &quot;The Art of Cartooning&quot;, written by the late &quot;cartoonist&quot; Ranu alias S. K. Ramanujam, was released at the Russian Cultural Center in Chennai on Sunday.
The ceremony was presided over by P. Thangappan, Secretary of the Indo-Russian Chamber of Commerce.
At the event, former IAS officer and head of the Siddha Research Center, R. Karpoora Sundara Pandian, received the award for the release of the first book by Kalaimagal magazine editor Keelampur Sankara Subramaniam.
Speaking at the event, Karpoora Sundarapandian, who attended as a special guest, said:-
The late cartoonist Ramanujam, also known as Ranu, was one of the greatest caricaturists.
Ranu has produced numerous students through the Cartoon Research and Education Foundation.
Generally, even someone who is celebrated by the world is not celebrated by their family.
On the contrary, it is a matter of pride that the family of cartoonist Ranu, even after her death, has brought out the book she wrote.
He said that even though Ranu has passed away, she will live on for a long time through her works and this book.
While Keelampur Sankara Subramaniam was speaking, S. K. Ramanujam was India&#39;s leading cartoonist.
He traveled all over the world, giving comedy lessons.
He was an innovative artist in the creation of cartoons.
Ranu was not only an artist, but also an expert in the field of cartooning and animation.
For the past 30 years, he has been researching the art of caricature, adapted to the Indian context.
He said that he will live long through the students he created, his writings, and his caricatures.
R. Bhupathi, Coordinator of the Ranu Cartoon Research and Education Foundation, delivered the vote of thanks.
Nallathambi, television executive C. Pereira, and many others participated.
The DMK has questioned Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami about how many check dams have been built during the last 8 years of AIADMK rule.
In a statement issued in this regard, the party&#39;s treasurer, Duraimurugan, criticized the Chief Minister for being ignorant of any details about the Public Works Department.
DMK Treasurer Duraimurugan has said in his statement that the water released into the Cauvery is being wasted in the sea due to the AIADMK government&#39;s lack of interest and lack of administrative capacity.
Our leader M. K. Stalin, in his responsibility as the Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, had expressed his concern that the A. D. M. K. K. government had no concrete plan to stop and store the Cauvery as it passes through.
Speaking in response to the Chief Minister, Edappadi Palaniswami asked, &quot;Did the DMK members who are criticizing us build even one dam on the Cauvery during their rule?&quot;
&quot;What I want to tell him is that during the DMK rule, we built a check dam on the Cauvery at a place called Mayanur during the Congress rule.&quot;
Without even knowing that detail, can Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who has also put the Public Works Department in his charge, speak untruthfully?
The dam built in Mayanur increased the earth&#39;s water resources in that area.
So agriculture flourished.
Therefore, thousands of the agricultural community in that region, who still benefit today, can be seen expressing gratitude to the coalition government every day.
A check dam was built by the Congress government in Mayanur as per the needs of the time.
At that time, there was no need to build more dams.
If there had been a need, the then Chief Minister, Kalaignar, would have immediately given permission, allocated funds, and expedited the work.
Therefore, Edappadi has no right to criticize the Congress government for protecting the Cauvery.
I ask; How many check dams have you built on the Cauvery in the last eight years of the AIADMK government?
Another question; We have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the DMK regime.
Can you point out at least one dam built during the AIADMK regimes so far?
Don&#39;t lie.
If you have any answer to the accusation made by the Leader of the Opposition - please provide evidence as to where we are building or planning to build check dams.
&quot;Instead, I am obliged to point out that speaking untruthfully that no dam was built on the Cauvery during the DMK regime may be beautiful for a personal reason, but for the position of Chief Minister he holds, it is neither civilized nor beautiful,&quot; said Durai Murugan.
The State Bank of India has decided to base interest rates on repo rates from October 1.

Deadline for linking Aadhaar with PAN number extended till Dec. 31.
The deadline for linking Aadhaar number with Permanent Income Tax Account Number (PAN number) has been extended till December 31st.
This is the seventh time that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for PAN-Aadhaar linking.
The central government had already extended this period for 6 months from March 31st to September 30th.
This period has now been extended for another 3 months.
The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) issues a 12-digit identification number called Aadhaar number to every Indian citizen.
The Income Tax Department issues a 10-digit numerical and letter identification number called the Permanent Income Tax Account Number (PAN) to individuals and companies who pay income tax.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes had issued a notification on July 1, 2017, requiring linking of Aadhaar number with Income Tax Number.
Since then, the deadline for Aadhaar-PAN linking has been extended several times.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, which heard a case against issuing Aadhaar cards to citizens, ruled in September last year that the Aadhaar scheme was legal.
The Supreme Court also ruled that Aadhaar number is mandatory for paying income tax.
Meanwhile, it was announced in the Union Budget on July 5 that it will be sufficient to mention the Aadhaar number instead of the PAN number when filing income tax returns.
DMK leader M. K. Stalin today personally visited the Keezhadi excavation sites, which showcase the Tamil culture of the Vaigai River.
The results of the Keezhadi excavations revealed that the way of life described in Sangam literature was the life of the Tamils, who lived in flesh and blood; it was not fiction.
Urban civilization began in the 6th century BCE on the banks of the Ganges River to the north.
But the Keezhadi excavation evidence has scientifically proven that Tamils lived a highly developed urban life in the 6th century BC on the banks of the Vaigai River to the south; Tamils were literate and lived a very prosperous life.
The results of the Keezhadi excavations have created a situation where the history of the Indian subcontinent is being rewritten.
The Keezhadi excavation site, which brings pride to every Tamilian, is visited by large numbers of public.
Recently, Seeman, the chief coordinator of the Naam Tamil Party, visited the Keezhadi excavation site.
Following him today, DMK leader M. K. Stalin visited Keezhadi and inspected the excavation sites.
He was accompanied by CPM MP Su. Venkatesan and a number of leading DMK executives.
In this regard, Stalin uploaded a video of his visit on his Twitter page titled &quot;When I visited Keezhadi, the land that made the world aware of Tamil civilization dating back 2600 years.&quot;
Trump demands investigation from Ukrainian president!
The White House has confirmed that reports that Donald Trump asked the president of Ukraine in a phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party&#39;s likely presidential nominee, are true.
The Democratic Party has proposed an impeachment resolution against Trump in the House of Representatives, saying that it was wrong to pressure a foreign country to investigate the American president.
In this regard, 6 committees have been formed on the orders of House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to investigate the President&#39;s actions.
&quot;In this situation, Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone on July 25th, so investigate,&quot; Trump said at the time.
The White House officially released a statement yesterday detailing what the two presidents discussed.
Therefore, it is accepted that this conversation did indeed take place.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump, speaking to reporters outside the United Nations meeting, said the request was made in a friendly manner.
He said that no pressure was put on the Ukrainian president.
But one thing to note is that the US government suddenly suspended financial aid worth about $400 million to Ukraine.
Then, after some time, the funds were allocated.
The Democrats are tying the knot with this and this comment Trump made to the president.
So this incident has begun to stir up a storm in American politics.
Joe Biden&#39;s son, Hunter, was appointed a member of the board of directors of Ukraine&#39;s Burisma Holdings in April 2014.
It is noteworthy that this company was engaged in natural gas extraction operations in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia.
The investigating officer who investigated the corruption complaint against Burisma Holdings has been dismissed.
The Republican Party is accusing Joe Biden of being involved in this.
But Hunter continues to deny allegations that he used his father for his business interests.
The incident of a government official beating up journalists in the presence of School Education Minister Sengottaiyan has caused a stir.
Minister Sengottaiyan inaugurated the drinking water project at Dukanayakkanpalayam near Gopi in Erode district.
While reporters were taking pictures of him, Muthulingam, the assistant executive engineer of the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, stood in their way, causing them trouble.
As a result, reporters have raised their voices, saying, &quot;Sir, sir, stand back a little.&quot;
Then he shouted in unison, &quot;Who are you asking to push? What a bigot you are!&quot; and beat up the reporters who asked him to push.
Minister Sengottaiyan, who learned that he was intoxicated, ordered him to be immediately removed from the premises.
Subsequently, higher officials chased Muthulingam away, telling him not to be at the ceremony and to leave immediately.
However, more than 15 journalists staged a road blockade demanding departmental action against Assistant Executive Engineer Muthulingam.
Minister Sengottaiyan, who learned about this, contacted the higher officials of the Erode District Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board and asked them how dare they come to a government function after drinking alcohol.
He also requested that Muthulingam be suspended.
Minister Pandiarajan said that historical traces have been found in the 5th phase of excavations that will enhance Keezhadi&#39;s fame worldwide.
Jayakanthan, Minister of Kathir and Village Industries Board G. Baskaran, Minister of Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture K. Pandiarajan visited and told reporters:
The Keezhadi Phase 5 excavation marks a turning point in the study of Sangam history in Tamil Nadu.
Keezhadi was a prosperous area from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.
This study focuses on urbanization along the banks of the Vaigai River based on currently available evidence.
Scientific chronology at the excavations at Keezhadi has determined that the Tamil-Brahmi period is 100 years older. This study reveals that Tamil Nadu was a literate society as early as the 6th century BC.
Furthermore, samples of 70 bone fragments unearthed through this study have been sent to Deccan College, a postgraduate and research institute, for scientific analysis.
These fossils were classified according to their characteristics during analysis, and the following species were identified: buffalo, buffalo, goat, wild boar, reindeer, and peacock.
This study suggests that animals such as cows, buffaloes, and goats support agriculture, and that some of the fossil specimens of animals such as reindeer, wild boar, and wild boar have been found to have fang marks, indicating that these animals are also used for food.
By the end of this analysis, the Sangam society, which was primarily agricultural, also took up animal husbandry.
Samples of bricks, limestone-based roof tiles and clay-based plaster of the well have been sent to the Vellore University of Technology for analysis.
Minerals such as silica, limestone, iron, aluminum, and magnesium are found in each of these studies.
To preserve such rare species, work is underway to establish a museum at a prime location at an estimated cost of Rs. 20 crores so that more Tamil scholars, students, and the general public can visit and benefit from the Keezhadi area.
Furthermore, the 5th phase of excavation work will be extended for two weeks and the work will continue.
Similarly, the state government will jointly carry out the 6th phase of excavation work at four locations next year, in collaboration with the central government, said Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture Minister K. Pandiarajan.
Manamadurai MLA S. Nagarajan, former MP Senthilnathan, Assistant Director of Archaeological Department Jeevanantham, Conservator Aasaithambi, Thiruppuvanam Taluk Officer Raja and many others participated in the event.

&quot;Why hasn&#39;t the court itself arrested those involved in Subhasree&#39;s case yet?&quot; the question was asked.
In this situation, I don&#39;t know why ministers and AIADMK members are protesting against Vijay&#39;s remarks alone. &quot;Is Vijay&#39;s stage speech a sign of entering politics?&quot;
When asked, &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about that.&quot;
&quot;Let go of the man, I have to go quickly,&quot; he said and left.

Bill Gates Foundation award goes to Indian girl who fought against child marriage.
A 17-year-old girl from Rajasthan has been awarded the &quot;Changemaker&quot; award by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for her work against child marriage and child labor.
Payal Jangit (17), a girl from Hinsla village, 100 km from Jaipur, Rajasthan.
He campaigned vigorously against the child marriage and child labor practices prevalent in his village.
He also carried out this campaign in some villages near his village.
As a result, many child marriages were prevented in those areas.
In recognition of this act, Boyle was presented with an award by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
In this situation, the awards ceremony was held on Tuesday night in New York City, USA.
Payal Jangit received the &quot;Changemaker&quot; award from Deputy General Secretary Amina J. Mohammed.
Payal, who received the award, said, &quot;There were many problems in our village.
Especially girls are not sent out to study.
They are married off at a young age.
My family decided to get me married at a young age.
Then, I approached a social worker and tried to calm my father down.
After that, we held many rallies and protests against child marriage and demanding that children be sent to school.
We went to every house and raised awareness about this among everyone.
It is worth noting that parents should provide every child with the opportunity to improve their life.
A two-month amnesty period has been declared in Jordan.
The Foreign Employment Bureau stated that the Jordanian Embassy has announced that the amnesty period, which began on September 22nd, will be in effect until November 29th.
Foreign workers who have traveled to Jordan on a work visa and overstayed without a visa beyond the specified period will be able to return to the country without paying any fines during this amnesty period.
However, the Jordanian embassy has stated that foreigners who have traveled there on a tourist visa and overstayed their visa will be able to leave after paying a fine.
It is noteworthy that a similar amnesty period was announced in Jordan last February for foreigners residing there illegally to leave.
Is the BJP taking up the caste politics that have taken hold in Tamil Nadu?
It is said that if somehow, somehow, and somewhere, the lotus cannot bloom in Tamil Nadu, the BJP will eventually take up caste politics.
When Modi was the first Prime Minister, Tamil Nadu was in a situation where it was necessary to abandon the lotus and look for a way out.
After this, for the second time, that is, during the recently concluded MP elections, Amit Shah sternly stated, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you will do. The lotus should bloom in Tamil Nadu.&quot;
However, they were only able to win in the five constituencies they contested.
Even though the BJP is praised across the country, there is a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.
This is above all triple talaq, the Kashmir issue, Hindi imposition, and one nation, one language.
Because everything comes together like this, it is still visible in the sky.
That is why it is said that the BJP leadership is very strict with the Tamil Nadu BJP executives, and because of this, there has been such a problem that it has not even been possible to appoint a state leadership yet.
Although this is one sided, the BJP is planning to somehow entrench itself in Tamil Nadu by the upcoming assembly elections.
It seems that the BJP leadership has almost reached a conclusion through direct field reports and intelligence reports.
Accordingly, there is a prevailing perception among the people of the respective communities that both Dravidian parties, whether it is the AIADMK or the DMK, do not give sufficient importance to the Nadar ethnic people, the Vanniyar ethnic people, and the Devendra Kula Vellalar people.
It is also said that they are upset with the Dravidian parties for this.
The BJP has cunningly taken up this tactic and started implementing it.
They have decided to honor and give a position to their respective communities in a way that makes them proud or gives them importance.
The appointment of Tamilisai Soundararajan as the Governor of Telangana is one such example.
Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is also giving importance to Nadars in high positions in ISRO.
It is true that if the BJP acts in a way that honors each community, it will bring pride and happiness to the people of the respective communities.
Moreover, something that is not good for anything will only be good for the BJP in this caste politics.
At the same time, it is unclear whether these actions by the BJP will add fuel to the fire, as Tamil Nadu is already being torn apart by caste politics.
The truth is that if the fire of caste starts to flare up and burn, even the bud of the lotus that is now blooming a little in Tamil Nadu will be scorched and consumed by the same fire!

Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not utter a single word regarding the Jammu and Kashmir issue during his speech at the United Nations today.
The 74th session of the United Nations is currently underway.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the gathering on behalf of India today.
During his speech, he called on the world to unite against terrorism.
He also remembered the line sung by the Tamil poet Kaniyan Poonkundranar, &quot;Everywhere in the world, everyone sings.&quot;
Modi proudly stated that India is making a major contribution towards solving the problem of global warming, and that India&#39;s contribution to global warming is minimal, while the solution is more.
The Indian government is taking serious steps to make the country a plastic-free country.
He said that a massive health insurance scheme is being implemented in India.
You all, everywhere, listen. . Modi spoke a wonderful idea to the world in Tamil at the UN.
But nowhere in his speech did he mention anything related to the Jammu and Kashmir issue.
The reason for this is that the central government is firmly of the opinion that Jammu and Kashmir is an internal matter of India.
Political observers say that Modi deliberately refrained from speaking a single word on Jammu and Kashmir, as Pakistan wanted to internationalize the issue.
This has sent a message to the world that Kashmir is India&#39;s internal matter.
