Fake, seller writes own reviews!
Fake MAc.
MAC doesnt even make this palette.
Seller has written positive reviews for her own item under the same two names, one Alexis and one ._...look at all the reviews they write for their own products.
Why does this go on here?
These guys should be stopped
Midsomer Norton attack: Four attempted murder arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers have appealed for anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Keith Green - Relevant for the Ages
Though it has been over 3 decades since Keith left this life, his music still resonates with truth.
This was one of the first albums I purchased of Keith's "back in the day".
What a sweet album of praise as he moves through the Psalms!
Excellent Design and Functionaality
We bought one for road trips and trying to interpret maps without having to strain our eyes.
Really nice design, good tactile feel.
I couldn't figure out where the batteries were, sent Lightwedge Customer Service an email and received a response within 24 hours.
If you need one I'd recommend this one.
PM Modi Tweets Tribute To Jacques Chirac, Calls Him True Global Statesman, Friend Of India
Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of former French president Jacques Chirac, saying India mourns the loss of a true global statesman and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who supported India after it conducted nuclear tests in 1998, died on Thursday at age 86. He served as the president of France from 1995 to 2007.
"My deepest condolences on passing away of Jacques Chirac. India mourns the loss of a true global statesman. A friend of India, he played a decisive role in establishing and building India-France Strategic Partnership," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.
India and France have a strategic partnership, initiated in January 1998 during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India. He again visited the country as president in 2006.
Jacques Chirac was known to have been suffering from ill health for a long time.
Kinked hose with vinyl separating - Returned!
I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this.
I also read the reviews raving about this hose.
Since these hoses are maid from remnants; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get.
My luck wasn't good.
The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately.
Gilmour makes great products
For everything I need for my lawn and garden work I try to find a Gilmour product.
They just can't be beat for the price and/or guarantee.
This hose is typical of a Gilmour item.
It is a strong and supple hose and like most other Gilmour products, comes with a lifetime guarantee.
I have cut hoses with my mower and they still replace them.
Quite a company!
Not worth the $$
This is a very cheaply made product.
I would not pay 1$ for this.
The paper is cheap and flimsy--the book will not even stay open (with fear of ripping the binding) so that I can open up to put on piano stand to play.Don't buy this version.
Groomer in Training
I am currently training to be a Groomer/Pet Stylist and this is the book my company uses in their grooming academy to train all groomers.
It is wonderful.
It is very helpful to know that you can turn to any page in this book and find the breed of dog you are looking for.
There are also general instructions that apply to many breeds (ex: teddy bear heads, etc).
Directions are simple, yet detailed enough for anyone to understand.
A must have for groomers and pet stylists!
Book is not about sewing circles, but about putting circles on a quilt by applique
I was hoping for tips on how to sew circles.
This book is all about attaching circles to the quilt with fusible webbing and using raw edge applique.
Not even any tips on applique.
The good news is that the book is only 35 pages and didn't waste too much of my time.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row
Its banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "attempting to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a wholly accurate representation is the subject of continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Extremely Informative
This is such a brilliant book!
i was given this book as a reference guide while i trained as a professional groomer and found it so helpful and informative!
the instructions are detailed enough that it never leaves you stuck with a million questions but simple enough that anyone can understand it.
this is a must have book
This game is boring.
The quality of the pieces is really nice.But there is little interaction between the players and there isn't any rhyme or reason to the difficulties of the monsters and no way to improve your characters.
So if you are just interested in a luck-fest, this is the game for you.
GGGGGGGGREAT
I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse, I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks
Only foundation I use!
I can not buy this any longer in local stores and this is truly long lasting and does the job.
It doesn't melt in the Florida heat and is sheer enough to be natural but have adequate coverage.
I have been using this for about 5-6 years now.
If you're looking for a tiny printed novelty you'll love this
I've always loved The Prophet and I've read it many times.
I gave away my last copy and was looking for a replacement.
I purchased this copy only to find that it was a tiny novelty version of the book.
If you're looking for something tiny to keep in your purse then this is for you.
If you're looking for a "real book" then this is a joke.
very handy--wish it came in a sleeve
I carry this around in my bag (just in case).
I will have to make a little sleeve for it so that I can cut down on the lint & scratches that it collects, though.
It works very well and is the perfect size--not too big to be gauche, not too small to be ineffective.
taste is awful
When I was incarcerated in a Mexican prison, this was the only drink in the joint.
We had to fix it with goat's milk and heat it over an open flame in the yard.
The taste is awful.
It's not pleasing like the thick, hot Chocolate found in Madrid.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is nearly over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he'll play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers" official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers" six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Beautiful...
Beautiful in every way ,well written , superb photography , and fantastic instructions.... make this book a " must have".......whether you use this book as a coffee table, or as a reference book, it is definatley "Top Shelf"..........
I also gave one as a gift...... the receipient was overwhelmed....
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano that sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
This is the product I had been seeking.
This is the product I had been seeking.
After 3 weeks brown spots are gone.
No more need for heavy cover-creams; regular liquid foundation works for me and my skin is beautifully clear.This is a good product.
With consistent use, it removes blemishes on my face and dark spots on my elbows.
longevity is very bad
At first these are fantastic.
Strong, good charge.
But after about 20-maybe 30 if that recharges, some of my batteries just dead.
Or do not hold charge for more than a night.
It is reall bad.
I bought about 5 or 6 (4 packs) of these, more than half of it are useless.
Anointed!
I love the songs on this album and how Keith once again focuses all on the Good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus.
The songs are timeless, the anointing is fresh even after all the years since they were written.
I think that's a sure sign of anointing is to see the fruit remain.
Missing parts, Cheaply made
My kit arrived with parts missing.
Everything was in disarray, with just a few parts resting in their spots.
After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs, I opted to send it back.
The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap kit.
I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back.
What a disappointment.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house rammed by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Beginners Beware
Here's the deal with this pedal.
It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money.
In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.
Not Very Good!
Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days.
I'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon.
When it did work it worked very well.
Perfect!
I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.
But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!
The "rubberized" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all'd), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!
I was disappointed that you would only allow me to purchase 4 when your inventory showed that you had 14 available.
We have many of the old, old issue.
But the number had depleted.
There were not enough books to allow us to use them regularly.
With the additional supply the books will be used more often.
They arre a good old standby for gospel singing.
Lots of FUN!! Very CHEAP made!!!
We have this same game but it was made in 1967, we just thought the newer version would be more up with the times but we like the old one much better!!
This one the tiles are cardboard and the little stand to put your pieces on is also made of very cheap cardboard!!
We just gave this game a way and kept our old one!
!
Not worth it.
When I bought this combo, it was more expensive than the 3 DVDs bought separately.
Unfortunately, I saw it too late.
My bad.
But where's the logic ?Then my cats didn't like those DVDs.
Well, more like "not interested" than "don't like".
TV off or Cat Sitter is the same.And really those DVDs are cheap.
Always the same videos, the same animals, the same noises.
I mean, what's the point of hearing birds if we are seeing fish ??
?I was more entertained by those DVDs than my cats.
Memories
My mother-in-law bought this video for my daughter when she was young.
I was looking for videos the other day for my three year old granddaughter and came across this.
My granddaughter LOVES this video.
She watches it OVER and OVER and OVER.
It is older, dated and corny, but she loves it!
We even find ourselves singing the songs!
have you changed the rubber formula ????
Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses.
You stand behind your product and provide great customer support..
But I am only giving you 4 stars because this hose and the 100 footer I bought a few months back seem to kink more than my older Flexogens not sure why ?
NOT CLAPTION MUSIC VIDEO! A Learn How To Play Guitar LIKE Clapton
I bought this DVD and I'm returning it.
The description and editorial review are misleading.
This is NOT a Clapton video.
Certainly some clips from Clapton, but generally this is a "how to" video.
Same applies to Clapton The Early Years!
ANNO 2070
I have been unable to play this game.
Unisoft has made it unplayable if you are not a techno whiz.
( I have tried several times to get it up and running.)
I just want to play in my home not on the internet and for some reason it will not load on the computer.
I probably will never buy another UNI-SOFT game or product..
I have found my holy grail of skin cosmetics

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' rogue cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognise rogue cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in lab
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then reinjected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise rogue cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
His last album is focused on Praise
Keith Green / Songs for the Shepherd: His previous albums were more focused on encouragement and correction towards the Church.
This, his last, is focused on Praise.
This one is still not as great as his first album, but it is a strong enough Praise album to earn Five Stars.
Just what I was looking for
This magnifier is just what I was looking for.
It is small and easy to hold.
I wanted something to read small numbers/characters on electronic stuff like computers, electronics, etc.
I also work on the insides of computers and this is great for seeing small things.
I don't want to magnify books or magazines.
The light works well and makes reading small things very easy.
Battery died right away.
I would love to give this a higher review.
It seems like such a great concept and I was so excited to get it for my son.
But the battery died 2 days after we got it and of course it takes a small expensive specialty battery.
Not impressed.
Great Hoses
Good USA company that stands behind their products.
I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you.
I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises.
The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time.
Highly reccomend.
Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.
Still Game star looks set for new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered he's been named as the director of a licensed restaurants company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final one in the show's run, and it appears Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official record listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "thriving restaurant trade."
This is not real MAC. Its fake. Seller selling all fake MACs!
this is fake MAC, i just received mine and super upset to find out it isnt real MAc.
Amazon should have better control over sales of Fake makeup.
MAc isnt cheap, when you see price this low it should have been a red flag.
Dont support sales of Fake makeup.
Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.
The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.
Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
FAIL
JUNK!!
!......This product must be miss labeled.
I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.
The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.
I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.
If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.
It charges fast and is dependable.
Thank goodness they are expensive
Yes - this is one of the most expensive candies around, because it only comes imported.
But my goodness - are these ever good.
The KitKat folks could really clean up if they started selling these in the US.
Once you try them you can't wait for more.
So yummy and delivered quickly and fresh.
Great hymn selection
The hymn selection in this edition is very fine, but the paper quality leaves something to be desired.
For a book in which singers are going to be thumbing through, using the index, turning pages as directed, the paper quality does not look like it will stand up to long term use.
Two different ones broke
The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick, and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.
As a result, it broke on the second day.
Amazon replaced with another, which broke due to same issue, but this time was too late to return.
I bought another, more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner
martha stewart's wedding cakes
I have bought a lot of cake decorating books but if you are looking for a guide to decorating cakes I thouroughly recommend buying a collette peteres or peggy porschen.
Even though this book has a lot of photo's it provides some information not much and honestly for the price I would prefer to buy a wedding cake magazine.
This book was a dissapointment not very helpful or useful really.
Dated but Valuable Reading
It is amazing that this book is nearly 15 years old, and further that Bill Gates was so spot on with the current technology that we see today.
It is a good read to see both the vision of this truly amazing entrepreneur, as well as to get an idea of how to think about technology enabling daily life.
Listen to what Bill gates says about the future of technology in your life - the past would indicate he knows what he's talking about.
Not the original stories
I must agree with the other reviewers that this set is awful as it does no show the episodes in the original clifhanger form as shown on TV.
I will be the first in line to buy underdog when it is produced as it was ORIGINALLY shown with all the shorts like tennessee tuxedo and commander mcbragg and with the cliffhangers.
Come on guys give us the original show as it should be and this set will fly off the shelves.
Until then you can keep this junk.
Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.
Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."
Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.

Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!
I got bit!'
His whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area.
Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Clapton Classics
Very disappointing.
This was advertised to be a "note-for-note" lesson on selected Clapton tunes, and it was not even close.
There was no tab to support the little (and sometime inaccurate) portions of the songs that were listed.
I sent a complaint directly to Hal Leonard, but never received the courtesy of a reply.
Different book. Not the expected original. Parts missing.
I expected the "good night sweet butterflies" book that I had in a largerformat.
Because the book is small, some pages have been cut off, and the text is completely different and much worse than the text of the large book.I am very disappointed with this purchase.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
In the land of the blind...
This piece of literature promises enlightenment but fails to deliver.
Though the transient prophet indeed speaks eloquently and his words inspire deep reflection, they fail to impart true understanding.
The initial discourse on love is riveting but what follows quickly descends into empty rhetorical musings which continue until the bitter end.
The most entertaining aspect of this book is the artful use of language which almost masks the fact that the prophet indeed speaks but says nothing.
Book in Shambles When Received
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BOOK FROM Amazon.com LLC .
I ordered this book earlier in the week with Amazon Prime for a going away gift.
I received the book today.
The party is tomorrow.
Half of the book sleeve seems to have been cut off with an exacto knive, also leaving gashes in the book cover.
The packaging was fine.
I could return it but it wouldn't come back before tomorrow.
Spend extra and use another seller.
Fave!
I bought this in LP form when it was brand new, recorded it onto a cassette so I could play it in my car, listened, and listened, and listened.
I have so missed listening to this (no longer have a turn-table) that I've finally reordered it on CD.
YAY!!
Can't wait to play it, and play it, and play it.
No one, absolutely no one wears his heart for God on his sleeve like Keith Green!
I can't wait to meet him in heaven.
It distorts
This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it.
Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me.
This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use.
Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
These are my favorite candies ever!
After hearing mixed opinions about these Kit Kats, I decided to try them.
They are excellent, and I do not regret purchasing them at all.
They taste like matcha with a bit of a vanilla and milky flavor as well.
They are not too sweet or too plain.
These are the best Kit Kats I've ever had, and I would recommend them to anyone who likes matcha-flavored candies or anyone wanting to try an unusual kind of Kit Kat.
Booooorrrring
Hated this product.Predictable.
Not fun.
It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap.
Often times I thought "this seems like d&d; battle.... Just kidding".
We never played it again after one play through.Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board/card ga,es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension.F
Chocolate Butter Cake
I just multiplied the Chocolate Butter Cake recipe by five to get 30 cups and it turned out PERFECT!!
I spent too much time in the past throwing away batter or cakes because they tasted terrible but this one was the absolute best cake I have ever tried.
The batter tastes like chocolate pudding and the cake itself melts in your mouth.
I will definitely be trying all of the other recipes :)
Heavenly Highway Hymns
Heavenly Highway HymnsI ordered this hymnal because I learned to read shaped note music when I was a teenager.
I play piano but do not sing.
I am 85 years old.
This hymnal has mostof the songs I have learned over the years.
It was exactly what I wanted and needed.It was in good condition and the price was right.
I purchased this book from Amazon.
Warren plans to take a 'hard look' at running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she'll take a "hard look at running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might take on Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
It works great but I hardly use it.
I got it to have it if I needed it.
I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it.
If I was really good I can see the need.
But this is a keyboard not an organ.
Cannot recommend
I didn't expect this cable to be so thin.
It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used.
Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference.
If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable.
Still, it works and was inexpensive.EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already.
Wire frayed at the right angle jack.
You get what you pay for.
Unfortunate item.
I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item.
I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.
Cheap product
Cheap product!
Within two days of use it started to loose air where I found a pin size hole and is now no longer useable.
You could buy the same product (also made in china) at local stores for 1/4 the price.
I would not recommend this product.
spend the extra money on a better kit
used it for a year or so and definitely have had to buy better equipment.
the skinny cleaning rod- snapped.. the thicker cleaning rod- also snapped.
i'm not one to apply heavy force on these, they're just very soft/cheap.
the brushes are decent enough.
after spending cash on a nicer kit, i guess i learned my lesson.
if you have the funds skip and buy something a little nicer.
Midway Broadcasting announced today that its Chairwoman, Melody Spann Cooper is set to release her highly anticipated book to help female entrepreneurs and executives thrive in business. "The Girlfriend's Guide To Closing the Deal" shares insights on how women can use their voice to achieve equity at the negotiating table and advance their careers by using the female edition of the old-boy's network.
Throughout the book, Spann Cooper uses anecdotal references to deal with challenging issues including the #MeToo movement and Hillary Clinton's Presidential defeat and its impact on fueling the female empowerment in America.
The self-published book is the result of a groundbreaking self-entitled speech that Spann Cooper delivered as a keynote address at The National Association of Women Business Owners Conference in Chicago in 2017. The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal is written in a down-to-earth style that every "girlfriend" can relate.
Christie Hefner, businesswoman and daughter of Playboy Founder, Hugh Hefner, says "The Girlfriend's Guide to Closing The Deal" is both highly entertaining and very helpful. Melody weaves together personal anecdotes, triumphs, and setbacks with useful lessons learned. From how to own your ideas in a meeting to when its time to "friend up," everyone can benefit from Melody's story."
As Chairman of Midway Broadcasting Corporation, she joined an elite list of America's female broadcast owners after purchasing the company's controlling interest in 1999. Midway Broadcasting Corporation is a best-in-class female and family-owned media boutique whose properties include radio and interactive platforms.
The book was co-written with T. Shawn Taylor, journalist, writer and founder of Tree Top Consulting, a full-service media consulting firm.
It's OK but I wish I'd bought something else.
The handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and I feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers.
It's cheap and easy to use.
It'll do the job, but I don't like it.
Grooming Notes
As a self trained groomer, this was the best buy I've made in a long time.
It's a wonderful reference guide and it makes my job a whole lot easier.
I can find everything I need if I have questions about a breed or the AKC standards for the breed.
Great set.
I like it but I have to say I wish they included a way to "loop" the band over something to be able to do pull-down or back exercises.
I ended up using the "ankle" attachment to do that and works for me.
Quality is great and would definitely see this lasting me a long time.
I love the carabineer because you can use 2 or more at the same time with the handles once you get stronger.
Had to return...
This pruner does not even remotely cut 1" branches, wet or dry.
Does not cut 3/4" branches.
It may cut SOME 1/2" dry branches but at least the one I received was not sharpened and I was forced to return it.
Have not decided on a new one yet, since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different.
Man set alight on doorstep 'in targeted attack'
A man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old was soaked in flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, before bursting into flames outside his home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire.
He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.
Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.
Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: "This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital.
"We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.
"While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.
"Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
"Has a loved one come home acting suspiciously, smelling of smoke or petrol or with unexplained injuries?
"We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime."
Too Big.
Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big.
They stand out too much.
They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced.
There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.
Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant.
I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play.
Not cool.
Feathered Phonics volume 1
The CD is a good idea for teaching a bird to speak,but there are words on it that would never be spoken in our home so why teach them to the bird.
I will look through the other choices of CD's and try to find one with different words.

Outstanding Concept, and Performances
The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.
Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.
Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.
This is an annual "must watch" story for me.
1960's Classic Comes To This?
Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable.
I cringed when I watched this with my son.
I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic, rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes.
This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless.
Oops!
I said Christmas, I meant Happy Holidays!
UGHHHH!!!
The game doesn't save at all and that's really irritating because you can't turn your computer off without it completely deleting your progress.
Also it turns on and off randomly so when you exit the game all of a sudden it pops back up again.
My six year old thinks it's fun but he gets frustrated with it.
became a mess
Started out as a great road trip activity for my 5 yro but after the 2 yro used it, it became a mess.
The stix became stuck together or had hairs stuck to them.
It doesn't come with a reusable bag or anything so they are all stuck in a big ball to the top of the book right now - neither my kids nor I want to deal with organizing them.
Get the 13-disc box set from AmazonUK!
$117 on the secondary market for this inferior set?
HA!
Go to AMAZON UK and get the complete 13-disc set in a beautiful box set for about $84 shipped.
(I just received mine!
)It doesn't take Marvin, with a brain the size of a planet, to see which is better.
Good night sweet butterflies
I was very disappointed with the condition of this book.
It was listed as very good, but it was very very used.
I was unable to give it as a gift to my grandson, and had to put it in the thrift shop pile.
Of course I could not consider returning it because the book price was less then postage
Ok,tool does what a regular punch does.
I purchased this thinking maybe I need a special tool to easily pop off my base plates for my magazines, but it does the same as a regular punch tool.
Glock mags are a pain to get the base plates off.
The tool does not really make a difference.
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has massive respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely by bringing her on to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am keen to act as a voice for athletes and I am hoping I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.
Its been grueling work but made a full recovery, re-learned how to walk and today doing agility drills!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
Works great
I have several chargers.
Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each.
Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone.
That is always when you need it most.
This one works well for any of my products.
Worked great for about 5 charges
I used NiCD batteries for a time years ago and gave up on those.
When I tried the NiMH batteries I started with these ones and was very disappointed with the technology, we used it in a mouse that required about twice a week changes, later I changed to Sanyo's eneloop and I'm very happy.
Very handy, works well
I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5, because of the packaging it comes in.
The plastic is sharp & isn't that easy to carry in your bag without stabbing yourself on it, but without the plastic box, the magnifier would get very scratched.
I may discard the plastic box, but keep the magnifier in something soft, like a small sock.
Otherwise, the magnifier works great.
Now I don't have to grow up
I can color right along with my grandchildren, without feeling intellectually compromised at the project.
This book is so amazing that I have used some of the designs for stained glass windows.
I highly recommend this for anyone who does not want to grow out of a favorite pasttime.
Older batteries came out in a plastic case.
Item did not arrive on a cardboard card, it arrived in an easy to open plastic case and with the expiration date only 3 years out.
Fresh batteries have a 5 year expiration date.
The description and the picture of this item needs to be changed if they are going to sell Amazon customers a different and older item.
They were nice and sent me a return label free of charge.
Great to have so he can play with his alphabet ...
I have a stainless steel refrigerator therefore there are not much space for my son to play with his magnet.
Brought this for him to put his magnet on.
He enjoys sticking his magnet on it.
Great to have so he can play with his alphabet magnets.
A few good tips, but that's about it
If you actually want to make and decorate a cake, this book isn't much use.
The book is mainly composed of images of wedding cakes, most of which weren't remotely close to something I would consider.
Even if they had been something I liked, only a handful of them included instructions, which means I wouldn't have been able to make most of them anyway.
The book did have a few good tips and a few cake and icing recipes.
Essential text for the dog groomer
Are you a professional dog groomer?
Want to become one?
Then get this book!This book, along with the companion "Theory of five" are essential books for the groomer's collection.
Covering a vast number of dog breeds, it shows the standard pattern and cuts of these breeds and in some cases, such as poodles, scotties and those with slightly more "complicated cuts" it goes into a great deal of depth with detail and advice.Brilliant book!
A Must.
Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.
Great game still!
I had this game as a kid in the 90s and played it religiously with my sisters around our Windows 95 PC.
I recently bought it for my cousin's 6th birthday because I want her to build better computer and problem solving skills.
Computers and games have definitely evolved since then, but this is timeless game that helps kids develop those skills in a fun way without math equations and spelling.
Watching her play brought back really fond memories and made me want to play again.
"Whoever you are.... MAKE ME A PIZZA!"
I have bought many cables and this one is the only one that gives me problems
It hums, crackles, and I think I'm having problems with my equipment.
As soon as I use any of my other cords then the problem is gone.
Hosa makes some other products that have good value.
But based on my experience I don't recommend this one.

Every child should have this!
We had purchased Melissa & Doug magnets & had some made & went looking for a board.
THIS IS IT!
It is so reasonable and has been in use ever since we received it.
You can spell words, put the Leap Frog base on it to put in letters/animals, numbers, etc.
It is also double sided.
Even though it's not intended they also like to put things under/inside the board.
They can roll things through it.
Highly recommend & every child should have one to put their magnets on.
Quick and easy and economical
This was a great surprise for the money.
I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out.
At this price why not?
I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.
The door anchor worked great.
I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.
This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.
Pleasantly surprised and pleased.
I highly recommend.
Attempted murder charge over Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
This is album is absolutely Blessed!
As soon as it reached me, I played and listened to it and I had a flashback moment to the eighties when I heard it and when I saw him in concert just before his death.
I wept but smiled because I was soo blessed by the music and I hope you are encourage to get this as well.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed growth in "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty per cent of pupils said they have a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised "main" account to show parents, while also having private ones.
One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old's daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of those admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing so many teenagers are tempted into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Another Fake MAC on here, dont buy!
Why should you care?
Sales of fake MAC pigments are widespread across the Internet, so people often assume they must be safe or even identical to genuine MAC products.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
Fake MAC pigments have been analyzed to contain chemical irritants, bacterial contamination (including in at least one case e. coli) or even toxins like lead and carcinogens.
Do you really want to risk blindness or permanent facial scarring just to get a deal?
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim hip hop moved away from its origins of political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.

"The Nancy Pelosi Way" will be released Nov. 26, Skyhorse Publishing announced Thursday. Christine Pelosi's book will examine how a mother of five became the first female house speaker and her current leadership of House Democrats during the Trump administration. According to Skyhorse, Christine Pelosi will weave together "the professional and personal experiences" of her mother.

taste is awful
When I was incarcerated in a Mexican prison, this was the only drink in the joint.
We had to fix it with goat's milk and heat it over an open flame in the yard.
The taste is awful.
It's not pleasing like the thick, hot Chocolate found in Madrid.
So Delicious!!
Creamy white chocolate infused with Matcha green tea surrounding layers of wafers.
Much less sweeter than the traditional Kitkat.
Small size is perfect to satisfy the chocolate craving w/o the guilt.
Was in LA last week and picked up a bag on a whim at the Japanese store in Little Tokyo.
Now, back in WI and regretting not picking up a handful more.
Not only were these Kitkats delicious, the bags were only $5 each!
One in a million
I've been on the search for the perfect wedding cake recipe for over ten years.
You can call it an obsession as I personally love the way wedding cake tastes and I'm not even married!
I bought this book as soon as it was published and the recipes are incredible - as well as the photos.
For anyone who bakes wedding cakes this is one recipe book worth the investment.
Flavorless and not that strong
This brand of tea felt stronger in the past.
Now it feels more ordinary.Relative to other teas I have consumed, this one has no flavor whatsoever.
It is not even Organic, but that's okay as it was never advertised as such.I will not be buying it again.
Absolute Treasure
Everyone that dreams of designing beautiful cakes, should have this on their night stand.
I don't know how many nights I have studied it pages before going to bed, what an absolute treasure this book is.
It's like the Holy Grail of cake books.
You won't regret it.
great addition to your purse
Love the Great point light pocket magnifier!
works great, especially if you forget your glasses and can't read the menu when you are out for dinner.... the light is a bonus in a dark restaurant, too.
I would have given 5 stars if it came with a case that covers the glass.
The clear plastic case it comes in is a little tacky and I'd be willing to pay a little more for a nice case to protec the lens.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through waterlogged belongings, trying to salvage anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
Quality cable!
Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my M-audio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools.
Works great!
Firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.
(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything.
Couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility.
Not for bushes
I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!
!It was worth a try, but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush.
I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.
:>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application.
Don't waste your money.
This isn't worth your money.
Doug runs through each song in about three or four minutes, he doesn't give you time to learn it.Unless you've already mastered transcribing (and then why buy this dvd?
), you're going to be left to rewinding a million times to get the right notes.This is no better than a youtube video of someone playing a bunch of clapton songs.Doug doesn't even show you the rhythm or other guitar parts!
You're left only knowing the lead!What sense does that make?
Inricate and time consuming. A great chance to get or give (if gift) a break from television!
Very nice for time destraction.
Bought for my 14 year old niece.
Although she would rather have a controller or keyboard in her hand, I at times I give her this for a "technology break"!
I'm not opposed to this resistance!
I worked out once back in '08.
I picked up some 40 lb weights and was like - "too easy".
So then I grabbed some resistance bands and almost broke them.
Now I've been recommended Black Mountain products because they are very durable.
I've had a set of the 25 lb red resistance bands for 3 months now and they look as good as when I first got them after an hour of use every day except Sunday.
North Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr go top
Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully-entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They now top the table, the only unbeaten side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as much as their better chance-taking, which carried the home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested over our games this far, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Credit to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to make numbers tell and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted try.
Climo stretched the Ayr lead with a penalty, before, right on half-time, he scored then converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the leeway to five points.
There was then a lengthy hold-up for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was stretchered off, and from the restart, Ayr surged further ahead through a Stafford McDowall try, converted by Climo.
Ayr acting captain Blair Macpherson was then yellow-carded, and again, Melrose made the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
The home side came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellow-carded for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down at the back of the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo converted, as he did again almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth try.

Immanuel Christian School: Sixth-grade boys accused of pinning down black girl and cutting off her dreadlocks in Virginia
A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks. The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.
Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.
"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up. "They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.' They called me 'an attention-seeker.'"
According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.
Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.
"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.
The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different. She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.
"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother. "I want to see them dismissed from the school. I want to see something done."
Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.
"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement. "We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can. We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police."
While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her. She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.
Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.
Useless trap, horrible design
The coons steal the bait from this trap at will.
I've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it wouldn't engage the trip at first.
They advise putting bait past trip plate, but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait, another serious design flaw.
There are traps that work, this just in NOT one of those.
Save your money!
A Winner
This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4.
The S4 fits very well, is slim and doesn't add much weight to the Galaxy S4.
It doubles the battery life.
You can charge either the battery, the phone or both.
There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well.
Well worth the price.

Fonzie as Scrooge
Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive.
He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge.
The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers.
This one is fun and easy to watch.
A fine family film.
Waste of Money
This is the biggest waste of money - do not buy it - it will not work!It's just people saying a certain word, then a 10 second pause ... then a different word and another 10 second pause.
You can create your own if you really want to try this.But you really should not leave this on for your bird all day - it should be done in 10 minute intervals only or your bird may get irritated by it (i know i get irritated by it after only 2 words).Don't waste your money on this.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19.
"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompeo told a news conference.
U.S. officials in May said they'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time.
In April 2018, the U.S., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
"This is different in some sense because it was chlorine... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," Pompeo said.
He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use.
Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including American journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years.
"He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all."
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The President obliquely referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"All of what we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by using any means necessary, you see the meanness, the nastiness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And you see that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and nasty and untruthful."
He referenced Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which received loud boos from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I wait one - that was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
I Got Great Pricing, But Still a Really Good Product
When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X-15 foot controller, I came across these Hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each!
As they are now $6, I realize I would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly.
You must realize that they are only 5 feet, as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer.
For any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler vs. Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to toe the rubber knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be playing at probably the highest level of any point I would face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and would be pitching on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.
I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."
Just as hoped
I was worried about getting a short one, but this serves my need just fine, as it accompanied by a longer and more troublesome one.
I leave the sprinkler on it instead of switching heads - so much easier.
slightly stiff to lay out, but if it weren't, I am sure it would kink.
I got it with the gilmore brass 2-way hose connector - an excellent pair for me
Glock punch tool - needed for your Glock and other applications too
Needed this tool to really break down my G22, and it works perfectly for that.
No difference from OEM I suspect.However, had an added bonus when realizing that I needed a punch to properly disassemble the bolt carrier in my AR for a thorough cleaning, and this tool worked perfectly to push the carrier's retaining pin out and then back into place after the job was completed.
Excellent!
It is now in my range bag for safe keeping.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The car's driver had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release.
While he was occupied, another man "ran up from behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money meant for delivery.
Witnesses spotted multiple suspects fleeing the scene, according to the release, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
good
Not much to write about here, but it does exactly what it's supposed to.
filters out the pop sounds.
now my recordings are much more crisp.
it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it, they honestly work the same despite their pricing,
Nestle tightens controls on coffee beans after weedkiller scare
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.
Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup. In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate. Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys. Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG. It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.
Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said. "This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business. Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.
Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.
"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.
Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018. Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.
Does glyphosate cause cancer?
Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA. Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.
Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks. Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.
But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.
Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other. Bayer is contesting the verdict.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals. However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.

Disturbing
I can honestly say that this is my least favorite holiday movie.
As a child I remember being very upset by the images of Aaron losing his parents, being kidnapped and almost losing his sheep BaaBaa.
The best part of this movie is Aaron playing for baby Jesus and regaining his trust in people again otherwise, make sure you have a box of tissues when viewing this movie.
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University's campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, per 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Pet owners who fail to walk their dogs face $2,700 fine
Owners can face heavy on-the-spot fines if they fail to provide basics like shelter, food and water. People who confine dogs for 24 hours must also allow them to move freely for the next two hours or face prosecution.
The territory is the first jurisdiction in Australia to recognize animal sentience.
"Modern animal welfare is about considering how an animal is coping both mentally and physically with the conditions in which it lives," ACT City Service Minister Chris Steel, who secured the bill, said in a media release.
NOT REMASTERED! How can they even claim this?
Wonderful ,program, heartwarming story, and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..
This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.
It is the same dark, muddled, dirty, bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv , video, and dvd, for what?
forty years?
I was taken in, amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.
I'm tempted to take it back, but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd, instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more "famous" specials.
this is a knockoff, buyer beware
Don't buy this, it's a cheap knockoff.
MAC cosmetics has never made such a palette, and you have no idea who actually made this and what they ingredients are in the makeup.. it's unsafe to use and a waste of your money.
Save yourself the time and money, if you want authentic MAC, this is not the way to get it.
Bride to be help!
This book is very inspirational if you're looking for a cake that is unique or if you just don't know what your style is.
The front portion of the book helps you choose your style and the back half features specs on the cakes they show.
i.e.
how many people they serve, recipes, ect.
So this is what French coffee tastes like??? Don't believe it!!!
Perhaps the best coffee is in the US if this is any example.
Not really fond of chickory but felt it was worth the try.
Doesn't taste like coffee to me - but maybe should be called something else - something weak and not flavorful.
Stopped Working after 1 1/2 month..
This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows.. What a waste of money.
Father Remains Hopeful That Suspect Who Fatally Shot Son One Year Ago Will Be Caught
It's been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot, but the victim's family isn't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught.
"I wish I could trade places with you son, I wish I could trade places with you," Guy Alford, the victim's father, said.
Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic. He said he wanted to call attention to his son's unsolved murder.
"Somebody knows something, they need to say something," he said.
Security video, which has never been released, showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him. Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car. One of them walked up to the driver's side, and shot Alford. The four people in Alford's car jumped out and ran. The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away.
"Wherever this coward is, he will get caught," Alford said.
This grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son, and he said he still didn't know who was in the car with him when he was shot.
"They upped and ran out of my son's car like that, where did you run to," Alford said. "Did you go back and try to help him or what? Nobody said nothing."
Alford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team. Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse.
"He was working three jobs," Michael Harvey, a friend, said. "As somebody who's 21, he was a year younger than me, anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic, you tend to look up to."
As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues, Alford said he wasn't giving up either.
"I can assure you, this one is going to get solved," he said.
Alford is personally offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police.
beautiful wedding cakes
Just love this book!!
I got some great ideas from it.
It is well written, recipes easy to follow.
I did wonder whether this would be just another wedding cake book when I first saw it.
I am so glad I went with my gut feeling and bought it.
I love Martha Stewart items, this delivered well.
Be careful
I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging, it felt hot.
Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt.
Tried the other one too and same thing.
Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system
The worst kit out there
I bought this from Walmart for the same price as Amazon.
On my first use, the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one.
I will never buy anything with Outers written on it.
I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit.
Not For Hills
I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did.
I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either.
This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills.
It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass.
So I'm back to the mower.
One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push.
Works as well as the factory tool
I had a factory Glock tool that I was using for my Glock 26, 27, and 17.
I've since lost it and had needed another.
Since I've used Ghost products prior, and know that they are reliable, I had decided to order this one.
Sure enough, this is just as good as a factory tool.
$9.99, pretty and cute
The light comes on when the item is pulled.
This is much easier to use than the plastic bookmark magnifier and the bar magnifier I previously purchased.
I was glad to have it lit when I needed to see the serial number on the back of an ipod.
Logical follow-up to Tailchaser's Song
This work bears deep connections to themes first explored in Tad Williams' original breakout novel, about a brave young cat who travels to an underground netherworld to face an ancient evil.
As the owner of two cats myself, after the second read-through, I realized that this novel has much to teach about the critical importance of dealing with fur and dust.I could only give four stars, though, because the cats do not agree, and indeed wish I had not made this purchase.
Cinnamon Licorice powder
this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5-spice powder which I paid $1.5 for 4oz locally, despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce.
I live walking distance to Flushing Queens, and have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby.
If you want to go cheap off Amazon, you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder, 1.92-Ounce Bottle.
BTW "star anise" or "aniseed" is already a licorice flavor, so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish.
Excellent
Those that I stared I have and would recommend to others.
Payne did an excellent job of describing the market for on who hasn't a financial background.
Have enjoyed the prophet (book) for years and the recording of same by Harris I wore out 33rpm vinyl in college and replaced it with cd when it became available.
Original Audio CD Verison Still Available
With regard to concerns about the audio quality of the this MP3 version, the original audio CD version ("The Collector's Edition"), an 8-CD set, is still available from Amazon UK.
I paid a little more than twice the MP3 price.
The ISBN number of the Audio CD version is 0-563-47702-4.
Only 3 years, instead of 5 as promised
These were described as guaranteed for 5 years, but have an expiration date that is only 3 years (Mar 2016).
Since I am using them for battery back-up in clocks this is a real bummer.
Not what I expect from Amazon.
Will probably live with it rather than mess with a return.
It's about time...
I can't believe how long it took "them" to get this wonderful Christmas show on DVD.
It's a modern (1930s America) twist on Charles Dickens' classic tale.
Winkler makes me hate his character as much as Alister Sim did in his portrayal of Scrooge in the 1951 production.
Certainly one for your visual library.
love this!
Both sides are magnetic.
A real plus when you're entertaining more than one child.
The four-year old can find the letters for the words, while the two-year old can find the pictures the words spell.
(I bought letters and magnetic pictures to go with this board).
Both grandkids liked it a lot, which means I like it a lot as well.
Have not even introduced markers, as this will be used strictly as a magnetic board.
Don't buy if your lawn is larger than 10 sq yards
Couldm't cut my grass very well.
Misses some spots because it just didn't cut it.
if the grass is taller than 2 inches, this is not mower for you.
Need to spend the money and get something that works.
Fake MAC, not worth buying fake makeup!
Fake Mac.
Mac does not make these palettes, just call them and ask them.
Ask any MAc store in the local mall even.
One look at this picture and they know its not real MAC item.
Please stay away from items that are not genuine.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake which struck Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.
So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.
The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.
Still NOT completely remastered
In the item notes for this DVD it claims it is remastered.
Though it is not as poor quality as the 2004 DVD, it still has black dots and white scratches in the picture.
Is CBS the only place you can find the completely remastered version?
This is NOT worth $14.99, more like $4.99.
Remaster the thing or don't supply it.
:(
One of my favorite Christmas movies!
Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here.
This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.The acting is splendid and the story is well written.
It is suitable for the entire family and it gives a good picture of the depression era of our country.
I recommend you to try guys. I love all Macely line.
I usually don't bother to write reviews for products, but this one I simply could not pass up.
I have combination skin that gets really dry and really oily in some parts.I love this product.
I recommend you to try guys.
I love all Macely line.
Wonderful!!!
I had had a cassette of this recording, and knew I loved it.
I bought several of these CDs so that I could share with nephews, and friends, and keep one for myself.
Very gentle and easy to sleep to.
Words are clearly sung, understandable.
It's been a blessing to me that I was anxious to find and pass on to others.
Great for children-- I was a child when Grandma got me the tape.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became provider for Cownie's equaliser on 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first break when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Waste of money.
This is the same DVD series someone had given me back in 2007 and it stinks.
The camera moves too much, jerking around and I could have made a better video using my cell phone.
Only one of the 3 videos is remotely interesting to my cat, the same video she liked back in 2007 but after 10 min., she too is bored.
I cannot watch it, it makes me dizzy.
most embarrassing gift
Because when the person this was gifted to opened it there wasn't a brush was not on the eyeliner.and I was looked at like what a cheap gift!
!And was asked if it was a knockoff and then read the one review that was left.
Hoping to get it replaced or refunded.Very unhappy customer
Worst Christmas special ever!
This is so lame!
The songs are terrible!
The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show.
But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting!
Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.
It Does The Job Well
The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies.
The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration.
The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached.
The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.
DVD for Cats
Purchased this cat DVD for our active cat.
Hoping that it would keep his attention long enough to give me a break from playing with him.
I have to say that the first DVD is the only one that captures his attention for about 10-20 minutes.
The other DVD's he doesn't even look at.
Maybe I just have a cat that is just too active to sit still...I don't know.
I would recommend the first DVD only if you are thinking of trying it.
Great price and fast delivery.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, has given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
A must have for any homeschooling classroom !
This is good product to have with unlimited possibilities.
I also ordered the magnetic letters & numbers by Melissa & Doug.
The dry erase has to be erased quickly or they tend to leave marks.
Also, the magnet is not very strong.
It's a nice size & works very well for our needs.
Deptford road crash: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended, but the man died at the scene.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Great math game for your little Star Wars fan
My son who hates doing math loves to play this game.
I like the fact that you can also have two players so I can play against him to see his progress.You can adjust the voice and music volumes separately and it plays on my Windows XP which I know some have had an issue with.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Disappointing
The theory of 5 book is not a definitive publication.
It gives some easy guidelines and theories but does not delve deeper into proper technique.
The pictures are atrocious and are barely worth looking at.
I cannot recommend this volume to anyone but the most basic home pet owner.
Significantly overpriced for the offered content.
Flexible hose as marketed....hope it lives up to the hipe!
So far so good!
I have not really had the time to test out the hose as it is cold weather time right now.
I bought this Gilmour hose based on all the recommendations.
I am looking forward to not having to wrestle the hose to use it.
Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma
In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.
Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings. The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea. There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.
First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication. His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe." Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense. But is this reason enough to remain afraid? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?
As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.
That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur. In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence. In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.
I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently. A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well. Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation. It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals. He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?
Painful cramps with this......
Mother and I started drinking this back in the 1980's.
I stopped because it was causing me too much pain, slightly worse than menstrual cramps.
The herbs in this tea are strong.
I think I read somewhere where the Senna in this stimulates the bowels to contract.
This isn't really a weight loss product but more a laxative.
Expensive junk
I bought a pack of these a while back from Sam's Club.
I used them in my appliance remotes but noticed that they don't hold their charges for long thereby necessitating frequent recharges.
The cheap rapid charger 'CH30MN' that came with the battery pack did not help matters either as it heats the batteries up during the charging process to the point of being unbearable to touch.Save your money and buy the newSANYO NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesinstead.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTING ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger Counter became a pop culture mainstay as well, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado," starring those seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it sure is popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
disappointed momma
Ordered this for my son and was very disappointed when it did not work on our brand new CPU.
It appears it was not compatible with our system software.
My son tried it on two relative's CPU, and it did not work on theirs.Good thing I paid only $4.
Not worth the money
The CD arrived in excellent conditons and promptly.
The merchandise is not worth the money.
Too much of the original story is missing in the interest of cramming it in one CD.
Will leave you with a lot of questions on how did sherlock homes arrived at his results.
Your imagination will not be enough to fill out the gaps in the narrative.
good version of a classic
This is a charming version of the classic Dicken's tale.
Henry Winkler makes a good showing as the "Scrooge" character.
Even though you know what will happen this version has enough of a change to make it better that average.
If you love A Christmas Carol in any version, then you will love this.
Great pack!!
I had wanted to complete my collection of NFS, and this pack just had a title that didn't have yet ... worth mentioning that for the price you sold it, was impossible not buy it, no matter if I already had two of three games.Regrets that only deliver in the USA but the shipping is fast!.With offers how are you, I always buy on Amazon.
Love the game
I want to start off by saying I have never played the Call of Duty games.
This is only the second first person shooter game that I have own.
I think it is a lot of fun.
Has good graphics and nice story line.
It does take some skill to get through the levels.
I think all players can enjoy this game.
There are three levels to choose from based on your skill level.
If your looking for first person shooter game that has current military type play than this is a good buy.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down with death tolls expected to rise in coming days.
The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami smashed on shore.
Kindle Sample
I adore this book and must have misplaced it somewhere.
I was curious to see how the Kindle version was, due to things like formatting issues that sometimes occur.
Disappointingly, the free sample is only the forward.
Not even one page of the book.
The price is not bad in comparison to some Kindle editions, but the sample definitely didn't let me check out the book at all.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never ever use the military to repress the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on Oct. 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities draws youth to criminal gangs.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that allegation came out, said, 'Did you do it?'
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, appears set in stone.
"My mind's made up about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everybody she names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
Great flavor
I've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor.
I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand.
Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green, Red, and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types.
AMAZING COMPANY
Such fast shipping, games is such great condition she even included two extra's so nice of her.Now all i have to do is start up my old windows 2000 to play it and ill be happy as a puppy with a chew toy :)i recommend everyone to buy from this company they are so nice, lovely little messages included and made my day so much better seeing how awesome this person/company is.
It's a punch, that's all.
If you don't have a 3/32 punch or would like to have one in your Glock bag, this is okay.
The butt end of it is handy for pushing pins back in place.
If you already have a 3/32 punch and don't need another, don't both with this one.
Great sauce....if you have nothing else.
Low quality and low flavor hot sauce....not all that hot either.If you need some hot sauce and have nothing else around, then this will do, but that there are so many other choices, this is the worst choice to make.
Even regular tobasco sauce is much much better.I can only describe it as being similar to watery taco bell sauce.I would recommend Frontera Hot Sauce, Tobasco, or Cholula Hot sauce over this.
Absolutely love the case !!
Performs exactly as advertised .
It's very sturdily built,and provides lots of boost .
It does exactly what it's supposed too .Easy to insert phone in and out .
Definitely a 5 star experience.
Don't know what I would do without this case LOVE LOVE LOVE it.
'How dare you?' Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters
Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.

Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000. Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.
Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.
"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.
Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."
"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests. "We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems. But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs."
Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.
"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.
The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.
The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.
Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.
Nakedness not necessary!
The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.
Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph.
Not a Christian movie.
I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.
This should be rated PG 13 at least.
Band Discoloration
As most exercise products, these were used a few times, and stored away in the bag for a few months.
I took them out to start using them again after a car accident has kept me off the free weights, and the bands are starting to discolor and fade.
Makes me nervous that the integrity of the rubber is weakening...
the smell and color are different
Is there any difference between the one typed with A22 and the one with A82?
I don't know why, the one I bought here was totally different with the one I bought in Hk in smell and color.
I'm not sure if this is true.
We all know the text, but
this book is a small version of the original.
I ordered it and when I opened it I was very disappointed to find that it is not the industry standard that I knew.
Then I went back to see if I missed something about the size in the description, but could not find any reference to it.
On a positive note, Amazon's return policy is amazing.
Immediate Credit when informed of the problem and the return shipping was very easy.
creepy elf - extras is like investing in skylanders or disney xfinity
Here's a creepy little elf and a book.
If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity.
Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00.
This is awful quality too.
I would not recommend thistle anyone.
Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar!
Cute girly compact mirror
Single sided mirror.
The compact is iridescent but is primarily lavender with an aqua sheen.
The compact is slim but large enough to see your entire face.
The compact is the size of my palms and then some.
Great little mirror.
Not sure about the value for the retail price...mine was part of a package that I received.
The quality is a high enough though that the compact will last for several years.
I hate that these are so expensive
My Grandson got this and because of the movie, he got this one, but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable.
However, my Grandson (9 yrs old) loved this elf and his Momand Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays.
Broke extrememly fast, inconvenient.
The red band(heaviest resistance) started tearing the first time I used it, so for obvious reason I stopped and tried the black one.
The black one lasted fine for the exercise, but the next day it started ripping in the same place as the red one.
I will not use the other colors as they simply do not have enough resistance.
A big minus is that this set has only one pair of handles and to switch from one handle to another is a big inconvenience and a waist of time.
COLORFUL, lighted, pocket magnifier-easy to find in a black purse!
Most of the purses I own have black lining.
Good luck finding anything black in black purse!
I chose this color because I can actually find it!!!
It works wonderfully in a dimly lit restaurant, when the print is really small, when I need a light & a magnifier to find the splinter.
WONDERFUL.
Waste of $
If you want your bird to interact with you, then interact with your bird.
Parrots have the mental capacity of a 3-5 year old child.
This is like plopping your child down in front of the TV and calling it quality time.
Parrots learn to communicate dynamically not by rote.
I have 5 parrots and all are chatty because we chat, while cleaning, cooking, doing laundry.. whatever.
Turn off the TV and read aloud, talk, sing, dance.. be one of the flock.
An excellent product
This stuff is amazing.An excellent product.
Will keep your eye-liner and mascara on all day and night...and if you party too hard and fall asleep in your make-up..you can guarantee it will still be there in the morning!Ideal for dotting on your eyes and fairly effective at keeping on lipstick.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers hurt in disorder
Six prison officers have been injured in a disturbance at a high security men's jail, the Prison Office has said.
Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight inmates and is contained to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison's governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
If your package is orange & black, then send it back.
ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging, but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale.
Lights powered by them are semi-bright, and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier, MyBatterySupplier, I ordered the50-pack, which did come in the new hologram package, and the difference was dramatic.
Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant, and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars.
Tastes great!
I started a new diet restricting all added sugars.
This was one of the only brands I could find that didn't have sugar added into the ingredients.
And it tastes great to boot!
I'm not sure I could finish this whole tub before it goes off though.
How long does it last?
The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump's action by a 236-174 margin, sending it to the president. Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it. The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote, as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it.
Trump will likely veto the resolution, the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president. He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March.
Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president's opposition.
Failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared the national emergency in February. His administration plans to pull $3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects.
Democrats have accused Trump of both circumventing Congress' power of the purse and raiding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers. A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump's declaration would set for executive overreach in the future.
Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote.
A Worthy Version of A Christmas Carol
This is Charles Dickens' classic Christmas Carol with an American twist.
This version does a nice job of capturing the consequences of history and one's personal role in it.
It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, "A Christmas Carol," did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.
I recommend this film to anyone who collects different versions of, "A Christmas Carol."
Not for use with silverware
We received these salad plates and bowls from our wedding registry.
They are absolutely beautiful BUT NOT FUNCTIONAL.
It seems that they are meant to be used only with wooden utensils or chop sticks because any metal utensil used on the surface leaves a gray mark and makes an awful noise that is completely unbearable!
Enough that we have to purchase new dinner ware.
I really wish this was not the case because I love the design, just be aware before you buy!
Complete waste of time and money.......
This game would not install on any of my seven computers.
The installer is so dated that if it detects any hardware that it doesn't recognize (i.e.
modern hardware), it aborts.
Tried all the user forum tricks I could find.
None of them helped.
Even the publisher has abandoned this game and no longer supports it.
Complete waste.
Needless to say, my son was very dissappointed.
Don't bother with this one.
It's deprecated software meant for deprecated hardware.
Dual USB Port Car Charger
Purchased product about many a month ago.
Pros: Loved it work just fine!!
Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter!!
Can plug in two things at one time....Con: Top clear piece came off easily overtime (I just put clear tape around the top) TOTAL: PROS:95% CONS:5%
Boo! Dead batteries!
I just gave up and threw out these batteries, after only a couple of months.
I had them in rotation (with two other sets of rechargeables-- Duracell and Sanyo) in my digital camera.
In the beginning, they were fine and comparable to the other brands.
Now they don't even last one day in my camera.
Sometimes I get only a handful of pictures in before they die.
I don't have that kind of patience...
I won't buy Energizer rechargeables again.
The best "Christmas Carol" story
It seems like just about everybody has made a Christmas Carol movie.
This one is the best by far!
It seems more realistic than all the others and the time period seems to be perfect.
The acting is also far better than any of the others I've seen; my opinion.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into prison on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally shooting Wayde.
His bond has been set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head into the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens in assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Best racing game
i love this game i have had the best fun with this game if it does not work try it on a laptopif u like racing game you might like this.It is kinda old so be expecting that but other wise other than graphics it is grait
Amazing!
I ordered these in Summer so they of course arrived melted, a trip the freezer made them awesome again though.
Just order them in cooler times of the year and you should get them in good condition.I love these so much more than the regular chocolate Kit-Kat bars.
I hope some day to see them on store shelves in the US some day.
Not enough Matcha tea flavor for me ... (=_=)
I tried this for the first time today and it is delicious but I don't quite taste the Matcha flavor as you would in like say a Green Tea ice cream.
To me it tasted like white chocolate with a grainy texture which I'm guessing is the Matcha tea powder.
I think my favorite KitKat flavor mix is the Mocha.
Misleading
Nowhere in the description does it tell you that it won't run on any program newer than Windows 98.
I built a gaming computer that would have cost over $3K if you could buy anything close to it in a retail environment so I know it isn't my machine.
VERY disappointed as I am a very big Douglas Adams fan.
An AWESOME reference guide for any groomer
This is perhaps the best and most thourough book available for dog grooming.
As a professional groomer, I reference it often!
My only complaint is the spiral binding.
Perhaps because I use it so much..it has come loose and the pages are falling out.
That may be a testament to how good this book truly is!
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President obliquely referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide has told CNN.

Civil war Game
I don't know about the game because I can't play it.
I have widows vista and I can download the instructions, but error comes up when I try to play the game.
I contacted Ageod and they said I am the only one haveing trouble.
The internet says that Vista has a lot of game problems.
I just wasted my money on this game.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless it can trust US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals' leaders.
His comments come as US. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of restarting deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first making significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Erdogan get mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations beteen the NATO allies.
They've fallen out over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters turned out nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The dueling protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by others.
Solid Charger but RF noisy
This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.
When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.
Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars.
Spectacular Book!
Martha Stewart's Wedding Cakes book is exactly what I was searching for.
The clear instructions and gorgeous photographs are just perfect.
A true cake designer's favorite.
This is the first book I will turn to for ideas.And I have over 50 cake books in my library.
I couldn't be happier.
:o)
Loved it at first
I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots.
Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.
Great art -- framing problem
Paid extra to get the framed version of this artwork for my son's room.
Love the cartoon itself.
But was disappointed that the matting of the frame was a different color from what was depicted in the item's photo.
I sent an email to the company (Andrews McMeel Art) about a week ago and so far they haven't responded.Update -- the company has responded to my email with a very nice note that indicates they'll make things right.
I may end up a completely satisfied customer after I'll.
If so, I'll update again.
Okay but you can figure it out yourself without the book
I bought this when I bought the pop maker.
I think the recipes are fine, but there really isn't much in the book I wouldn't have figured out myself.A couple of good creamy recipes that are now available for free on recipe websites.
As for "pop embellishing" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either.
I'd save the money and spend it instead on extra pop sticks, which seem to disappear the way socks do....
Show me the money!
Interesting Grisham tale of a lawyer that takes millions of dollars from his firm after faking his own death.
Grisham usually is able to hook his readers early and ,in this case, doesn't play his hand to soon.
The usually reliable Frank Mueller makes this story even an even better bet on Audiobook.
Hurts my ears.
Came across this accidentally and took it home to play--thought it might be a good gift for a seven year old I know.
Games are fun, so far as I could stand the decibel level.
For me to hear the voices, the music was so loud that the total sound hurt my ears.
If the relative loudness of the music and voices were reversed, this would be a better product.
Gilmour 8-ply Flexogen Hose 25 Foot
This little hose was purchased to add on to my other 50 foot hose due to the very humid and oppressive weather this last month in the Northeast.
It is very flexible and easy to handle and allows me total reach of the back perennial garden.
i would recommend this hose
Great game!
My seven year old has had a lot of fun with this game while learning math at the same time!
Bought it for him when he was in kindergarten and he still loves to play it.
No problems with the noise of this game - no noisier than any other PC game.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also made do with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Cute!
Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition.
However, I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector.
I never received one.
Though its not a big deal, it would've been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one.
Durable Instrument Cable
This Fender cable is the perfect length for me!
Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I don't mind.
The build quality is great and I know that it will last.
The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often.Sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.
The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.
"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the one with her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "entirely preposterous."
Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive
The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .
When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
French chemical fire extinguished as questions mount
French authorities and Normandy residents are clearing up residue from a huge fire at a chemical plant as a foul stench continues to spread over a swath of territory.
No one was injured in Thursday's fire at a lubricant plant in Rouen, but residents have expressed concern about possible health risks and consequences for the nearby Seine River.
The head of the regional administration said Friday the fire was extinguished Thursday night after nearly 24 hours. Firefighters are still on the scene.
The administration warned of a new odor released after the fire was put out, saying it could spread to neighboring regions.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said people in fragile health should remain indoors through Friday night.
The cause of the fire is being investigated. The plant is among the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
Very Cheaply made product.
As I write this review this product is coming apart,most of the workmanship was glue together and taped with doublesided tape which is not sticking and this item has not even been used yet.
I have not even had the oppurtunity to use this product to to countining to make repairs.Very unsatisfied with this item.
