In the last few years, there are many small kittens (including the loser troeteldier cat) who eat far more small prey such as insects, knaagdiere, lizards and birds.

The new environment has different resources and other competition, so the new population will need other features of adaptations than what their ancestors needed to be strong competitors.
The original population has not changed much, but they still need the same adaptations as the previous ones.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands of years of self-development, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.
