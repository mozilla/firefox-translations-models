Last month, there were major protests in Poland when that country signed ACTA, which has led to the Polish government deciding not to ratify the agreement, for now.
Latvia and Slovakia have both delayed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian abattoirs.
RSPCA New South Wales chief inspector David O'Shannessy told the ABC that surveillance and inspections of abattoirs should be commonplace in Australia.
"The CCTV would certainly send a strong signal to those people working with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority."
The United States Geological Survey international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland in the week prior.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the past 48 hours.
The significant earthquake activity resulting in the phase change had took place on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's summit caldera.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were reported at the base of the mountain.
The clouds presented the potential for confusion as to whether an actual eruption had taken place.
The Luno had 120–160 cubic metres of fuel aboard when it broke down and high winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
Helicopters rescued the twelve crewmembers and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre ship was en route to pick up its usual fertiliser cargo and initially officials feared the vessel could spill a load.
The proposed amendment already passed both houses in 2011.
A change was made this legislative session when the second sentence was deleted first by the House of Representatives and then was passed in a similar form by the Senate Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex civil unions, could possibly open the door for civil unions in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be reviewed again by the next elected legislature in either 2015 or 2016 to remain in process.
Vautier's achievements outside of directing include a hunger strike in 1973 against what he viewed as political censorship.
French law was changed. His activism went back to age 15 when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in a 1998 book.
In the 1960s he headed back to newly-independent Algeria to teach film directing.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was announced as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
As well as a former Olympic and World champion, Saito was the All Japan Judo Federation training committee chairman at the time of his death.
At least 100 people had attended the party, in order to celebrate the first anniversary of a couple whose wedding was held last year.
A formal anniversary event was scheduled for a later date, officials said.
The couple had married in Texas one year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of the four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not hurt.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English tutor who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory who claimed to have 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes he used words which some parents considered coarse, and he reportedly used profanity in class.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
He has also been accused previously of copyright infringement, but was not charged.
A former student said that he 'used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes, and was just like the students' friend.'
During the last three decades, despite officially remaining a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic size has grown by 90 times.
For the first time, last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the biggest market for this industry.
China's GDP could be larger than the United States within two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is far from landfall, it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the United States or Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, Bobek gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
No one else has ever made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted the best player in Partizan's history.
The celebrations started with a special show by the world-renowned group Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then Whirling Dervishes took to the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
To finish, Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia performed the show "Troy".
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
While on his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike, and was then struck by fellow racer Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately attended to by the on-track medical staff and transported to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat was unhurt in the accident.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero continued by saying that "the financial system is a part of the economy, a crucial part.
We have a year-long financial crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the past two months, and I think now the financial markets are beginning to recover."
Last week, Naked News announced that it would dramatically increase its international language mandate to news reporting, with three new broadcasts.
Already reporting in English and Japanese, the global organization is launching Spanish, Italian, and Korean-language programs, for television, the web, and mobile devices.
"Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene, as people tried to break windows in order to get out.
People were hitting the panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the panes finally broke, and they started to get out by the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very hard problem to solve and will take many years before we see useful fusion reactors built.
The steel needle floats on top of the water because of surface tension.
Surface tension happens because the water molecules at the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than they are to the air molecules above them.
The water molecules make an invisible skin on the water’s surface that allows things like the needle to float on top of the water.
The blade on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them. The two edges allow for a better grasp of the ice, even when tilted.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, as the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge which is in contact with the ice also curves.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.
The light bulb then needs replacing. It is necessary to be careful in replacing the light bulb.
First, the switch for the light fixture needs to be turned off or the cable disconnected.
This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metallic part of bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partly in the socket.
The major organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood goes away from the heart in tubes called arteries and comes back to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
A triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very tough branches and roots.
Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves.
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How would Io's gravity pull on me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.
The Sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The whole Sun is made out of gases, fire, and plasma.
The gas becomes thinner as you go farther from the center of the Sun.
The outer-part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.
Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.
However in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to reclaim his country from Danish domination.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success.
Hangeul is the only purposely invented alphabet in popular daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most highly regarded.
He originally named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the correct sounds for the instruction of the people".
There are many theories to how Sanskrit came into existence. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit just faded due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.
With the battle for France over, Germany began to get ready to invade the island of Britain.
Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.
Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
Now for Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for an extended amount of time.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.
German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war Germans aren't trusted to have many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king lists.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of the past were robbed, this tomb was left virtually undisturbed.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artefacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spoke wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. About 1000 B.C., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Possibly the most known person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is a mathematician Pythagoras, mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles.
There are varying estimates for how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not very closely related dialects are counted.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one character "Õ/õ" was added.
As time passed, many words that were borrowed from German coalesced. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, earning a 2:2 (a lower second class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.
European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) includes 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in south west Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the world's 37th-largest country, and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence dates from 1839.
Present-day parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past but became Belgian after the 1830s Belgian Revolution.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but it was occupied in both World War I and World War II by Germany.
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization which is today known as the European Union.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro District (in Phondey Village).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire caused for only some of the relics of the Drukgyal Dzong to remain, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining to be one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
During the 18th century Cambodia found itself squeezed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 18th century the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who are employed work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, where the country is a net exporter, even though only one percent work in the oil industry.
Early in the nation's independence, Singapore Botanic Gardens' expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical Garden City.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the nation's national flower.
Every year around October nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel towards the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for the rains.
And then back to the north through the west, once again crossing the Mara river, after the rains in around April.
The Serengeti region contains the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, story telling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you re-assess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires that components of a project connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for prime lenses.
This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses hard to use in low-light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan.
Most televisions are made in a way to please the general public.
For that reason, everything you see on the TV had the borders cut, top, bottom and sides.
This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. That is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, it's borders will most likely be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, conjuring up images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even standing amidst thousand year-old ruins it is easy to bring to mind the sounds and smells of battles long gone, to almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobbles and to smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical for the period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a true castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.
In the 1480s, when its construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against small bands of roving marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance.
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of being religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in an act of arson committed by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, outraged, announced that Herostratus' name never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, which is how we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly - also try not to make much extraneous motion with your fingers.
This way, you will tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember there's no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano.
On the accordion, to get extra volume, you use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/the deity or dieties.
Followers pursue certain ways of living, or practices that are intended to nurture those experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism though they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi for "way of the guru". The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions but in Sikhism has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). There followed in succession a further nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers were protesting against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against Communism.
Although in the end, Krushchev sent in tanks to restore order, he did give way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwest Indian subcontinent encompassing most of modern-day Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
The civilisation flourished in the basins of the Indus River wherefore it derives its name.
Although some scholars speculate that since the civilisation also existed in the basins of the now dried up Sarasvati River, it should be aptly called the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, while some call it the Harappan Civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman empire aided in the development of medical advances.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps for use in the aftermath of battles.
Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from herbane seeds.
They became proficient at amputation to save patients from gangrene as well as tourniquets and arterial clamps to stem blood flow.
Over multiple centuries, the Roman empire led to great gains in the field of medicine and formed much of the knowledge we know today.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that only one fold may be done at a time, more complex folds like reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have straightforward locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes quite young and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For instance, children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to not do well in school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and has 54 million profiles currently.
These websites have gotten a lot of attention, especially in the education setting.
There are positive aspects to these websites, which include, being able to easily setup a class page which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can easily be accessed by providing just one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be customized to make it easy to read and also with as much or little color as desired.
Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms including impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy".
It is not a learning disability, it is a learning disorder; it "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children".
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school work, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy doing like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they "engage in risky behaviors, get into fights, and challenge authority" in order to stimulate their brain, since their brain can not be stimulated by normal methods.
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children can not understand why they act the way that they do or why they spell they way they do or that their maturity level is different.
As the ability to obtain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was obtained changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. No longer did pressure reside within individual recall, but the ability to recall text became more of a focus.
In essence, the Renaissance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands in locomotion or bearing weight or swinging through the trees.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the hand's use for bearing weight in knuckle walking.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanges.
Fossil hand bones two million to three million years old reveal this shift in specialization of the hand from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams often enough can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the lucid dreams expanding the length of time between REM states.
With fewer REMs per night, this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body recovers becomes infrequent enough to become a problem.
This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect is dependent on how often your brain attempts to lucidly dream per night.
Things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussars had seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and apparent heir to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.
The modern sport of fencing is played at many levels, from students learning at a university to professional and Olympic competition.
The sport is primarily played in a duel format, one fencer dueling another.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls into holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, with players usually starting on the first hole on the course and finishing on the eighteenth.
The player who takes the fewest strokes, or swings of the club, to complete the course wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is mown shorter and called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with traveling: Recreation tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their regular day-to-day life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and camp grounds are often the most common places frequented by recreational tourists.
If the objective of one’s visit to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different landmarks of a particular country or they may simply opt to focus on just one area.
The Colonists, seeing this activity, had also called for reinforcements.
Troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 men, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men took positions along the fence on the north end of the Colonist's position.
When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it.
The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, in order to block off any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent any enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, in order to launch a pre-dawn attack.
With the change from the quarter to the half mile run, speed becomes of much less importance and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course a first-class half-miler, a man who can beat two minutes, must be possessed of a fair amount of speed, but endurance must be cultivated at all hazards.
Some cross country running during the winter, combined with gymnasium work for the upper part of the body, is the best preparation for the running season.
Proper nutritional practices alone cannot generate elite performances, but they can significantly affect young athletes' overall wellness.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of the sport.
Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions regarding the few pieces of equipment required to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it provides no real benefits.
The atom can be considered to be one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
Its a very complex entity which consists, according to a simplified Bohr model, of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, somewhat similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
To Check the victim, you must first survey the scene to ensure your safety.
You need to notice the victim's position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.
If you get hurt trying to help, you may only serve to make matters worse.
The study found that depression, fear and catastrophising mediated the relationship between pain and disability in lower back pain sufferers.
Only the effects of catastrophizing, not depression and fear was conditional of regular weekly structured PA sessions.
Those participating in regular activity required more support in terms of negative perception of pain distinguishing the differences of chronic pain and discomfort feel from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see depends on visual system sensory organs or eyes.
There are many different constructions of eyes, ranging in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.
The different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wave-lengths and have differing degrees of acuity, also they require different processing to make sense of the input and different numbers to work optimally.
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographic area.
When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular phenotypic trait they are known as monomorphic.
When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are polymorphic.
Army ant colonies march and nest in different phases as well.
In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed everyday.
Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts for approximately 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was first coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of life".
The Nervous System maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through out the body to keep the flow of blood going as well as undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body which helps keep the body safe from any potential threat.
Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, rip boards from buildings, and fling cars up into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both nearer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit there will always be more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly
Hopefully, most people will realise that their long term best option is to work together with others.
Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what's out there some belive that aliens or other life may live on another plant.
But, if this ever does happen probably won't happen for a very long time. The stars are so spread out that there are trillions of miles between stars that are "neighbors".
Maybe one day, your great grandchildren will be standing atop an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of many cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (though not even all animals do; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
Animals are found all over the earth. They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans, and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living (things) organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another and not change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. The compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that is all around us, and affects everything we do, yet is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events passing from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly.
Computers today are used to manipulate pictures and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be constructed on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly being used in television and films.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds together.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham islands these were Maori who migrated away from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori there were a few skirmishes and in the end, the Moriori were wiped out
Individuals who had been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while candidly assessing difficulties and even failures.
While listening to individuals share their individual, family, and organizational stories, we gained valuable insight into the past and some of the personalities who influenced for good or ill the culture of the organization.
While understanding one’s history does not assume understanding of culture, it does at least help people gain a sense of where they fall within the history of the organization.
While assessing the successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and the whole of the participating persons discover more deeply the values, mission, and driving forces of the organization.
In this instance, recalling previous instances of entrepreneurial behavior and resulting successes helped people to be open to new changes and new direction for the local church.
Such success stories lessened the fears of change, while creating positive inclinations toward change in the future.
Convergent thinking patterns are problem solving techniques that unite different ideas or fields to find a solution.
The focus of this mindset is speed, logic and accuracy, also identification of facts, reapplying existing techniques, gathering information.
The most important factor of this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain science or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Humans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others.
That means we are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know or desire.
Among these abilities, understanding the intention of others is crucial. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you were to see someone breaking a car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger’s car.
He would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals.
In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later a patent was granted, which was the world's first patent issued in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “whole-body” MRI scanner, which he called the ”Indomitable”.
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others.
It allows students the ability to work at their own pace and control the pace of instructional information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of day and expect reasonably quick responses, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning offers the freedom from absolutes. There is no one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn.Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself and information presenting, learning-based television shows illustrates this point.
So many of us find ourselves watching a television show that informs us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never overhaul a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbour's house.
Thanks to undersea fiber optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected with 93% of the population having internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if staying in a guesthouse or private home) will likely have wifi or an internet connected PC, and all settlements have an internet cafe or some location with public wifi.
As mentioned above, though the word "Eskimo" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered pejorative by many non-U.S. Arctic peoples, especially in Canada.
While you may hear the word used by Greenlandic Natives, its use should be avoided by foreigners.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), a Greenlander, in Greenland.
Crime, and ill-will toward foreigners in general, is virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in the towns, there are no "rough areas."
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger the unprepared will face.
If you visit Greenland during cold seasons (considering that the further north you go, the colder it will be), it is essential to bring warm enough clothing.
The very long days in the summer can lead to problems getting sufficient sleep and associated health issues.
During the summer, also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit any diseases, they can be irritating.
While San Francisco's economy is linked to it being a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diversified.
The largest employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism.
Its frequent portrayal in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known throughout the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and top-notch convention facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the nation for other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.
Traveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport, busing to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney property, and returning home.
There are infinite variations possible, but this remains what most people mean when they talk of "going to Disney World".
Many tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets.
While this is a very common activity, it is prohibited by Disney: the tickets are non-transferable.
Any camping below the rim in Grand Canyon requires a backcountry permit.
Permits are limited to protect the canyon, and become available on the 1st day of the month, four months prior to the start month.
Thus, a backcountry permit for any start date in May becomes available on 1 Jan.
Space for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground adjacent to Phantom Ranch, generally fill up by the requests received on first date they are opened to reservations.
There are a limited number permits reserved for walk-in requests available on a first come, first served basis.
Entering Southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the region's beauty as well as to get to places off the normal tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning but a 4x4 is highly advised and many locations are only accessible with a high wheel base 4x4.
Keep in mind while planning that although Southern Africa is stable not all neighboring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and are affected by the country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws requiring what emergency items need to be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The town lies immediately next to the falls, and they are the major attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure seekers and sightseers plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.
In the rainy season (November to March), the water volume will be higher and the Falls will be more dramatic.
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the Falls.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the volume of water is so high that your viewing of the actual Falls will be obscured—by all the water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the scene of Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of the almost intact royal burial of the young king.
Compared to most of the other royal tombs, however, the tomb of Tutankhamun is barely worth visiting, being much smaller and with limited decoration.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage to the mummy done during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time would be best to spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the hill worthwhile.
A visit to the site can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
The Angkor Pass is needed to enter the temple so do not forget to bring your passport along when heading to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, though most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel's capital.
The ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.
The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Due to the religious significance of the city, and in particular the many sites of the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historic, archeological and cultural sites, along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers, cafés, and restaurants.
Ecuador requires that Cuban citizens receive an invitation letter prior to entering Ecuador through international airports or frontier admission points.
This letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and comply with certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to provide an organized migratory flow between both countries.
Cuban citizens who are US green card holders should visit an Ecuadorian Consulate to obtain an exemption to this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates. A round/onward trip ticket is needed to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you're by yourself or with just one friend, try to meet other people and form a group of four to six for a better per-person rate.
However, this shouldn't really be off your concern, because often tourists are shuffled around to fill the cars.
It seems actually to be more a way of tricking people into believing they have to pay more.
Towering above the north end of Machu Picchu is this steep mountain, often the backdrop to many photos of the ruins.
It looks a bit daunting from below, and it is a steep and difficult ascent, but most reasonably fit persons should be able to make it in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps are laid along most of the path, and in the steeper sections steel cables provide a supporting handrail.
That said, expect to be out of breath, and take care in the steeper portions, especially when wet, as it can become dangerous quickly.
There's a tiny cave near the top that must be passed through, it is quite low and a rather tight squeeze.
Seeing the sites and wildlife of the Galapagos is best done by boat, just as Charles Darwin did it in 1835.
Over 60 cruise ships ply the Galapagos waters - ranging in size from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place well in advance (as the boats are usually full during the high season).
Be sure the agent through whom you book is a Galapagos specialist with a good knowledge of a wide variety of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or constraints are matched with the ship most suitable to them.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups, that were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (amid the Napoleonic wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for a couple of years), decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti
Besides white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and Caribes. The Caribes were an Arawakan-speaking people who had arrived around 10,000 BCE.
Within a few short years following the arrival of European explorers, the population of Tainos had significantly been reduced by the Spanish conquerors
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias) between 1492 and 1498 the Spanish conquerors killed around 100,000 Taínos.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was built as the atrium for a 17th-century convent, of which the Templo de San Diego is the sole surviving building.
It now functions as the central plaza, and always has a lot of things going on, day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden, and in the afternoons and evening there free concerts are often given from the central gazebo.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters is home of an old love legend.
For a few pennies some children will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend excursion offering kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants, and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just off Vancouver, and is easily accessed via scheduled water taxis departing Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trek up the Sea to Sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive but well-known because of the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In the winter, enjoy some of the best skiing in North America, and in the summer try some authentic mountain biking.
Permits must be reserved in advance. You must have a permit to stay overnight at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station that offers dormitory lodging and hot meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos offer only camping with no food service.
It is possible to secure park permits directly from the Ranger Station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The Park Service (MINAE) does not issue park permits more than one month in advance of anticipated arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of US$30, or $10 for one-day passes; details on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island country in free association with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands spread out over 2.2 million km2 of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes thought of as "Hawaii down under".
Though smaller, it reminds some elderly visitors of Hawaii before statehood without all the large tourist hotels and other development.
The Cook Islands do not have any cities but are composed of 15 different islands. The main ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries today, providing deluxe bed and breakfasts has been raised to a sort of art-form.
At the top end, B&Bs obviously compete mainly on two main things: bedding and breakfast.
Accordingly, at the finest such establishments one is apt to find the most luxurious bedding, maybe a handmade quilt or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delights of the region or the host's speciality dish.
The setting might be an historic old building with antique furnishings, manicured grounds and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and heading off on a long road trip has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations.
Setting up a tent on private property or in a town of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, using your car is a great way to take a road trip but seldom in itself a way to "camp".
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon with seats that lay down.
Some hotels have a heritage from the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners; before the Second World War, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were where the rich and the famous of the day would stay, and often had fine dining and nightlife.
The old fashioned fittings, the lack of the latest amenities, and a certain graceful agedness are also part of their character.
While they are usually privately owned, they sometimes accommodate visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A traveller with piles of money might consider a round the world flight, broken up with stays in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is the organization that connects travelers with locals in the cities they are going to visit.
Joining such a network usually just requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verification.
A listing of available hosts is then provided either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews by other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but did not have a place to stay.
He emailed students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels cater primarily to young people – a typical guest is in their twenties – but you can often find older travellers there too.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels do allow them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will be the host city of the Olympic Winter Games in 2022, which will make it the first city to have hosted both the summer and winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor ice events.
Other skiing events will be at the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most of the temples do have an Annual festival starting from November end to Mid of May, which varies according to each temple's annual calendar.
Most of the temple festivals is celebrated as part of temple's anniversary or presiding deity's birthday or any other major event associated with the temple.
Kerala's temple festivals are very interesting to see, with regular procession of decorated elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities.
A World's Fair (commonly called World Exposition, or simply Expo) is large international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries present artistic and educational displays in national pavilions to showcase world issues or their country's culture and history.
International Horticultural Expositions are specialised events which showcase floral displays, botanical gardens and anything else to do with plants.
Although in theory they can take place annually (so long as they are in different countries), in practice they are not.
These events normally last anywhere between three and six months, and are held on sites no smaller than 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. Standard 35 mm film (36 by 24 mm negative) is much the commonest.
It can usually be replenished fairly easily if you run out, and gives resolution roughly comparable to a current DSLR.
Some medium-format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format, more precisely a 56 by 56 mm negative.
This gives resolution almost four times that of a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
Wildlife is among the most challenging motifs for a photographer, and needs a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but like photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, though things like a flock of birds or a tiny creature need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about taking photographs for commercial purposes.
Wild animals might either be shy or aggressive. The environment might be cold, hot, or otherwise hostile.
The world has over 5,000 different languages, including more than twenty with 50 million or more speakers.
Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words, also. This is especially true of addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly.
Many entire nations are completely fluent in English, and in even more you can expect a limited knowledge - especially among younger people.
Imagine, if you will, a Mancunian, Bostonian, Jamaican and Sydneysider sitting around a table having dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
They're regaling each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their distinct accents and local argot.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to get fed. Without cooking opportunities, choices are however limited to ready-made food.
Increasingly supermarkets are getting a more varied section of ready-made food. Some even provide a microwave oven or other means to heat food.
In some countries or types of stores there is at least one on-site restaurant, often a rather informal one with affordable prices.
Make and carry copies of your policy and your insurer's contact details with you.
They need to show the insurer's e-mail address and international phone numbers for advice/authorizations and making claims.
Have another copy in your luggage and online (e-mail to yourself with attachment, or stored in the "cloud").
If traveling with a laptop or tablet, store a copy in its memory or disc (accessible without the internet).
Also give policy/contact copies to traveling companions and relatives or friends back home willing to help.
Moose (also known as elk) aren't inherently aggressive, but will defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
When people don't see moose as potentially dangerous, they may approach too closely and put themselves at risk.
Drink alcoholic drinks with moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and knowing your limit is very important.
Possible long term health events from excessive drinking can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger is increased when consuming illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous impurities including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Eyeglasses can be cheaper in a foreign country, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Consider getting an eye exam at home, especially if insurance covers it, and bringing the prescription along to be filed elsewhere.
High-end brand-name frames available in such areas may have two problems; some may be knock-offs, and the real imported ones may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded commodities, and you can probably find many types in your home region.
Nevertheless, there are many distinctive ways of drinking coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning (or: canyoneering) is about going in a bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping--but requires relatively little training or physical shape to get started (compared to rock climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor activity which consists of walking in natural environments, often on hiking trails.
Day hiking involves distances of less than a mile up to longer distances that can be covered in a single day.
For a day hike along an easy trail little preparations are needed, and any moderately fit person can enjoy them.
Families with small children may need more preparations, but a day outdoors is easily possible even with babies and pre-school children.
Internationally, there are nearly 200 running tour organizations. Most of them operate independently.
The Global Running Tours successor, Go Running Tours networks dozens of sightrunning providers on four continents.
With roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, it was quickly joined by Running Tours Prague based in Prague and others.
There are many things you have to take into consideration before and when you travel somewhere.
When you travel, expect things not to be like they are "back home". Manners, laws, food, traffic, lodging, standards, language and so on will to some extent differ from where you live.
This is something you always need to keep in mind, to avoid disappointment or perhaps even distaste over local ways to do things.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for a journey which extends beyond a traveller's previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings, many agents specialise in particular types of travel, budget ranges or destinations.
It can be better to use an agent who frequently books similar trips to yours.
Take a look at what trips the agent is promoting, whether on a website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world on the cheap, for necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are some ways to do that.
Basically, they fall into two categories: Either work while you travel or try and limit your expenses. This article is focused on the latter.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to push expenses down close to zero, see minimum budget travel.
The advice assumes that travellers do not steal, trespass, participate in the illegal market, beg, or otherwise exploit other people for their own gain.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when disembarking from a plane, a ship, or another vehicle.
In some cross-border trains inspections are done on the running train and you should have valid ID with you when boarding one of those trains.
On night sleeper trains, passports may be collected by the conductor so that you do not have your sleep interrupted.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and address where you are staying with the local authorities.
This might require filling out a form with the local police or a visit to the immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will handle the registration (make sure to ask).
In other cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodations need to register.  However, this makes the law much more obscure, so find out beforehand.
Architecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in its own right.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or from a cleverly-positioned window can be a beauty to behold.
Architecture overlaps considerably with other fields including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how remote many of the pueblos are, you won't be able to find a significant amount of nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, nearly all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them bring in name-brand entertainment (primarily the large ones immediately surrounding Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: small-town bars here are not always good places for the out-of-state visitor to hang out.
For one thing, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of intoxicated drivers is high close to small-town bars.
Unwanted murals or scribble is known as graffiti.
While it's far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth vandalizing public and private property using spray paint.
However, nowadays there are established graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. Graffiti paintings in this context often resemble artworks rather than illegible tags.
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.
If you want to learn throwing a boomerang that comes back to your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang for returning.
Most boomerangs available in Australia are in fact non-returning. It is best for beginners to not try throwing in windy
A Hangi Meal is cooked in a hot pit in the ground.
The pit is either heated with hot stones from a fire, or in some places geothermal heat makes areas of ground naturally hot.
The hangi is often used to cook a traditional roast style dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be sampled in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded but slightly more expensive, though still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Every train has both MetroPlus and Metro coaches; the MetroPlus coaches are always on the end of the train nearest Cape Town.
Carrying for others - Never let your bags out of your sight, especially when you are crossing international borders.
You could find yourself being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge, which will land you in a great deal of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug-sniffing dogs could be used at any time without notice.
Some countries have exceedingly draconian punishments even for first time offenses; these can include prison sentences of over 10 years or death.
Unattended bags are a target for theft and can also attract attention from authorities wary of bomb threats.
At home, due to this constant exposure to the local germs, odds are very high that you're already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna are new to you, you're far more likely to run into problems.
Also, in warmer climates bacteria both grow more quickly and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the scourges of Delhi Belly, the Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge, and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in hot climates are fairly common and in most cases are distinctly annoying but not really dangerous.
If traveling in a developing country for the first time – or in a new part of the world – don't underestimate the potential culture shock.
Many a stable, capable traveler has been overcome by the newness of developing world travel, where many little cultural adjustments can add up quickly.
Especially in your initial days, consider splurging on Western-style and -quality hotels, food, and services to help acclimatize.
Do not sleep on a mattress or pad on the ground in areas where you do not know the local fauna.
If you are going to camp out, bring a camp cot or hammock to keep you away from snakes, scorpions and such.
Fill your home with a rich coffee in the morning and some relaxing chamomile tea at night.
When you're on a staycation, you have the time to treat yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew up something special.
If you're feeling more adventurous, take the opportunity to juice or blend up some smoothies:
maybe you'll discover a simple beverage that you can make for breakfast when you're back to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't frequent.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have distinct meanings.
An infectious disease is one that is caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacterium, fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease which is easily transmitted by being in the vicinity of an infected person.
Many governments require visitors entering, or residents leaving, their countries to be vaccinated for a range of diseases.
These requirements may often depend on what countries a traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of strong points of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it has an abundance of high-quality options for families.
Residents from other areas often cite family-friendliness as a primary reason for moving there, and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children around.
In the past 20 years, the amount of child-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are not generally used by families in Charlotte, though they can be of some use in certain circumstances.
There is a surcharge for having more than 2 passengers, so this option might be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are costly, demand physical fitness, can only take place in summer Nov-Feb, and are largely limited to the Peninsula, Islands and Ross Sea.
A couple of thousand staff live here in summer in some four dozen bases mostly in those areas; a small number stay over winter.
Inland Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered by 2-3 km of ice.
Occasional specialist air tours go inland, for mountaineering or to reach the Pole, which has a large base.
The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1600 km trail from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It's compacted snow with crevasses filled in and marked by flags. It can only be traveled by specialized tractors, hauling sleds with fuel and supplies.
These aren't very nimble so the trail has to take a long swerve around the Transantarctic Mountains to come onto the plateau.
The most common cause for accidents in winter is slippery roads, pavements (sidewalks) and especially steps.
At a minimum, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough in cold temperatures.
Some boots have studs and there is studded add-on equipment for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for the heels or heels and sole.
Heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often scattered on roads or paths to improve traction.
Avalanches are not an abnormality; steep slopes can hold only so much slow, and the excess volumes will come down as avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so it needs some triggering to come down, and some snow coming down can be the triggering event for the rest.
Sometimes the original trigging event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
A tornado is a spinning column of very low-pressure air, which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become "tornadoes" when they touch the ground.
Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers are an excellent way of circumventing both political censorship and commercial IP-geofiltering.
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: They re-route all Internet traffic, not only http.
They normally offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and thus harder to spy on.
The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming that it is to "prevent piracy".
In fact, region codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; a bit-for-bit copy of a disk will play just fine on any device where the original will.
The actual purpose is to give those companies more control over their markets; it's all about money spinning.
Because calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a phone company located where you live or where you travel.
There is also no requirement that you obtain a local number from the community in which you live; you can obtain a satellite Internet connection in the wilds of Chicken, Alaska and select a number which claims you're in sunny Arizona.
Often, you have to buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to call you. Where the number is from makes a difference for people calling you.
Real-time text translator apps – applications that are capable of automatically translating whole segments of text from one language into another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smartphone towards those objects.
The translation engines have improved dramatically, and now often give more or less correct translations (and more seldom gibberish), but some care is due, as they still may have gotten it all wrong.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when out of your home country.
It can save money over buying new maps for a GPS, or a standalone GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or when it is out of range, their performance can be limited or unavailable.
Every corner store is filled with a confusing array of pre-paid phone cards that can be used from pay phones or ordinary telephones.
While most cards are good for calling anywhere, some specialise in providing favourable call rates to specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is often through a toll-free telephone number that can be called from most phones without charge.
Rules regarding regular photography also apply to video recording, possibly even more so.
If just taking a photo of something isn't allowed, then you shouldn't even think of recording a video of it.
If using a drone, check well in advance as to what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licensing are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Nowadays air travel is only rarely booked directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight can have vastly differing prices at various agregators and it pays to compare search results and to also look at the website of the airline itself before booking.
While you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business, going there as an international student generally requires a longer stay than going there just as a casual tourist.
In general, staying in any foreign country for an extended period of time will require you to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures from normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need an offer letter from the institution you wish to study at, and also evidence of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course.
Check with the institution, as well as the immigration department for the country you wish to study in for detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, working overseas generally means that you will have to file income tax in the country you are based in.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and the tax rates and brackets vary widely from one country to another.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal level and at the local level, so the rates and brackets can vary from region to region.
While immigration check is usually absent or a formality when you arrive in your homeland, customs control can be a hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot bring in and declare anything over the legal limits.
The easiest way to get started in the business of travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blog website.
After you become comfortable with formatting and editing on the web, then later, you might create your own website.
Volunteering while travelling is a great way to make a difference but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere since many volunteer jobs provide room and board and a few pay a small salary.
Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check possible need for special permits, which may be difficult to get.
The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mostly by rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to Volga, so coming from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Be assured that once you hit the marinas everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their information with you.
Basically you'll be putting up notices offering your help, pacing the docks, approaching people cleaning their yachts, trying to make contact with sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone will know you and will give you hints as to which boat is looking for someone.
You should choose your Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance carefully.
Although you may think it is intuitive to join the airline you fly most, you should be aware that privileges offered are often different and frequent flyer points may be more generous under a different airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways & Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their services to Africa, and offer connections to many major African cities at competitive rates than other European airlines.
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries as of 2014.
If you have additional travel time, check to see how your total fare quote to Africa compares with a round-the-world fare.
Don't forget to add in the extra costs of additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.
If you want to fly around the world completely in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam covers none of the crossings).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris.
With Armenian backing, a new republic was created. However, no established nation - not even Armenia - officially recognizes it.
Diplomatic arguments over the region continue to mar relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district surrounding the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.
The whole district is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest of the country.
Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, comprises the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that overlook the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible corporate development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages, and cars cannot reach them from the outside.
The varieties of French which are spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, though they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.
In particular, the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some slight peculiarities that are different from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned standard French in school, so they would be able to understand you even if you used the standard French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture, indicating "hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means "come over," similar to the index finger bent toward the body, a gesture which is used in certain Western countries, and should be used only for that purpose.
Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may mistake a wave goodbye involving the palm facing the waver (rather than the person being waved at) as a gesture to come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the intent of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are separate from lingua francas, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for one reason or another as means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers can experience mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler pursue the mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest of deserts can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothing.
In summer, especially, you'll need to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to hike through the rainforest.
Even if you're driving through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open while you get inside the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get in the vehicle with you.
Bird flu, or more formally avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have ever been reported in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
Most have involved people who work with poultry, but there is also some risk to birdwatchers.
Typical for Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less even plateau.
These plateaus are often referred to as "vidde" meaning a wide, open treeless space, a boundless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called "hei" meaning a treeless moorland often covered in heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain. This will cause cracks, crevasses, which may be obscured by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and cracks can get closed.
At the edge of glaciers huge blocks break loose, fall down and perhaps jump or roll farther from the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations generally peaks during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during winter, with many hill stations receiving healthy amounts of snow and offering activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer bereavement fares, which slightly discount the cost of last-minute funeral travel.
Airlines that offer these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights originating from the U.S. or Canada, and WestJet.
In all cases, you must book by phone directly with the airline.
