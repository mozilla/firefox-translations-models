Honoka becomes [Minami Tanaka style hair]!
Report the whole picture of the cut (CanCam.jp ) --Yahoo! News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long hair to make your hair fluffy
CanCam model Honoka, "Of course she's beautiful, but she has a very high level of professionalism and I respect her!"
We asked Mitsuteru Asahi of the hair salon "SUNVALLY" in Omotesando, who is actually working on Minami Tanaka's haircut, to make it "Minami Mi-style hair".
We will report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Mizuki Yamashita becomes short hair and covers for the first time!
First of all, check the faint hair before cutting.
Thin, soft, plentiful.
It has a habit, especially during the rainy season, so I sometimes apply a straight perm because it becomes blurry.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing bangs.
Finally, the cutting begins!
To make it easier to cut, lightly wet the whole thing first.
After that, the top of the bee (the part above the circumference that protrudes the most from the head) is separated and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are the points of hair that can make you closer to Minami-san!
1 Tabular Bangs By shortening the inside of the bangs just a little, they are slightly thicker when they are fully pulled down, and when lightly parted, they are see-through so that the skin can be seen through... You can enjoy the change depending on the styling.
2 Cut that makes the most of your habit If a person with a habit of hirsutism reduces the amount of hair too much, it may spread unnecessarily.
While consulting with them about the balance around that, we maintain a balance that is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and that allows our own swells to live.
3 Layers around the face and hair Layer = A cut that is cut with steps.
If you put a layer around the face, it will be easier to move and give it a cute finish.
If you make the hair in three places, in front of and behind the temples and sideburns, it will look fashionable even when you quickly put your hair together.
If you cut the hair on the bee that you have separated, it will be around the face.
Pull out the upper strands of hair around the face forward and cut the ends of the hairs.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be a step, and it will be easier to move (this is a layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura "Partnering with Gurunavi" against Corona (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
Osaka Prefecture Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura (45) appeared remotely from the prefectural office on ABC TV "Cast" in Osaka on the 20th (Monday ~ Friday after 3.48) and revealed that he is considering a partnership with the restaurant information website "Gurunavi" as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
From the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture will issue "Infection Prevention Declaration Stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to the citizens of Osaka Prefecture.
However, only 11,000 restaurants in the prefecture alone are issuing stickers.
Therefore, Governor Yoshimura declared, "I'm thinking of doing it at the end of the month, but I'm going to partner with 'Gurunavi' and put out a store that issues declaration stickers when making a reservation, so that you can know at the reservation stage."
"The important thing is not to lump them together as 'night towns,' but to clearly distinguish between stores that are taking measures against infectious diseases and those that are not. It is also important to make efforts to increase the number of stores that do it."

The exhibition "Toyosawa Town History and Culture Exhibition" by the Toyosawa Town Promotion Association (Chairman Kenji Nakamura) in Hanamaki City will be held from the 25th at Kenji's Square in Kamimachi, Hanamaki City.
Poet and children's story writer Kenji Miyazawa (1896~1933) exhibited a notebook that recorded that he and the residents of Toyosawa Town, the same city where he grew up, sent donations to the areas affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 23 (Taisho 12).
It is a valuable document that shows the connection between Kenji and Toyosawa Town, and introduces it along with the culture and history of the town.
Until August 23.
The notebook was discovered by Yuji Ito, a 60-year-old member of the association and an employee of a group in Toyosawa Town, the same city, when he was sorting out the warehouse at his home last summer.
It was used by my grandfather-in-law, Genzo Takahashi (1900~85), who ran a general store in the local area.
On September 15, it was written "Tokyo City Earthquake Relief Fund Solicitation (Veterans)", and along with the symbols "○" and "×", the names of Kenji and the residents of Toyosawa Town at the time, and the amount of donations are written.

No. 4 Yasuda V hits, Toritani hits 2 runs (Baseball King) --Yahoo! News
● Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte ○ <10th round, MetLife Dome> Lotte's starter, Atsuki Taneichi, threw 136 pitches in the ninth inning by himself, and was pleased with his first professional shutout in his fourth year.
It was his third Pacific League shutout of the season and halted the team's losing streak at two.
Taneichi allowed leadoff man Shohei Suzuki to reach base in the first inning with a double down the third-base line, but he struck out Sosuke Genda on a grounder to third, and Masaru Suzuki, who was trying to advance the bases, was also touched out at third base.
With the help of the calm response of his teammates' defense, he survived the early pinch with zero, and from the second inning onward, he tossed the Seibu batting line with a combination of slider and fork, mainly his vaunted straight.
Pick up the pitch and line up the zeros on the scoreboard.
The bats struggled to hit the opposing starter, Keisuke Honda, but No. 3 Takeshi Sugano led off the seventh inning with a walk to load the bases, and substitute runner Taimi Oka stole second.
Taking advantage of this opportunity, No. 4 Naonori Yasuda hit a right-handed shot to finally break the balance.
Then, in the eighth inning, they attacked the opponent's third baseman, Tetsu Miyakawa, and scored four runs in one fell swoop, including a two-run single to left-center field, which was the first RBI single since Kei Toritani, who had come on as a substitute.
He pushed the Marlins' young ace and decided the game in one fell swoop.
Taneichi retired three batters in the eighth inning and continued to pitch in the ninth inning after 100 pitches.
"I was overwhelmed," he said, adding back-to-back walks loaded the bases with two outs, but he ended the game with his 10th strikeout of the day on a high pitch from Spangenberg.
She smiled and choked on joy.
Bye-bye to accidents in new games Tsuruoka Police Department collaborates with related organizations to raise safety awareness|Yamagata Shimbun
At the bicycle class held as the start event of the operation, a collision experiment between a car and a bicycle was conducted = Tsuruoka City, Shoko Gakuen Driving School
The Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Keizo Sato) has launched the "Bye-Bye Zero Accident Strategy" in an attempt to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have a high rate of occurrence in the area in recent years.
In addition to raising awareness of accident prevention together with traffic safety organizations in the jurisdiction, we will work to strengthen the crackdown on violations of traffic rules by bicycles.
There have been three fatal traffic accidents in the department this year, with people driving motorcycles and bicycles dying.
Although the number of accidents is decreasing, the rate of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30, and the rate of accidents involving motorcycles is about 5.8%, both higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the rate of bicycle accidents in the past five years has been higher than the prefectural average, and we planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation is a combination of "bike" and "bicycle" to mean accident eradication.
We will ask related organizations to provide driving guidance to the elderly and to use luminescent reflectors in traffic safety classes and other events.
The police will issue yellow cards (guidance warning sheets) in the event of a crackdown to warn people to be careful.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held on the 21st at the Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City.
About 30 people attended the meeting, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in order to reduce even one tragic accident."
The person in charge of the department presented the policy and the activities of each group.
As a starting event for the operation, a bicycle class was held.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact applied to a bicycle differs when the vehicle collides with a bicycle with the brakes applied and when it collides at a speed of about 55 kilometers per hour without stepping on the brakes.
Koichi Kaneuchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee, said, "I realized once again the horror of traffic accidents, and I would like to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."

MOSCOW (Kyodo) -- A demonstration protesting the detention and dismissal of Governor Furgal in Russia's Khabarovsk Region of the Russian Far East was held on the 25th.
The demonstration lasted for 15 consecutive days, which was an unusual situation.
The brunt of the criticism is also directed at President Putin.
Security forces have not taken the usual steps to detain people en masse in the capital, Moscow, and the administration's cautious stance of taking into account the sentiments of the population is evident.
Former Governor Furgal, who belongs to the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, won a landslide victory over the incumbent candidate of Putin's ruling party "United Russia" in the 2018 gubernatorial runoff election with about 70% of the vote.
He was one of Russia's few non-ruling governors, but was detained by security forces on Monday.
The charges were announced as involvement in two murders of businessmen in 04~05.

"Amabie" Bizen Pottery Produced by Okayama University Special Needs School Students: Sanyo Shimbun Digital |
Students at Okayama University Special Needs School (Hirai, Naka-ku, Okayama City) are making Bizen ware figurines of the monster "Amabie", which is said to quell the plague, as a gift for the elderly in the community.
Due to the influence of the new coronavirus, it is difficult to conduct sales training at stores and interact with local residents, so we planned the event in the hope of an early convergence of infectious diseases and good health.
Eleven high school students have been working on the project three days a week since June as part of their classes in the morning.
After the clay that has been stretched with force is molded by die-cutting, straw is wrapped around it to bring out the "scarlet pattern" that is unique to Bizen ware.
Including the drying and firing processes, it is said to be completed in about 2~3 weeks.
An 18-year-old third-year student said, "I'm working hard to make it with the hope that the elderly will be able to spend their time in good health without losing to the new coronavirus."
On the 27th, Bizen ware plans to deliver 40 pieces to residents of Okayama City Yurakuen (the same place), a nursing home for the elderly with whom they have interacted with each other, such as performing in chorus.
Production is scheduled to continue until the end of July, and the recipients of the remaining works will be decided in the future.

Both Tora and G are highly praised, Hanshin / Wada TA "Still top class" ( Sankei Sports ) --Yahoo! News
On the 24th, Akashi Sho, one of the top four teams in the Koshien Tournament last spring and summer, faced Takasago in the first game (second round, Takasago City Baseball Stadium) and started the game 11-0 in five innings.
Third-year pitcher Shunsuke Nakamori, a 151-kilogram right-hander who is a top draft pick, pitched three innings of no-hitter with seven strikeouts.
The 57-year-old technical advisor to the headquarters of the Hanshin Wada Yutaka baseball team, who also visited the stadium, also praised the performance.
Due to continuous rain, the start was delayed by 39 minutes due to maintenance.
Muddy mounds.
Still, I was excited because it was the first official match of the year, which I had been waiting for.
He gave up one walk in the final inning, but pitched a no-hitter.
He struck out seven and allowed zero in three innings to help earn the five-inning win.
"Overall, I was floating, and it was good that I was able to get a swing on the straight, but I want to correct the fact that I was able to identify a low changeup." Nakamori's self-assessment was harsh, but he recorded the fastest speed of the day at 148 km/h, and the eyes of the professionals behind the net from Hanshin, Giant and Orix were highly evaluated.
Hanshin Wada TA made their first visit to the tournament since their first match at Koshien last summer (2nd round ○ 4-3 Tokuei Hanasaki).
"He's growing, he's still one of the top high school students. Even if I didn't go down, my form didn't collapse and I was able to control it well. I think he's going to be a top contender."
The Giants scout also commented, "It was the best I've seen in a while.
It's amazing that we have finished it despite the Corona disaster."
At the end of June, he said that he was "half between going pro and going on to higher education," and he said, "I want to go pro, but I can't decide yet," he said after the Koshien exchange match (against Kiryu Daiichi) on August 16.
Before that, the goal is to win this tournament, which ends in the last eight.
The rule is that 20 players can be renamed on the bench for each match.
All 16 third-year players played in this game as well.
They have to win the remaining three games to qualify for all 39 third-year players.
"It's the last tournament after three years of hard training, so hopefully we can get all the third-year players together. I want to win everything, including Koshien. I've always been told by my coach that I don't have a shutout, so I'm going to try to do that." The team and individual have set their sights on the final summer.

Butler praises Tyler Hero, the young warrior who will lead the future of the Heat, again "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" ( Basket Count ) --Yahoo! News
Photo = Getty Images The Heat's first game of the scrimmage (practice game) was against the Kings.
In the 104-98 win, Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points and Tyler Hero followed with 15 points.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, as well as the rookie and hero who was the 13th overall draft pick, will be an important factor for the Heat.
Hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season went into a long hiatus after his return game against the Hornets on March 12.
"I had a lot of time to get back to 100% shape, it's the best feeling I've ever felt," Hero said, but his performance in the scrimmage was more convincing than words.
The late arrival of starting point guard Kendrick Nunn gave the Hero more playing time, and the team took advantage of that opportunity.
He scored 15 goals in a different role than usual, so it's worth a lot.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his favorite hero.
"He's a handler, he can score, he can defend, he's a player who can do everything for the team. I can play any position because I don't have that mindset of a rookie. I'm watching the footage, studying it, and I'm thinking about where and how my teammates are moving and what I need to do about it."
Even before the start of this season, Butler has liked the hero's rookie-like toughness and stoic approach to basketball.
That's why I invited him to my private training session at 4 a.m. and trained with him.
Butler once said, "He's going to give his opinion to everybody and he's not going to back down, and I respect that kind of fighting spirit."
Butler is the type of person who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it is in the best interest of the team, he will give harsh opinions knowing that there will be conflicts.
In the past, this has led to a deterioration in his relationship with his teammates.
Butler seems to be superimposing his younger self on his hero.
Butler's personality, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to keep up.
If the mutual respect between the two mentors and apprentices spills over into the entire team, the Heat will be a team that can go even higher.

▽ 4th Round (Kusanagi 1st Match) Hamamatsu Johoku 0000000-0 410000×-5 Shimada Sho ▽ Match time 1 hour 26 minutes
Comment: Sho Shimada took advantage of the early opportunity to win the shutout against Hamamatsu Johokuko.
Sho Shimada opened the scoring with the bases loaded with no outs in the first inning on Matsuura's two-run RBI single.
He added two more runs on an infield grounder and a squeeze.
Starter Saito pitched six scoreless innings, allowing only one hit.
Hamamatsu Johoku failed to capitalize on a two-out bases-loaded opportunity in the final inning.
■ Three years led to the fourth round
2 years Matsuura, grateful first strike
It was the sophomore No. 4 who made his first appearance this summer.
Matsuura, a Shimada Sho, hit a changeup with the bases loaded and no outs in the first inning and carried it to left field.
"For three years, if I lost, I would retire immediately, and I wanted to bat and win."
The talented player who played No. 4 last fall was proud.
In the 1st ~ 3rd rounds, I mainly fought for 3 years, and in the 2 years when I was strong, I was sent to the reserves.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players together in a meeting and told Nine, "Three years have helped us get to this point, and we will go with the best squad from now on."
On this day, four of the nine starters were solid in two years.
It may seem ruthless, but it is proof that they are committed to serious competition.
Matsuura is reassured, saying, "From now on, the level of the opposing pitchers will increase, and I will go in with the intention of sending the runner home."
Saito, who pitched back-to-back innings, allowed just one hit in six innings and didn't even allow a runner to reach second base, showing his three-year streak.
The number 10 has a positive reception as a synergistic effect, saying, "Two years will inspire us for three years, and if it leads to victory."
The team, which is aiming to finish in the top four for the third consecutive year including last year's Shizuoka tournament, has no intention of using the remaining matches as a memory.
16 musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world of singing voices with the people of Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) --Yahoo! News
I want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka, and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians from Fukushima Prefecture came together to create a message song.
Moving toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, he engraves in his lyrics the dedication of Fukushima Prefecture in its fight against the new coronavirus.
Infused with the singing voices of the people of the prefecture, the "complete version" will be completed by next summer, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video posting site "YouTube".
The song is called "Pray from Fukushima".
The positive attitude of the people is put on a bright and energetic melody with the desire to "convey from Fukushima".
Due to the influence of the new coronavirus, live music venues that serve as bases for music activities have been forced to close, and many musicians have lost the opportunity to sing and perform.
In an uncertain time, Nappo (46), a singer-songwriter living in Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O (37) of the music group "Mexicali Boys" in Iwaki City planned to believe in the power of music.
Nappo writes and composes the music, while Dazuo is in charge of rapping.
When the project started in March during the coronavirus pandemic, singer-songwriters MANAMI (28) and Jun Kanno (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle quickly expanded.
Nappo says with emotion, "It has become a gorgeous lineup that is unthinkable in normal times, and I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest."
As a precaution against infection, there were no opportunities for the 16 people to get together, and each of them recorded at a live house or at home.
In order to support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew an image character.
In the shape of Fukushima Prefecture, the blue and green colors express the rich natural climate.
The completed song will be disseminated to the world on YouTube, and the goal is to make it into a CD.
Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the disaster, and the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are also scheduled to be held.
Dazuo said, "We have a lot to carry on our shoulders because we have overcome difficulties, and I hope that by releasing a song at a milestone, we will be able to encourage many people."

Instantly detects the occurrence of a crisis from online information, also judges hoaxes (JBpress) --Yahoo! News
"I want to know where and what kind of disasters and accidents have occurred as soon as possible!" 」
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but there is a strong need for it in many companies, such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
The service that responds to this is "Specti" developed by Spectee, which analyzes information using AI.
Photos: Alerts from Specti Determine the Authenticity of Social Media Information by a Specialized Team
Nowadays, the means by which people first learn about the occurrence of disasters and accidents is beginning to shift from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to constantly monitor the overflow of information and extract useful information from it.
Specti has a function to detect information related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyze the content, determine the authenticity of the information, and distribute it to the user company.
"A wide range of events with a negative impact that halt or stagnate social activities are positioned as 'crises,'" said Kenjiro Murakami, CEO of the company, and is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
NHK was the first major use case of Specti at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016, and the adoption movement has since spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to news organizations such as TV stations and newspapers, more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, as well as municipalities across the country, are currently using Specti.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of the "crisis"
Specti distributes information in four steps: "information gathering", "analysis and content classification", "titling", and "authenticity determination".
The user company specifies in advance the area (prefecture, municipality, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.) to be collected.
Specti collects posts that fall under that designation using APIs provided by social media.
It then analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos in the collected posts.
For example, if you see a video of a fire truck, black smoke coming from a building, and orange flames coming out of a room, classify it as a "fire."
In addition, an image of an overturned car is classified as "traffic accident", and an image of a road covered with water is classified as "road flooded".
Specti also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from the posts, so we use a combination of various information to make estimates," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or billboard is reflected in an image or video, the place name information is extracted from it and compared with the place name database to identify the location.
Angels lose season opener in walk-off ... Ohtani struck out on three pitches with the bases loaded in the first and ninth innings of 5 (Baseball King) --Yahoo! News
○ Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <July 24, Oakland Coliseum> Shohei Ohtani (26) of the Angels started the season opener against the Athletics on July 24 (Japan time, July 25) as the No. 3 designated hitter.
He had his first hit of the season in the first inning, but was mediocre in his next four at-bats, going 1-for-5 with one strikeout.
Ohtani faced Montana again with one out in the third inning and grounded out.
In his third at-bat of the fifth inning with the score tied at 1-1, he faced Pettitte, a right-hander at second, with one out and the bases loaded.
In his fourth at-bat of the eighth inning with a 2-1 lead, he faced left-hander Diekman in the fifth.
He bounced the second pitch straight the other way at a good angle, but it didn't go over the fence and fell to left field.
The Angels took a one-run lead in the bottom of the eighth inning when right-hander Batley gave up two runs, but in the top of the ninth, rookie catcher No. 7 Castro hit a solo shot into the right-field seats, the team's first of the season.
They tied the game at 3-3 at the last minute.
Then, with two outs and the bases loaded, Trout batted second.
The Athletics bench shunned Trout at this point, opting for Ohtani with the bases loaded with two outs.
Ohtani was expected to hit the winning run, but he struck out on three pitches before Hendricks, the Athletics' guardian god.
The game wasn't decided in the ninth inning, and the game went into extra innings, starting with a bases-loaded game with no outs, which is a special case this season.
Ohtani was the last batter of the ninth inning, so he had a runner on second base.
In the top of the 10th inning, the Angels hit a hard grounder to first base by leadoff hitter Walsh, but Olson, the first baseman, made a good catch of the batted ball and sent it to third base.
Ohtani, who was caught between second and third base, was called out for a touchdown.
The Angels then loaded the bases with two outs, but Simmons grounded out to second in the eighth.
In the bottom of the inning, the Angels loaded the bases with runners on second and third with one out on a wild pitch and a wild pitch by Robles, who straddled the inning.
Maddon's new manager shifted the infield to five men, but Robles walked Davis in the fourth to load the bases.
Milner, a left-hander who replaced him, drove a walk-off grand slam into the right-field seats in the fifth to tie the game.

Sandbags and temporary bridges are swallowed by the swollen river and washed away.
Shortly after 3 a.m., a surveillance camera installed by the prefectural Iida Construction Office in Qiao Ki Village captured the incident.
This is a circuit built on the riverbed instead of the prefectural road that was closed due to landslides, and from the 17th, only residents' cars were able to pass through.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area have been isolated again, and the Iida Construction Office hopes to start restoration work as soon as the water recedes.

"Cheating crowded" Can't you say "uchiuchi" ... ? ?
"Words that I thought were not really dialects" asked by the people of Chiba Prefecture ( Netorabo ) --Yahoo! News
I am a resident of Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo.
I have lived in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used the word "zuru crowding," which means "sideways," in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), I was momentarily taken aback.
I was able to understand the meaning by the flow and the sense of the words, but the people of Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture told me that they would not use it.
― ― Surely "Is it to cheat → crowd and slip in the side?" 」
Since it seems to be connected, the meaning seems to be somewhat guessed.
And one more thing.
I didn't realize this when it was pointed out, but the expression "uchiuchi", which means "my house", was not used at all even when I read books, etc., and I didn't hear it from my friends, so when I looked it up as an adult, it was a dialect.
― ― Eh, "Uchiuchi" ... ... ... Was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't notice it because I didn't use it naturally after I became an adult.
Japan's "chilled Chinese" doesn't appeal to the Chinese ... ?
Why "cold noodle dishes" are unpopular (modern business) --Yahoo! News
Chilled Chinese noodles in China are "Japanese-style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese cuisine (Japanese-style Chinese) that originated in Japan, based on the Chinese "Liang Bang Mien" (chilled mixed soba noodles).
Therefore, it did not originally exist in China, but due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japan restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced arrangements of products labeled "Japanese-style soba cool-face / soba chilled Chinese" and "Kawaka-style chicken silk cool-face / Sichuan-style chicken chilled Chinese".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China is generally not high, pushed by trendy and punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the Japanese Chinese flavor is often familiar to the Chinese.
Therefore, it is not unpleasant, but if it lacks impact, it tends to be criticized.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese in China is "Japanese style cold noodles".
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japan cuisines.
The summer staple is "Liang Pee"
In China, the noodle dish that makes you feel summer is probably "Liang Pee".
In Japan, many people may not be familiar with it, but Ryo skin is a flat noodle made of wheat flour, rice flour, starch, etc. that originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of 2,000 years.
It is a standard B-grade gourmet sold at street stalls, and the price is very reasonable, around 10 ~ 20 yuan (150 ~ 300 yen).
It has the word "cool" in it, but it is not sealed with ice like chilled Chinese in Japan.
Rather, room temperature is the basis.
The noodles are topped with your favorite ingredients such as shredded cucumber, carrots, and boiled bean sprouts, and condiments such as coriander, chili, ginger, and garlic are added.
Finally, a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc. is added.
The noodles, which are well throated and twitchy, are often entwined with a rich spicy sauce with a refreshing acidity, and they can slip in even when you have no appetite due to summer heat.
In addition, since it has penetrated all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the wide variety is also a characteristic of Ryo Skin, which is one of the ways to enjoy it.
Experts explain!
The benefits of "cold shower" for the body and mind (Cosmopolitan) --Yahoo! News
Reduces inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in "The North American Journal of Medical Sciences" that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (treatment using water) found that it can be expected to have an effect on physical and mental healing.
Bathing in cold water after exercise can help reduce muscle soreness and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, who is in charge of the Korey Stringer Institute, which researches sports medicine, and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold shower as soon as possible.
Reduces fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"When you exercise, your heart rate rises, which increases blood flow to your heart, and it takes energy to contract your muscles, so muscle blood flow increases, and when it comes to your skin, more blood flows to regulate your body temperature," Casa says.
"Cold showers lower the temperature of the skin, which reduces the amount of blood sent to the skin, but instead sends blood flow to the internal organs, such as the stomach and intestines, making it easier to get water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercising."
Expected hormesis effect
Drozevsky also explains that bathing in cold water can be expected to activate the "hormesis effect".
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances and stress for the body than no one at all.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting, and cold showers are prime examples of hormesis benefits for wellness, as they stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters to build physical and physical resilience and resilience."

On the 24th, Shizuoka Prefecture commissioned two cycling teams in the eastern part of the prefecture to be "Fuji no Kuni Sports Supporters" who cooperate in the promotion of sports in the prefecture.

Hanshin Oyama, 2 rounds in a row No. 7!
Director Yano "Stately to watch" (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
(Central League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4-3, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of No. 4 is unstoppable.
The batted ball soared high and landed in the middle of the left-field seats.
Oyama hit his second consecutive arch and circled the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, his white teeth peeked out.
"I was able to get a good swing and I was able to squeeze the ball and swing as hard as I could."
Trailing 0-2 in the fourth inning, he came to bat leadoff the inning.
He swung aggressively from the first pitch and threw the second pitch after the foul.
I didn't miss Ohno's sweetly loaded 134-kilogram slider.
The batted ball caught with the core is such a perfect hit that you are convinced that it is a stand-in the moment you hit it.
Following the match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day, the first two matches in a row were the catalyst for the counterattack.
It was also a valuable shot from an opponent who was not good at it.
When they faced Ohno at Koshien on the 17th, they scored four runs on nine hits.
However, as far as the Nagoya Dome is concerned, they have allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold in their past 12 games, and have been on a seven-game losing streak since August 23, 2013, with a draw in between.
Against such a difficult opponent, he scored for the first time in 23 innings at the Nagoya Dome (including a walkoff counted in one inning) with a spectacular single and did not let the game take its course.
Coach Yano also commented, "The ability to finish off sweet balls is at a high level, and it is stately to watch, and even if the timing of the shot is foul, there is an atmosphere. I think he's still going to hit the ball," he said, looking forward to more explosions.
He singled to right field in the first inning, extending his six-game hitting streak and three-game multi-hit streak.
He started the season as a starter, but his seven home runs and 16 RBIs are already a team-leading and No. 4 hitter.
We will continue to produce results for the sake of victory.

"Medical worker" infected for the first time in Nagano Prefecture A woman in her 40s at Suwa Red Cross Hospital to conduct PCR tests for all contacts (NBS Nagano Broadcasting) --Yahoo! News
It turns out that a woman in her 40s in Suwa City, Nagano Prefecture is infected with the new coronavirus.
This is the first time in the prefecture that a medical worker who is a staff member of the Suwa Red Cross Hospital has been infected.
The infection was confirmed in a woman in her 40s who is a medical worker in Suwa City.
The number of infected people in the prefecture has reached 87, the first time for medical workers.
According to the prefecture, the woman had a cough and phlegm on the 13th and visited three medical institutions after the 17th.

Macau Casino Supervision Authority Visits Implementation of Epidemic Prevention Measures at Casino Facilities ... Mandatory presentation of a new coronavirus negative certificate at the time of admission (Macau newspaper) --Yahoo! News
Approximately 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the COVID-19 epidemic, but have reopened since February 20 with strict epidemic prevention measures in place.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires operating companies to protect the health of employees and guests as much as possible when reopening, ensuring the distance between gaming (casino) tables, vacating adjacent seats for table games (for example, 3~4 people can be seated at one table at the same time at a baccarat table), Slot machines are also required to operate every single or second machine to reduce the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, have their temperature checked, and present a valid health code (generated by entering their most recent stay history, history of contact with Covid patients, symptoms such as fever or cough, and contact information) upon entry.
From 0:00 a.m. on July 15, the presentation of a negative certificate of the new coronavirus nucleic acid test (limited to those within the validity period issued by an authorized facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) has also been added to the condition.
The background to the new mandatory presentation of a negative certificate is the relaxation of border measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6 a.m. on the 15th (elimination of 14-day isolation quarantine, various conditions), and it will be a preventive measure accompanying this.
On July 18, the DICJ announced that in response to the change in admission conditions from July 15, Adriano Ho, the director general of the DICJ, inspected the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, and held a meeting with representatives of the security departments of the six casino operators, and reiterated their request to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing the admission of guests.
The DICJ said it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities, hold regular meetings with the operating company in accordance with the situation and assessment, and adjust epidemic prevention measures at casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau.
Hayashi Matsu, chief of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Health Bureau, accompanied the team on the inspection of the casino facilities, and instructed them on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and keep a safe distance between seats in electronic casino machines.
Due to the drastic decline in inbound passengers due to epidemic prevention measures including entry restrictions, casino sales for the period of January ~ June this year decreased by 77.4% from the same period last year to MOP33.72 billion Japan(about 451.9 billion yen).
Ale of light from Yuwaku Onsen Next month, instead of the Bonbori Festival, a message to medical professionals (Hokkoku Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
Due to the influence of the new coronavirus, the annual "Yuwaku Bonbori Festival" has been canceled at Yuwaku Onsen, and from August 1st, an initiative to light bonbori with messages of support for medical professionals will begin.
Approximately 350 pieces of paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country are pasted on the canvas to envelop the city of hot springs with the light of ale and deliver healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaki Kuiroha", which is modeled after Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It started in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, and every year a large number of anime fans from all over the country visit.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to October of the main festival, a bonbori is hung up and lit up on the stairs leading to the Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to the main bath.
This year, the festival was forced to be canceled due to the new coronavirus, but after a series of comments from local and national fans, such as "It's sad that there are no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku," the association came up with this project.
In order to help heal and recover from the world that is struggling due to the Corona disaster, we named it the "Recovery Campaign".
So far, about 50 students from the local Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Elementary School have been asked to write an illustrated message one by one, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
You can purchase a message form from the association's website, fill it out, put it in a return envelope and send it to the association, and you can receive a photo with the light on.
One set costs 6,000 yen, and applications will be accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches about 350.
The bonbori is scheduled to be lit until the end of November.
Shinichiro Yamashita (48), who has served as the chairman of the festival's executive committee since its inception, said, "When we read the message, we are encouraged by it, and we want to hold a grand festival next year, which will be the 10th anniversary."
For the campaign, we also prepared a newly drawn illustration of the character of Hanasaki Kuiroha and the Asanogawa Bridge.
From the 1st, a clear file with illustrations will be given to users of special accommodation plans at the ryokan of Yuwaku Onsen.
Core 4 "Moriyama Gaien" that supports Seibu is soul cooperation (East Sports Web) --Yahoo! News
Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gaien" showed their soul coordination and produced their second walk-off win of the season.
In the ninth inning of the 2-2 tie against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, the four players who were still in a slump and were far from their best showed their tenacity to win.
Genda led off the inning with a head-sliding slide to first base from a safety bunt.
Then, Mori, the No. 3 hitter who has been in the bottom of the batting average of 1.82 in his last six games, laid down a sacrifice bunt to load the bases with one out.
No. 4 Yamakawa was ruled out, and Tozaki, who replaced Mori at No. 5 on this day, smashed Masuda's direct ball and led to a 3-2 victory.
Tozaki said, "[Genda's safety] caught me off guard even when I was on the bench, and I thought I had to do something about it. Mr. Yamakawa told me to be aggressive before I went to first base, so I was able to get into it," he said, reflecting on the thoughts of the three people who created the flow of the walk-off.
Mori and Yamakawa, who were No. 1 and No. 2 in the '13 draft, Tozaki, who was No. 3 in '14, and Genda, who was No. 3 in '16, are the "core four" of outfielders that baseball team officials call "the heart of our team right now."
All of them have experience as captains during their amateur days, and their sense of responsibility is greater than others.
Tozaki, who took over the captaincy from Yamakawa when he was in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is a good talker, so he is the captain who leads the team with words, and on the other hand, I am not a good talker, so I left the conversation to the vice-captain, who is good at talking, and I was the type of person who stood behind me."
Coach Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? But then I thought, 'Okay, I can go.' Tomoya also had a great bunt. Tozaki also hit well."
All four of them are currently struggling with a batting average of 20% 4~5 minutes, but even if they can't hit, they support the team with their wisdom and how to win.

Statue of Masujiro Omura Conveying his achievements as an educator to the foundry [Yamaguchi]|Ube Nippo Konomachi Media Web
On the 23rd, a bronze statue of Omura Masujiro (1825~69), one of the ten masters of the Restoration, was unveiled in his birthplace, Yamaguchi City.
An unveiling ceremony was held in the front yard of the established Foundry Community Center, and local and government officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, Western scholar, and physician during the Bakumatsu Restoration.
After teaching at the Shogunate's Western research and educational institution, the Bansho Shosho, he opened a private school in Edo, Hatoido, where he taught Dutch studies, military science, and medicine.
After returning to Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at the Yamaguchi Meirinkan.

He stood by the globe and held a calligraphy in his hand, giving a lecture on orchidology.
The height of the statue with the pedestal is about 3 meters (1.55 meters), and it is said that it was made from the perspective of a disciple who was taking a lecture by Masujiro.
It was designed by Marie Takami, a 27-year-old local designer who is a descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko.
It was erected by the 150th anniversary of the death of Masujiro Omura (Chairman Satoshi Okamoto), which is based on the Foundry Residents' Association, by soliciting donations.
Approximately 12.8 million yen was collected from 1,104 people nationwide.
The cost of the project, including the installation of the name plate, is about 12 million yen.
The surplus donations will be used for the maintenance of the statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who has maintained high aspirations and made a great contribution as an educator, is the pride of Furusato, and he is a statue that will be the hope of the children of the region who will lead the future."
Mbappe, who was injured after being tackled viciously, leaves the venue on crutches (SPORT.es ) --Yahoo! News
Paris Saint-Germain won the title for the 13th time in two years after beating Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the final of the Coupe de France held at the Stade de France on the 24th local time.
PSG win the domestic double
Neymar's winning goal beats Saint-Etienne Neymar's goal in the first half proved to be the winner of PSG's domestic double after Ligue 1, but they are in a worrying situation ahead of the Champions League in August.
Kylian Mbappe, who started the same match, was injured after being viciously tackled by opposition CB Loic Perrin.
In the 30th minute of the first half, the young French star was knocked down with a pinched right ankle and his face contorted in pain.
The play led to a scuffle between the players of both teams.
Mbappe, who is believed to have sprained his right ankle, is unable to continue playing.
Perrin was shown a red card.
After the game, Mbappe left the stadium on crutches with his right leg immobilized.
PSG will face Lyon in the Coupe d'Au La League final at 4:10 a.m. Japan time on 1 August, but it is doubtless that Mbappe will not be available in this match.
He will have to wait for a medical report from the club, but he could miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Corona disaster "Closer to art" Online museum "HASARD" Konno (from Hachinohe) launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can experience art for free, whenever they want.
The lineup ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has won the hearts of users due to its convenience and novelty, and the new lifestyle caused by the coronavirus pandemic has further increased its level of attention.
Shinnosuke Konno, a representative from Hachinohe City who launched the site (26) = living in Tokyo = says, "I wanted to create a service where anyone can easily enjoy art.
One of the things that strikes you when you visit Azar is the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, including permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions, are open to the public, and the ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only the colors but also the texture of the brushes attract viewers.
There is no need for membership registration or admission fees, and it is characterized by the fact that there is no cost not only for the viewer but also for artists who want to hold a solo exhibition.
The way it is presented online also attracts attention.
Moving the picture is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Begins to Move Again," clouds, flowers, and meadows are digitally processed to make them move.
"I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to get in" (Konno), so you can feel like you are in a painting.
Mr. Konno's first encounter with art was when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was shocked by their power.
From the next day, the art class turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo to go to university, I started going to galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that there were many people who did not have many opportunities to come into contact with art from various perspectives, such as the lack of museums nearby, the fact that large exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working at an IT company, he spent about two months setting up a website where people could appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new coronavirus.
If anyone could see art in a free form whenever they wanted to.
Azar's aim was unexpectedly accepted by more people due to the Corona disaster.
Mr. Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation, saying that it enriches the imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to those in need.
I hope that by making art more accessible, we will become a better society."
The Simple Reason Why the Era of Chinese Quality Is Coming Away and the Age of Japan Quality Is Coming (Modern Business) - Yahoo! News
The pandemic has shifted values
Various predictions and discussions are being made about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, the July 8 article "In fact, 'manager' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan ... The cruel reality" and the July 4 article "In the 'post-corona' world, 'Japan's manufacturing industry is actually going to make a big comeback ... ! There is a possibility that the changes described in the following will occur.
[Photo] The identity of "Japan strength" that only Japan people do not know ... The Surprising Reality I Saw in Asia
In addition, on the mental front, the June 26 article "'Tips for complete combustion' for those who have become aware of the end of their lives due to Corona" and the June 10 article "Now that Corona is full of riots, let's review the utility of 'relying on God in times of hardship'" seems to be mainstream.
And what we can clearly see as a form in which these two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" are merged is a major trend from "Chinese quality to Japan quality."
For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it is infuriating, but there is no other article for the life of the person who bought it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic ... ... "Chinese quality" in such products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will want products of "Japan quality".
Of course, this trend is not unique to Japan.
This is evident from the fact that Western countries, which have fallen into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, have made "returns" one after another because of the terrible quality of "Chinese quality".
Safety and security rather than cheapness
In addition, products such as automobiles are also products whose defects can be fatal (death due to accidents).
No matter how much China and South Korea and other countries go on the offensive with the "cheap or bad" discount sales strategy, in the end they cannot compete with Japan products, and the situation described in the June 16 article "Will the world's automakers bow down to Toyota?" is due to the strong demand for "Japan quality" in automobile products.
And the pandemic has reminded us that many other products also need to be "safe and secure."
In addition, safety and security are important not only in "Japan quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japan quality in services such as logistics".
In some cases, such as the toilet paper fiasco, there are cases where production capacity is in place, but intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be reached.
Furthermore, as in the April 17 article "Who is the real culprit of the shortage of masks?: Don't forgive the Chinese Communist regime's thieves in the fireplace," we were keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important factor in "safety and security."
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for any country to prioritize its own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essential goods such as masks (medical equipment) and food within one's own country.
South Korea's newly infected people exceed 100 people for the first time in 115 days = the largest number of overseas inflows at 86 (Yonhap News) --Yahoo! News
SEOUL (Yonhap) -- South Korea's Central Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters announced on the 25th that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus as of 0:00 a.m. on this day increased by 113 from 0:00 a.m. on the previous day, bringing the total to 14,092.
It is the first time in 115 days that the number of new infections per day has exceeded 100 since April 1 (101).
In addition to the fact that 32 seafarers were found to be infected on a Russian vessel that entered the port of Busan, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.
The number of newly infected people in South Korea was in the 30~60 range, except for the 20th (26 people).
Of the new infections announced on the 25th, 86 people entered the country from overseas, the highest number since January 20, when the first infection occurred in South Korea.
Iraq had the highest number of arrivals with 36, followed by Russia (34), the Philippines (5) and the United States (3).
On the other hand, there were 27 community-acquired infections, with 11 each in Seoul and Gyeongui-do, and 5 in Busan.
The five people in Busan were employees of a repair company aboard a Russian vessel.
The death toll remains unchanged from the previous day, bringing the total to 298.
Nagoya's Miyahara tests positive for corona Soccer J1, the first time since the resumption of the league|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
Nagoya of the J1 soccer team announced on the 25th that defender MIYAHARA Kazuya (24) has tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first time a player has tested positive since the resumption of the J.League.
He is the third player from the club to do so, following forward Yume Kanasaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31), who were infected in June.
The two have already received treatment and have returned to the game.
This season, Miyahara was on the bench for the J1 match against Oita at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th and revealed that 60 players and staff members had undergone PCR tests on the same day.
98% reflective.
It turns out that the white paint derived from the Teflon-coated frying pan improves the cooling effect by insulating it!
A great discovery!
This year's rainy season was marked by an unusually high amount of precipitation, but the scorching heat of summer will be in full swing after dawn.
It's hot, it's hot, and it's so hot that even the air conditioning doesn't work ... Just imagining it makes you swoon, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been trying to figure out how to get through the hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear light white clothing.
You see, you don't have to go out of your way to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer, right?
And it seems that the same principle is applied to the construction of houses, and the use of white paint is increasing.
Whether white can be made into a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat was also the latest research field.
Recently, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) announced that it has collaborated with researchers in Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics to find the most efficient way to repel solar heat and improve the cooling effect of building interiors.
It is said that the aim is to put it to practical use as soon as possible.
Until now, white paint, which has the highest reflectivity of the sun's rays, has been made of titanium dioxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paints using titanium dioxide are already being applied to roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, helping to block solar heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluororesin, which is used in Teflon-coated frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect, and it is said that it can reflect the sun's rays to nearly 98% and significantly cut heat.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the intense heat ~.
Such an era may be just around the corner, isn't it?
I feel that the roofs of houses in Japan are often dark colors, but in the future, white will become the mainstream.
Amazon's annual big sale, when is it happening this year?
Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual big sale "Prime Day," CNBC reported on July 21.
It is held every year in July, but this year it was reported that it had to be postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
A spokesperson said, "More details coming soon," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration that we've been looking forward to for the past five years, and this year we're holding it later than usual while keeping our employees safe and supporting our customers and sellers."
However, he only stated that "details will be announced soon" and did not disclose the specific date.
On the other hand, it was decided to hold the event in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it will be implemented for 48 hours from 0:00 a.m. on August 6.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world in the past, but this year it may be taking an unusual step.
■ A large-scale event that sold 760 billion yen in two days Amazon launched this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure during the summer when sales are declining.
Initially a 24-hour event, it has expanded over the years, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15 in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia.
According to the company, last year's two-day sales exceeded those of Black Friday (the first day of the year-end shopping season) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
The event has also helped attract new Prime subscribers, with last year seeing a record number of applications on the first day of the event, followed by the next day.
Last year, the company sold 175 million products worldwide.
Regarding this, Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that the total global sales value for the two days was 7.16 billion dollars (about 760 billion yen), up 70% from the previous year.
Mobile number porting, strict eyes on excessive retention.
What about fees and points?
(New Switch) --Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is in full swing considering a review of the Number Forwarding System (MNP), which allows users to use their existing phone numbers as they are when changing mobile carriers.
At the meeting of experts on the 21st, the government announced a policy to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
There are a wide range of specific issues, such as the nature of MNP fees and the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
While a backlash from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
The darkness of telecommunications companies that are far from unlimited mobile phone switching When MNP was first introduced in 06, the user burden fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee income of the three major mobile telecommunications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the "Working Group (WG) on the Verification of Competition Rules," a panel of experts that discusses the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time for issuing MNP reservation numbers, which are required for consumers to move to other telecommunications companies, was also cited as a key factor.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications on the web, but due to the convenience of operating their core systems, the reception hours are mainly from 9 to 20 o'clock.
In the WG document, it was clearly stated that the direction of future consideration would be an all-day response in principle.
It is also a problem that mobile carriers try to retain people who wish to move out with MNP by awarding points.
This is based on the judgment that excessive retention may impede fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, said, "It is important to thoroughly implement this process first, as we will give users time to explain the provision of economic benefits or obtain permission from users, and for those who do not give permission, we will promptly issue a number and terminate it."
However, among the series of issues, there is a structural problem with MNP fees: "The higher the fee, the more difficult it is for customers to leave the company, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (a person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If some businesses take the initiative to lower MNP fees, there is a concern that the outflow of customers from the company will increase, and the company's efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will be the case in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications intends to compile a report on the results of the WG around September-October, after which it will begin the process of revising the MNP Guidelines.
The timing of the revision is expected to be after 21.
Mobile carriers are likely to have a headache when it comes to sales and customer support.
Chunichi Katsuno, 6 scoreless innings but not the right to win (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Masayoshi Katsuno (23) started the 8th inning of the Hanshin game (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He allowed four hits and no runs in six innings.
"I thought it was my last chance because I pitched last time, and I had some foreballs, but I didn't worry too much about it and I was able to compete with them."
In his first start of the season and the previous game against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, he struggled with the ball in both starts and was removed by the fourth inning.
He didn't play his role as a starter, and this time he was on the mound in a backwater where he was fighting for his survival.
This time, against the in-form Tiger batting lineup, they attacked with a heartfelt ball.
When he threw a fastball in the high 140 kph range, he was able to use his changeup effectively, including a count ball.
In the sixth, Suns led off with a double to left-center, but got Oyama to fly out to left and Bohr to double out to third with two outs.
In the match against Fukudome, he drove in two pitches and finished with a fork.
He struck out the side on three pitches to end the inning.
Katsuno was 83 pitches after six innings, but as soon as the game was over, Yoda came off the bench and announced a pitching change.
In a pitcher's duel, Seiyu was 108 pitches at the same point, but he left the mound early and was unable to earn his first win of the season.

The Masuda Shrine, located in the Takakushi district of Tano, Hizen Town, Karatsu City, is dedicated to Officer Keitaro Masuda (1869~95), who was martyred in his efforts to combat cholera, an epidemic that spread to the region 125 years ago.
The annual festival has been held in late July every year, but this year it was canceled due to the influence of the new coronavirus.
On the 26th, only Shinto ceremonies will be held by the local government presidents.
The annual grand festival was held by the residents' association, and there was a parade of floats and fireworks by Officer Masuda riding a white horse.
Nearly 200 people, including bereaved family members living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officials, and local residents, attend the ceremony every year.
This year, the coronavirus pandemic has led to an increase in media inquiries for interviews, and Yoshinori Takeda (72), the chairman of the local government, said, "It is a festival that is connected to the community, and it is crowded every year, and it is very unfortunate that it has been canceled."
The prefectural police also canceled the memorial service for police academy students this year.
On the 21st, Chief Yumiko Sugiuchi and Karatsu Chief Hiroto Fukushima visited Komatsujima Island off the coast of Takakushi Port, which was attached to the monument, and laid flowers at the monument.
Chief Sugiuchi reaffirmed his belief that "the spirit of courage and dedication is the starting point of the police, and I would like to continue it as it should be."
Officer Masuda, a native of Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takakushi in July 1895 (Meiji 28).
He took measures such as disinfecting patients' homes without sleep, and subsequently became infected with cholera himself.
"I'm going to carry all the cholera on my back," he said, dying at the age of 25 just four days after his arrival.

Akio Kinoshita, Director of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explained dry eyes, etc. "Hotto Seminar" = Yonezawa Saga Main Store of Glasses in Saga City
On the 25th, the "Health Relief Seminar" (sponsored by Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa of Glasses) was held at the Yonezawa Saga Main Store of Glasses in Shimoda-cho, Saga City.
Dr. Akio Kinoshita, Director of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Kogi City), explained about eye diseases that are deeply involved in daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "tear disease" and is a disease in which the quality of tears is disrupted and tears are not evenly distributed to the surface of the eye.
Mr. Kinoshita said, "Contact lens users are about four times more likely to be affected," and warned that "do not use them for long periods of time or sleep with them on."
Measures such as placing the computer screen below eye level and humidifying in air-conditioned rooms were demonstrated.
Ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"Omega-3, which is contained in blue fish, prevents the evaporation of tears, and 'mucin,' which is abundant in natto and okra, improves the quality of tears."
Regarding cataract surgery, he touched on the difference in the way we see the intraocular lenses that are inserted instead of the crystalline lens, both monofocal and multifocal.
About 40 people attended the seminar.
As a measure to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the event was held in two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with a small number of people, and temperature measurement and disinfection before entering the venue, as well as sufficient ventilation of the venue.

【G Osaka】17-year-old forward Karayama likely to make his J1 debut against Kobe?
Coach Miyamoto "Scoring ability is outstanding" ( Sports Hochi ) --Yahoo! News
G Osaka's coach Tsuneyasu Miyamoto (43) spoke to the media ahead of the match against Kobe (Noesta on 26 September) on the 25th, and revealed his expectations for the 17-year-old high school third-year forward Karayama Shoji, who was named in the first team for the first time in the previous match.
The coach will make Karayama, who was promoted to the top of the team this season, a bench member for the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
The striker, who was not given a chance to play but has scored three goals in five games in J3 so far this season, said: "There is something that stands out in terms of scoring goals. I've seen players go abroad at a young age, but I want them to play with a high level of awareness and a lot of desire."
Karayama scored eight goals in 10 games for J3 last season as a specially designated player.
Although he is slender at 178 cm and 65 kg, he has a staggering scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3 with his sense of getting behind defenders with his instantaneous movement and his composure before shooting in front of the dense opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, forward Ademiuson and midfielder Onose were off the bench due to injuries, and Karayama got a chance, but he did not get a chance to play.
Ahead of the match against Kobe, Coach Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiuson and Onose, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are highly motivated and ready to take on the challenge."
If the two of them are to be saved, there is a possibility that Tangshan will be on the bench again.
At G Osaka, midfielder Doyasu = current PSV = made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, and forward Usami made his J1 debut at the age of 17 years and 0 months, and moved overseas as a teenager.
Tangshan, who is currently 17 years and 10 months old, is expected to make his J1 debut as a follow-up to them.
Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of the river │ To work without restoration (octane.jp ) --Yahoo! News
In 1994, a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
Time passed without the police being able to solve the problem, but after 26 years, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (4 photos) The discovery was triggered by diving training at the fire department.
On 8 July, a diver in training spotted something wedge-shaped at the bottom of the river, and the police, even the Dutch military, were dispatched to pull it up, and it turned out to be a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number against a database of stolen cars, the Ferrari was able to be linked to the 1994 incident.
The car is handed over to its legal owner, the insurance company, and then sent to a scrap dealer.
Scrappers Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said: "There are still a few parts left, but they are for the art of decorating, and we have already received many requests from people who want to make tables out of dismembered mondials. We use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, they are not thinking of selling it specifically, and it will be stored by scrap dealers as an object.
Seibu and Sotozaki hit their first walk-off hit.
The 6th year professional "man who doesn't have" is finally here!
(Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
(Pacific League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu 6-3, 24th, MetLife)
Seibu infielder Shuta Tozaki (27) hit his first walk-off single in his sixth year as a professional to left field in the ninth inning of the ninth inning of the Lotte 9th inning (MetLife) on the 24th, helping the team to a 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunities created by Genda's head-sliding and Mori's sacrifices.
The team that won the bid together had 2 saves.
The Leo Party's voltage at the MetLife Dome was at its peak.
Tozaki hit his first walk-off hit in his sixth year as a professional.
The crowd of 4,825 was excited.
"Genda and Tomoya (Mori) connected with me, so I went into the at-bat with the intention of doing something about it." His teammates' tenacity to win inspired the number 5.
The game was tied 2-2 in the ninth inning.
Genda, the leadoff hitter, attempted a safety bunt and slid headfirst into first base.
After reaching base on an infield hit, Mori, last season's leadoff hitter, scored on his second professional hit.
No. 4, Yamakawa, does not declare.
A senior from Fuji University was forced to walk, and Sotozaki's heart was on fire.
"I was like, 'Damn,' and before I went to first base, he told me, 'Be aggressive,' so I was really excited."
From the first ball, he jammed a straight ball with a high inside angle, but the batted ball fell to the left front.
Throughout his amateur days, he said he had no memory.
The 27-year-old, who was inspired by his alma mater, Aomori's Hirosaki Minoru High School, advanced to the top four of the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a jubilant water shower and smiled, saying, "As expected, it felt good."
He was called "the man who doesn't have it."
He was selected by Samurai Japan as an all-around player who can defend the infield and outfield, and helped the team win the Premier12 in November last year.
However, he had no experience with walk-off hitting at Seibu, and was teased by Coach Tsuji and the Baba strategy and defensive and running base coaches, saying, "You don't have it, you."
He bounced back from a negative reputation and produced his second walk-off win of the season.
Coach Tsuji praised, "I asked the Goddess of Victory to do it today, and she batted well."
With two savings, they are in third place, one game behind the leader SoftBank.
Tozaki, who has only hit one home run this season and has a .252 batting average, said, "I still have to hit, and we will work together as a team to win the next one."
The shot that decided the game will be used as an opportunity to recover.

Steady steps toward brand pig Minoru pig farming, JGAP acquisition (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
Minoru Pig Farming, which raises about 50,000 pigs a year at farms in Towada City and Roknohe Town (Representative Wataru Nakano), visited Mayor Hisashi Oyamada at Towada City Hall on the 20th and reported that its farm had obtained JGAP (Livestock and Livestock Products) certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second pig farming business in the prefecture to acquire this certification.
The company is involved in the production of "garlic pork," which uses powdered garlic from the prefecture as a special feed, and "jitoon," which uses rice produced in the prefecture.
This time, out of the five farms, the fifth farm (Roknohe Town), which raises about 10,000 pigs and produces "local pigs," has obtained JGAP certification.
The company sought to obtain certification because it thought that "certification is necessary to be selected by major buyers" and learned that it was a condition for the procurement of ingredients to be used in the Olympic Village for the Tokyo Olympics.
With the support of Aomori Bank since August last year, preparations have been carried out together with bank staff who are qualified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3 of this year, it was examined by a certification body and cleared a total of 113 standards, including food safety.
The certification was obtained on the 13th of the same month.
The visit was attended by Wataru Nakano, President of Aomori Bank, Wataru Nakano, Managing Director of the company, Takeo Yamada, General Manager of the Towada Minami Branch of Aomori Bank, and Nobuhiro Ishigo, Business Advisor of the Bank's Corporate Support Department.
Mayor Oyamada said, "It is very wonderful, and I hope that (JGAP certification) will be greatly promoted and will lead to the expansion of sales channels."
Representative Watatoshi Nakano expressed his enthusiasm, saying, "I would like to continue to contribute to Towada City by making efforts to brand pig farming."
Managing Director Wataru Nakano said, "We aim to obtain certification for the remaining four farms."

Heavy rain, scars on "traffic" in Hokuen National Route 152 10 km road closed, JR Iida Line partially closed | Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
National Highway 152 is completely closed, and a line of cars waiting for a one-way alternating detour = 22nd afternoon, Ryusan Town, Tenryu Ward, Hamamatsu City (part of the photo has been processed)
The torrential rains in July caused enormous damage to Kyushu and other parts of Japan, and the Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was severely damaged in Shizuoka Prefecture.
The effects of landslides remain on National Route 152, the main road, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "foot of life," and there are many places where it takes time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are increasingly concerned about the negative impact on economic activities.
At the Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in Yongsan Town, the same ward, a long line of cars waiting for traffic continues during the day.
The lead car remained at a standstill for nearly 40 minutes.
National Highway 152 is completely closed for about 10 kilometers, and it is necessary to take a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River to move around the town.
However, the road is narrow, the entire section is one-way alternating traffic, and the waiting time is unpredictable.
In the same town, a landslide occurred on the national highway on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on the nearby slopes.
On the 13th, a crack was found in the Akiba Tunnel in the restricted section, and there is no time limit for the resumption of traffic.
In 2018, a national highway was closed due to a landslide in the same town, which affected residents' lives and tourism.
Kimie Tamamoto, a 76-year-old representative of the Dragon Mama processing plant, which sells specialty products, said, "We are caught up with the new coronavirus and the number of customers has decreased significantly."
The JR Iida Line was suspended between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, Nagano Prefecture) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse beside the tracks.
Shiori Ukai (16), who commuted from Oarashi Station (in the same town) to the Hamamatsuko Kita High School Sakuma Branch School in Sakuma Town, the same ward, needed a car pick-up and drop-off for about an hour each way.
"A car is a heavy burden for both parents and myself," he said, hoping for a speedy recovery.
According to JR Central, it is expected to take about three months to resume, and from the 27th, a special train will be operated between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station on weekday mornings and evenings.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides often occur on forest roads that are also local roads.
In some cases, the detour takes several hours.
Keiji Kumagai, 69, president of the Mizukubo Town Forestry Association, said, "The removal of logs has been delayed, and there are isolated islands everywhere. I'm worried about the rain in the future."
Shoya Nakajima, is it his choice not to attend the victory ceremony?
Local media report (Football Channel) --Yahoo! News
Japan midfielder Shoya Nakajima seems to be on his way to leaving Porto.
Portugal's ZAP reported based on information from Rekord.
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019/20 season, held a victory ceremony on the pitch during their final home match on the 20th of this month.
However, the fact that Nakajima was not present in this place was also a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team for training during the league suspension due to the new coronavirus, has been absent since then.
In such a situation, he was not even present at the championship ceremony, and there is talk of a transfer this summer.
According to Record, Porto had invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
It's just that Nakajima didn't show up.
As a result, "Nakajima is increasingly out of Sergio Conceição's plans for next season and will need to leave the club in the next transfer window."
Nakajima wore the number 10 shirt at a prestigious club in Portugal, but it seems that he will leave the club after one year.

45% of households have a wife holding the purse!
Is my husband happy? Unhappiness?
"I don't have enough pocket money this month ... Isn't there a wife who is shocked or angry when her husband tells her?
The family in which this conversation takes place is one in which the wife holds the purse.
How many families in the world have a wife holding the purse?
Also, let's take a look at the percentage of "separate wallets for married couples" and "jointly managed" together.
Who owns the household purse?
The following survey results were obtained from the results of the "Survey on the Household Management Situation of Married Couples" (announced in June Reiwa 2), which was conducted by Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. nationwide on an online survey of 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples) who have been married for less than 3 years, and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (middle-aged couples) who have been married for more than 30 years.
Who holds the household wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The largest number of households were those in which the wife manages the household finances.
No matter which one is managed, there are twists and turns in household budget management, but it seems that there are various episodes.
Wife manages the household finances: In the case of Ako Ako is a working mom of Alafif who has a daughter who is in her third year of high school and a daughter who is in her first year of high school.
Ms. Ako is in full control of the household finances.
Ahead of the university entrance exam, the cram school fee was increasing and there were many months when the deficit appeared, so I negotiated with my husband to lower my pocket money, but as expected, he resisted.
At that time, I was told to show me what kind of income and expenditure I had, so I showed him my household account book.
I should have listed all my expenses, but when I looked at the household account book, it was not enough to make a loss.
I was about to lean on my husband, saying, "It's enough," but Mr. Ako involuntarily said, "I understand, I'm not good enough at managing the household budget, so please manage everything."
Later, when Ms. Ako interviewed her husband, he said, "Although I am dissatisfied with the management of my pocket money, the truth is that I do not have the time or energy to manage various inputs and withdrawals of household expenses (for example, school teaching materials, PTA fees, etc.)."
Husband manages the household budget: In the case of Child B Child B, a full-time housewife, is given living expenses by her husband and manages every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to buy a replacement, saying, "The freezer is no good, but the refrigerated part can still be used, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, it seems that the husband himself wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time, and he turned his palm inside out, saying, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
So Mr. B involuntarily complained to his friend, "My husband is so stingy that I can get a do."
Takefusa Kubo's transfer destination narrowed down to 5 clubs in the Spanish First Division (East Sports Web) --Yahoo! News
This season, Japan midfielder Takefusa Kubo (19), who played for Mallorca in the Spanish First Division, seems to be gradually narrowing down the transfer destination.
Mallorca were relegated to the second division, but Kubo's reputation skyrocketed due to his performances at the end of the season.
However, it is difficult for him to return to Real Madrid, the first division club where he has "ownership" rights due to the non-EU quota, and he plans to play for another club next season.
He has already received offers from around 30 clubs, but Real Madrid are planning to train him at a domestic club.
Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis are the most likely destinations for Kubo, with "five clubs interested in signing him, but Real Madrid want a club that is at least mid-level in the league."
Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad will qualify for next season's Europa League (EL), while Granada will also participate in the second round of the EL qualifiers, meeting the team requirements of Real Madrid.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make on the departure of "Japan's crown jewel"?

Karamon illuminated by colorful fireworks and lights launched at a nationwide event = Ichijoya Asakura ruins in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture on the night of July 24
On the night of July 24, less than a year before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus, the Junior Chamber of Japan (JC) held a nationwide fireworks event to brighten up society as much as possible.
Unfortunately, the weather in Fukui Prefecture was rainy and unfortunate, but the launch was carried out as scheduled at nine locations, coloring the summer night sky.
In the hope that it would be a signal to overcome the sense of stagnation caused by the spread of infection and to reinvent Japan, JC called on each block council nationwide to realize it.
It started at 8 p.m. at 117 locations in 46 prefectures.
At the ruins of the Asakura clan in Fukui City, a total of 53 rounds of No. 2~4 balls were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with haze.
The light of the fireworks made the Karamon gate stand out in the dark night, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
In the prefecture, it was also held on the Matsubara coast in Tsuruga City and along the Mana River in Ono City.
In order to prevent infection, the launch site was not announced in advance in order to avoid a large number of onlookers.
