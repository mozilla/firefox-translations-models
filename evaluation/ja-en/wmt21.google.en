Honoka has [Minami Tanaka style hair]!
Full report on the cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add layers to heavy semi-length hair for [Minami style] fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka tries out a hairstyle with movement like Minami Tanaka, whom she admires, saying, ``She&#39;s not only beautiful, but she&#39;s also extremely professional and I respect her!&#39;&#39;
I asked Teru Asahiko of the hair salon &quot;SUNVALLY&quot; in Omotesando, who actually cuts Minami Tanaka&#39;s hair, to give her a &quot;Minami-style&quot; haircut.
I will report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Mizuki Yamashita appears on the cover for the first time with short hair!
First, check out Honoka&#39;s hair before the cut.
Thin, soft, and voluminous.
It has a curly curl and gets frizzy, especially during the rainy season, so I sometimes get a straight perm.
Heavy semi-long hair with flowing bangs.
It&#39;s time to start cutting!
Lightly wet the entire piece first to make it easier to cut.
After that, set aside the upper part of the head (above the most protruding part of the head) and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are some tips on how to get your hair closer to Minami&#39;s!
1 Double bangs By making the inside of your bangs a little shorter, you can enjoy different variations depending on your styling, such as slightly thicker bangs when worn fully down, or see-through when lightly parted.
2 Cuts that take advantage of curly hair If you have curly hair, if you reduce the amount of hair too much, it may spread out even more.
While consulting about the balance, we maintain a balance that is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and that allows your own undulations to shine through.
3 Layers around the face and loose hair Layers = A cut that is cut in steps.
Adding layers around your face will give it more movement and create a cute finish.
By creating loose hair in three places: at the temples, and in front and behind the sideburns, you can look stylish even when you put your hair up in a quick bun.
Cut the hair above the bee that you have separated, and then cut it around the face.
Pull out the upper part of the hair around your face and snip the ends.
By doing this, when you let your hair down, there will be a difference in the hair, making it easier to move (this is a layered cut).

● Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte ○ &lt;10th round, MetLife Dome&gt; Lotte&#39;s starting pitcher, Atsuki Taneichi, threw 136 pitches in 9 innings by himself, resulting in his happy first shutout in his fourth year as a professional.
This was the first shutout in the Pacific League this season, resulting in the team&#39;s third win and ending the team&#39;s losing streak at just two.
In the first inning, Taneichi allowed Shohei Suzuki, the leadoff hitter, to get on base with a double that broke through the third base line, but right after that, Sosuke Genda grounded out from third base, and during this time, Masahiro Suzuki, who was trying to advance, was also touched out at third base.
Helped by the calm response of his defensive teammates, he got through the initial crisis with zero, and from the second inning onwards, he toyed with Seibu&#39;s batting lineup with a combination of sliders and forks centered around his proud straight.
He gradually got better and started putting zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line was unable to hit the opposing starter, Keisuke Honda, but at the beginning of the 7th inning, No. 3 Tsuyoshi Kanno walked on base, and pinch runner Hiromi Oka succeeded in stealing second base.
Taking advantage of this chance, No. 4 Naonori Yasuda hits a powerful right-field hit, finally breaking the deadlock.
Then, in the 8th inning, he attacked Tetsu Miyagawa, the opponent&#39;s No. 3, and scored 4 points, including a two-point hit between left and center, which was Takashi Toritani&#39;s first timely hit since his transfer.
He encouraged the Marines&#39; young ace candidate and quickly decided the match.
Taneichi finished the 8th inning by forcing all three batters out, and continued pitching in the 9th inning, when he pitched over 100 pitches.
``I put all my energy into it,&#39;&#39; he said, as he continued to walk and put the bases loaded with two outs, but in the end, he got his 10th strikeout of the day with a high fastball from Spangenberg, and the game was set.
I smiled and savored my joy.
Tsuruoka Police Station bids farewell to accidents with new strategy to raise safety awareness in collaboration with related organizations | Yamagata Shimbun
At the bicycle class held as the starting event for the operation, a collision experiment between a car and a bicycle was conducted. - Shoko Gakuen Driving School, Tsuruoka City
The Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Keizo Sato) has launched the ``Bye-Bye Accident Zero Strategy&#39;&#39; in an effort to eliminate the high percentage of accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles that occur within its jurisdiction in recent years.
In addition to working with local traffic safety organizations to promote awareness of accident prevention, the city will also step up efforts to crack down on bicycle traffic rule violations.
This year, there have been three fatal traffic accidents within the police station&#39;s jurisdiction, resulting in the deaths of motorcyclists and cyclists.
Although the number of accidents is on the decline, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is approximately 11.7% as of June 30th, and the percentage of accidents involving motorcycles is approximately 5.8%, both of which are higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the rate of bicycle accidents in the past five years has exceeded the prefectural average in many years, and a strategy was planned to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation combines the words &quot;bike&quot; and &quot;bicycle&quot; with the meaning of eradicating accidents.
Related organizations will be encouraged more than ever to provide driving guidance to the elderly and to use reflective materials at night, through traffic safety classes and other activities.
The police department issues yellow cards (guidance warning slips) and urges caution when crackdowns occur.
The opening ceremony for the operation was held on the 21st at Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City.
Approximately 30 people involved were in attendance, and Chief Sato said in his greeting, ``I would like to ask for your cooperation in reducing the number of tragic accidents.&#39;&#39;
Officials from the police department explained the policy and activities of each group.
A bicycle class was subsequently held as a starting event for the strategy.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle changes depending on whether the bicycle is hit by applying the brakes or not and the car is traveling at approximately 55km/h without applying the brakes.
Koichi Kanauchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activities Promotion Committee, said, ``This made me realize once again the horror of traffic accidents.I would like to appeal to young people as well as the elderly to be careful.&#39;&#39;

Butler once again praises Tyler Herro, the young star who holds the future of the Heat, ``He doesn&#39;t think like a rookie&#39;&#39; (Basket Count) - Yahoo! News
Photo = Getty Images The Heat&#39;s first scrimmage (practice game) is against the Kings.
In this game, which they easily won 104-98, the backcourt was active with Duncan Robinson scoring a team-high 18 points, followed by Tyler Herro with 15 points.
In addition to Robinson, who is one of the best shooters in the league, the step up of Herro, a rookie who was drafted 13th overall, will be an important factor for the Heat.
Herro missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season entered a long hiatus after his return game against the Hornets on March 12.
Herro said, ``I had plenty of time, so I was able to get back to 100% condition. It&#39;s the best feeling I&#39;ve ever felt,&#39;&#39; but his performance at the scrimmage was more convincing than words. .
Herro&#39;s playing time increased due to the delay in starting point guard Kendrick Nunn joining the team, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
He played a different role than usual and scored 15 points, so he has great value.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his ``favourite&#39;&#39; Herro.
&quot;He&#39;s a good handler, he can score, he can play defense. He&#39;s a player who can do everything for the team. He can play any position because he doesn&#39;t think like a rookie. I keep in mind where and how my teammates move and get free, and what I should do in response.&quot;
Even before this season started, Butler was impressed with Herro&#39;s competitive spirit, which is uncharacteristic of a rookie, and his stoic approach to basketball.
That&#39;s why I invited him to his individual practice sessions starting at 4 a.m., and we trained together.
Butler once said, ``He tells everyone his opinion and doesn&#39;t back down. I respect that kind of fighting spirit.&#39;&#39;
Butler is the type of person who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will benefit the team, he will voice his harsh opinions even though he knows it will cause a conflict.
This has caused his relationships with teammates to deteriorate in the past.
Butler probably sees a lot of his younger self in Herro.
Butler&#39;s personality, which can be harsh at times for his teammates, is a good guide for those with the guts to keep up.
If this mentor-student relationship of mutual respect spreads throughout the team, the Heat should be able to become a team that can aim even higher.

It was No. 4, a second-year player who was making his first appearance this summer, who foiled his opponent&#39;s efforts.
With no outs and bases loaded in the first inning, Shimada Commercial&#39;s Matsuura hit a breaking ball and sent it to the front left.
``For three years, if I lost, I would immediately retire.I wanted to make sure I hit the ball and let them win.&#39;&#39;

Saito, who pitched in consecutive innings, showed the determination of his third year, as he pitched well, limiting the batter to one hit in the sixth inning, and did not let anyone step on second base.
The No. 10 player said, ``Having the second year students there will also inspire the third year students. I hope it leads to victory.&#39;&#39; It has been positively received as a synergistic effect.
The team, which is aiming to make it to the top four for the third consecutive year including the Shizuoka tournament up until last year, has no intention of making memories in the remaining games.

We want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka, and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians connected to Fukushima prefecture came together to create a message song.
The lyrics depict Fukushima Prefecture&#39;s dedicated efforts in fighting the new coronavirus, as they work towards recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident.
We hope to include singing voices from prefectural residents and complete the ``complete version&#39;&#39; by next summer, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video posting site YouTube.
The song title is &quot;Pray from Fukushima.&quot;
The positive attitude of the people is expressed in a bright and cheerful melody that expresses the desire to convey the message from Fukushima.
Due to the effects of the new coronavirus, live music venues that serve as bases for music activities have been forced to close, leaving many musicians without a place to sing or perform.
Singer-songwriter nappo (46), a resident of Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O of the Iwaki City music group &quot;Mexicali Boys&quot; are trying to believe in the power of music at a time when the future is uncertain. (37) planned it.
Mr. Nappo will be in charge of writing the lyrics and composing the song, and Mr. DAZUO will be in charge of the rapping.
When the project started in March during the coronavirus pandemic, singer-songwriters MANAMI (28) from Fukushima City, Jun Kanno (38) and others agreed one after another, and the circle quickly expanded.
Nappo said with a look of emotion on his face, ``The lineup turned out to be unimaginable in normal times.I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest.&#39;&#39;
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, there was no opportunity for the 16 people to gather together, and each recorded at a live music venue or home.
To support the project, Koa-san, an artist from Iwaki City, drew a new image character.
It is modeled after Fukushima Prefecture and uses blue and green colors to express its rich natural climate.
The goal is to broadcast the completed song to the world on YouTube, and to make it into a CD.
Next year will mark 10 years since the earthquake, and the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are also scheduled to be held.
DAZU-O said, ``We who have overcome hardships have a huge burden on our shoulders. I hope that by releasing the song at this milestone, it will encourage many people.&#39;&#39;

Instantly detects crisis outbreaks from internet information and identifies false rumors (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
“I want to know as soon as possible where and what disasters and accidents occur!”
This is a strong need not only for news organizations such as television and newspapers, but also for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
The service that meets this demand is ``Spectee,&#39;&#39; developed by Spectee, which handles information analysis using AI.
[Photo] A specialized team determines the authenticity of social media information based on alerts from Spectee.
Nowadays, the way people first learn about disasters and accidents is starting to shift from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to constantly monitor the overflowing information and extract useful information from it manually.
Spectee has the ability to detect information related to natural disasters and accidents from the information flowing on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyze the content, determine the authenticity of the information, and then distribute it to the companies that use it.
&quot;We broadly define events that have a negative impact that halt or stagnate social activities as &#39;crises&#39;&quot; (Kenjiro Murakami, Representative Director and CEO), a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas. is.
NHK&#39;s first major use of Spectee was during the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April 2016, and the adoption of Spectee has since spread rapidly among companies.
More than 350 companies in Japan are currently using Spectee, including not only news organizations such as television stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local governments across the country.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of the “crisis”
Spectee distributes information through four steps: ``information collection,&#39;&#39; ``analysis and content classification,&#39;&#39; ``title assignment,&#39;&#39; and ``authenticity determination.&#39;&#39;
User companies specify in advance the region (prefecture, city, ward, town, village, etc.) and crisis category (disaster, accident, etc.) for which information will be collected.
Spectee collects posts that meet the specifications using APIs provided by social media.
It then analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if a video is posted that shows a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames coming from a room, it would be classified as a ``fire.&#39;&#39;
In addition, an image of an overturned car is classified as a ``traffic accident,&#39;&#39; and an image of a road covered with water is classified as ``road flooding.&#39;&#39;
Spectee also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
``In many cases, we cannot tell the location from the post, so we estimate it by combining various information,&#39;&#39; CEO Murakami said.
For example, if a road sign or billboard appears in an image or video, place name information is extracted from it and compared with a place name database to identify the location.

&quot;Zurukomi&quot; and &quot;uchinchi&quot; don&#39;t make sense... ...?
We asked Chiba residents, &quot;Words I thought weren&#39;t really dialects&quot; (Netorabo) - Yahoo! News
I am a citizen of Chiba prefecture, which is close to Tokyo.
I have lived in the same prefecture for about 30 years since I was born.
When I used the phrase ``Zurukomi&#39;&#39;, which means ``entering in&#39;&#39;, in a conversation with a friend from university (Tokyo), I was instantly taken aback.
Although the meaning was understood by the flow and the sound of the words, the people of Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture told me not to use it.
― ― Is it true that “Zurukomi → cheating and sneaking in?”
Since it seems to be connected, I can guess the meaning somehow.
And one more thing.
I didn&#39;t realize this because it was pointed out to me, but the expression ``uchinchi&#39;&#39;, which means ``my house,&#39;&#39; is never used in books, and I haven&#39;t heard it from my friends either. When I looked it up as an adult, I discovered that it was a dialect.
― ― Huh, “Uchinchi”... ... Is that so?
I use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn&#39;t notice it because I stopped using it naturally after I became an adult.
Japanese &quot;hiyashi chuka&quot; doesn&#39;t appeal to Chinese people...?
Why &quot;cold noodle dishes&quot; are unpopular (Modern Business) - Yahoo! News
In China, hiyashi chuka is called &quot;Japanese-style cold noodles&quot;
As mentioned at the beginning, hiyashi chuka is a Chinese dish that originated in Japan (Japanese-style Chinese cuisine), and was devised based on the Chinese ``liang ban mien&#39;&#39; (chilled mixed noodles).
Therefore, although it does not originally exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it has started to appear in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, arranged products such as ``Japanese-style soba liangmian/soba hiyashi chuka&#39;&#39; and ``chuanxiang chicken liangmian/Sichuan-style chicken hiyashi chuka&#39;&#39; have also appeared at Japanese convenience stores.
On the other hand, Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is generally not very popular in China, overwhelmed by trendy and punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the flavors of Japanese-style Chinese food are often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, although it is not bad, it tends to be criticized as lacking in impact.
&quot;Hiyashi chuka&quot; is no exception, and is still a minor dish in China.
By the way, the name for hiyashi chuka in China is &quot;Japanese-style cold noodles.&quot;
Chinese people recognize it as a Japanese dish.
The summer staple is “Liangpi”
In China, the noodle dish that evokes summer is probably ``liangpi.&#39;&#39;
In Japan, many people may not be familiar with liangpi, but liangpi is a flat noodle made from wheat flour, rice flour, starch, etc. that originated in the Shaanxi province.
In fact, it is said to have a history of 2000 years.
It is a standard B-class gourmet dish that is also sold at food stalls, and is very reasonably priced at around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen).
Although it has the word ``chill&#39;&#39; in it, it is not served with ice like Japanese hiyashi chuka.
Rather, room temperature is the norm.
Top the noodles with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cucumbers, carrots, and boiled bean sprouts, and add condiments such as coriander, chili pepper, ginger, and garlic.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixture of soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste, and peanut paste.
The noodles go down easily and jiggly, and the refreshing sourness and rich, spicy sauce coats them well, making them easy to swallow even when you&#39;re feeling sluggish in the summer and have no appetite.
In addition, because it has spread all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the wide variety of variations is one of the characteristics of liangpi, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

The benefits of cold showers for your body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Suppresses inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a treatment using water) found that it can have a promising effect on physical and mental healing.
Apparently, soaking in cold water after exercise can reduce muscle soreness and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, director of the Korey Stringer Institute, which researches sports medicine, and a professor at the University of Connecticut, ``It&#39;s important to exercise and take cold showers as often as possible. By lowering your body temperature immediately after exercising, you can help your body recover from exercise-induced inflammation and fatigue more quickly.&quot;
reduce fatigue
When you exercise in hot weather, your heart, muscles, and skin require more blood flow than normal.
“When you exercise, your heart rate increases, which increases blood flow to your heart, and it takes energy to contract your muscles, which increases blood flow to your muscles.Also, when it comes to your skin, more blood flows to your heart to regulate your body temperature. Flows in,” says Professor Casa.
&quot;Cold showers lower the temperature of your skin, which reduces the amount of blood flowing to your skin. Instead, it directs blood to your internal organs, such as your stomach and intestines, so you can stay hydrated and nourished even after exercise. This makes it easier to take in, and as a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise.”
Hope for hormesis effect
Droszewski also explains that bathing in cold water can trigger the ``hormesis effect.&#39;&#39;
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better for the body to have a small amount of harmful substances and stress than none at all.
“Hypoxic exercise, short fasting, and cold showers are typical examples of hormesis effects that can be expected to improve your health. Taking a cold shower stimulates hormones and neurotransmitters, improving physical strength and strength. and can develop resilience.”

Hanshin/Oyama, No. 7 in two games in a row!
Manager Yano: ``Looking dignified&#39;&#39; (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Central League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4 wins, 3 losses, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of No. 4 is unstoppable.
The ball soared high and landed in the middle row of the left field seats.
Oyama hits his second consecutive arch and goes all the way around the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, he showed his white teeth.
“While I was making good swings, I was able to focus on the ball I was aiming for and take a bold swing.”
In the 4th inning, 0-2, he entered his turn at bat.
He swung aggressively from the first pitch, and after a foul came the second pitch.
I didn&#39;t miss Yu Ohno&#39;s sweet 134km slider.
The ball I hit with the center of the ball was such a perfect hit that I was sure it was a stand-in the moment I hit it.
Following the previous day&#39;s game against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd, the hits in two consecutive games served as a sign of a counterattack.
It was also a valuable shot from an opponent he was not good at.
When he played against Yu Ohno at Koshien on the 17th, he had nine hits and four runs scored.
However, as far as Nagoya Dome is concerned, they have allowed 7 wins, 1 loss, and 1 holdout in their past 12 games, and have been suffering from a seven-game losing streak since August 23, 2013, with a draw in between.
He got a run from such a difficult opponent for the first time in 23 innings at Nagoya Dome (even if he retired midway through, it still counts as one inning) with a powerful single shot, and did not let the flow of the game slip away.
Manager Yano also said, ``He&#39;s at a high level because he can make good hits with soft pitches.He&#39;s got a sense of style when he&#39;s watching, and even when he&#39;s hitting at the wrong time, he has a great atmosphere.I think he&#39;ll continue to hit well.&#39;&#39; .
In the first inning, he hit to right field, marking six consecutive games with hits and three consecutive games with multiple hits.
Although he started as a substitute at the start of the season, he has already hit 7 home runs and 16 RBIs and is working perfectly as the team&#39;s lead and No. 4.
We will continue to produce results in order to win.

Macau Casino Supervisory Authority inspects the implementation status of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities... New coronavirus negative certificate must be presented upon entry (Macau Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
Approximately 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to 19th due to the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), but strict epidemic prevention measures were taken from February 20th onwards. We are resuming business above.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) is asking operating companies to protect the health of their employees and guests as much as possible when reopening, including ensuring distance between gaming (casino) tables and seating adjacent to each other when playing table games. In order to reduce the risk of cross-infection, measures are being taken to keep the tables open (for example, at baccarat tables, only 3 to 4 people can be seated at one table at the same time), and for slot machines, only every other or every second slot machine will be in operation.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been stepped up.
In addition, guests must wear a mask upon entry, have their temperature taken, and provide a valid health code (recent stay, history of contact with a coronavirus patient, presence of symptoms such as fever or cough, and contact information). ) must be presented.
From midnight on July 15th, a new coronavirus nucleic acid test negative certificate (issued by a licensed facility in Macau or Guangdong Province and within the valid period) must be presented as a condition.
The reason behind the new requirement to present a negative certificate is the relaxation of border measures between Macau and Guangdong Province (elimination of 14-day isolation and quarantine, conditions apply) from 6 a.m. on the 15th. This is a precautionary measure.
On July 18, DICJ inspected the implementation status of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, in response to changes in admission conditions from July 15, and Director General Adriano Ho and others inspected the implementation status of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities. The company held a meeting with department representatives and once again asked them to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing guest admission.
DICJ will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities, hold regular meetings with operating companies based on the situation and evaluation, and take appropriate epidemic prevention measures at casinos in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau. It indicated a policy of making adjustments.
This visit to the casino facility was accompanied by Hayashi Matsu, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Bureau of Health, and provided on-site guidance on disinfecting gaming (casino) chips and maintaining safe distance between seats on electronic casino equipment. It is said that it was done.
Furthermore, due to the sharp decline in inbound tourists due to epidemic prevention measures including entry restrictions, the cumulative casino sales from January to June this year remained at 33.72 billion Macau Pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: approximately 451.9 billion yen), a 77.4% decrease from the same period last year. .
Cheer of Light from Yuwaku Onsen: Message to Medical Workers in place of Bonbori Festival next month (Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual ``Yuwaku Bonbori Festival&#39;&#39; has been canceled due to the effects of the new coronavirus, efforts will begin on August 1 to light up lanterns with messages of support for medical workers.
Approximately 350 paper lanterns will be filled with papers written by fans and local residents from all over the country, and will envelope the town of Yuno in a cheery light, bringing solace to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime ``Hanasaku Iroha,&#39;&#39; modeled after Yuwaku Onsen, and is sponsored by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It started in 2011, when the anime was broadcast, and is visited by anime fans from all over the country every year.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July until the main festival in October, lanterns are hung and lit on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to the public bath.
This year, the festival was forced to be canceled due to the new coronavirus, but the association came up with this plan after hearing from local and national fans that it would be sad not to see lanterns in summer in Yuwaku.
We called it the ``Recovery Campaign&#39;&#39; with the hope of contributing even a little to healing and recovery as the world faces hardships due to the coronavirus pandemic.
So far, around 50 students from local Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have each written an illustrated message, and over 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
You can purchase a message form from the association&#39;s website, fill it out, put it in a return envelope, and send it to the association, where you will receive a photo of it attached to a lantern and lit.
Each set costs 6,000 yen, and applications will be accepted until a total of about 350 lanterns are available.
The lanterns are scheduled to be lit until the end of November.
Shinichiro Yamashita (48), who has been the chairman of the festival&#39;s executive committee since the first time, said, ``Reading the messages gives us courage as well.We want to hold a grand festival next year, which will be the 10th edition.&#39;&#39;
For the campaign, we have also prepared new illustrations of Hanasaku Iroha characters and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge.
Starting on the 1st, we will be giving illustrated clear files to users of special accommodation plans at inns in Yuwaku Onsen.

Mori and Yamakawa, who were drafted first and second in 2013, Tonosaki, who was drafted third in 2014, and Genda, who was drafted third in 2016, are the &quot;core four&quot; of fielders that team officials refer to as &quot;the heart of our team right now.&quot; 〟.
All of them have experience as captains in their amateur days, and their sense of responsibility is greater than most.
Tonosaki, who took over the captaincy from Yamakawa in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, ``Yamakawa-san is a good talker, so he is the captain who leads the team with his words.On the other hand, I&#39;m not good at talking, so I leave the talking to the vice captain who is good at talking, and I sit behind the scenes. &quot;He was the type of person who was prepared to take action,&quot; and each of them is supporting the new captain, Genda, and the new player chairman, Mori, while demonstrating their own individuality.
Director Tsuji praised ``Genda Moriyama&#39;&#39;, saying, ``Genda&#39;s safety? That wasn&#39;t a sign. But that made me think, ``Okay, we can go.&#39;&#39; Tomoya also had a great bunt. Tonosaki also hit well.&#39;&#39; Cooperation of souls.
All four are currently struggling with batting averages of .24 to .25, but they are supporting the team with their wisdom and ways to win even if they can&#39;t hit.

Bringing art closer to you during the coronavirus pandemic: Online art museum &quot;HASARD&quot; launched by Konno (from Hachinohe) (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There are museums where anyone can experience art for free whenever they like.
The collection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown domestic artists.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online art museum &quot;HASARD&quot; has captured the hearts of users with its convenience and novelty, and with the new lifestyle caused by the coronavirus pandemic, it has received even more attention. Ta.
CEO Shinnosuke Konno (26), a Hachinohe native and resident of Tokyo, who launched the site, says, ``I wanted to create a service where everyone can enjoy art easily.I want people to come into contact with art even in difficult times.&#39;&#39;
When you visit Other, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, including permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions, are open to the public, and the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the colors but also the texture of the brush strokes attract viewers.
There is no need for membership registration or admission fees, so it is free of charge not only for viewers but also for artists who want to hold solo exhibitions.
The way it is presented online is also attracting attention.
One of these is moving pictures.
In Claude Monet&#39;s permanent exhibition ``It Begins to Move Again,&#39;&#39; clouds, flowers, meadows, and other objects are digitally processed to appear as if they are moving.
``We want to make it accessible even to people who have little interest in art,&#39;&#39; said Konno, and it allows you to experience the feeling of being inside the painting.
Representative Konno first encountered art when he was in elementary school.
When I visited the Aomori Museum of Art with my family, which had just been completed at the time, I saw the three giant paintings of Marc Chagall&#39;s ``Aleko&#39;&#39; and was shocked by their power.
The next day, art class turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo to attend university, he began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that many people don&#39;t have many opportunities to interact with art for a variety of reasons, such as not having art museums nearby, major exhibitions only being held in the metropolitan area, or being unable to go out because they are raising children.
So, while working at an IT-related company, he spent about two months setting up a site where people could appreciate art online.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to approximately 30,000 after the spread of the new coronavirus.
If anyone could appreciate art in any way they want, whenever they want.
Azar&#39;s aim has unexpectedly been accepted by more people due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Representative Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation, saying that it enriches the imagination.
“When your imagination becomes richer, you will be able to reach out to those in need.
&quot;I hope that by making art more accessible, we can create a better society.&quot;
A simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is ending and the era of Japanese quality is coming (Modern Business) - Yahoo! News
A shift in values due to the pandemic
There are various predictions and discussions about the after-pandemic world.
On the business side, there is an article on July 8th titled ``Management jobs are actually starting to disappear in Japan...!The cruel reality&#39;&#39;, and an article on July 4th titled ``In the &#39;post-corona&#39; world, In fact, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in ``Japan&#39;s manufacturing industry&#39;&#39; is likely to make a major comeback...!&#39;&#39;
[Photo] The true nature of &quot;Japan&#39;s strength&quot; that only Japanese people don&#39;t know...An unexpected reality seen in Asia
In addition, on the mental side, there is an article on June 26th titled, ``Knowledge for complete combustion&#39;&#39; for those who have become conscious of the end of their lives due to the coronavirus, and an article on June 10th, ``Now is the time for corona, full of riots.&#39;&#39; It seems that trends such as ``Let&#39;s reconsider the effectiveness of ``relying on God in times of hardship&#39;&#39; will become mainstream.
What we believe will become clearly visible to us as a combination of these two &quot;materials (economy/business)&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; is the major trend from &quot;Chinese quality to Japanese quality.&quot;
For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it is infuriating, but the life of the person who purchased it is not at risk.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of Chinese-made masks and respirators that have recently become a hot topic... &quot;Chinese quality&quot; is deadly in products like these that are directly connected to life and safety.
You can&#39;t buy such products no matter how cheap they are.
People will probably want ``Japanese quality&#39;&#39; products even if they have to pay a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not only occurring in Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which have fallen into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, have returned products one after another due to the poor quality of the &quot;Chinese quality.&quot;
Safety and security over cheapness
Products such as automobiles are also products in which a defect can be fatal (death due to an accident).
No matter how aggressive China, South Korea, and other countries are with their ``cheap or bad&#39;&#39; bargain sales strategy, in the end they cannot compete with Japanese-made products. The reason for the situation described in ``Will Japan bow down to Toyota?&#39;&#39; is because there is a strong demand for ``Japanese quality&#39;&#39; in automobile products.
This pandemic has also reminded us that many other products also require &quot;safety and security.&quot;
Furthermore, safety and security are important not only in ``Japanese quality in manufacturing&#39;&#39; but also in ``Japanese quality in logistics and other services.&#39;&#39;
As in the case of the toilet paper scandal, even if there is sufficient production capacity, there are cases in which intermediate distribution is delayed and the product does not arrive.
Furthermore, as the April 17th article ``Who is the real culprit behind the mask shortage? Don&#39;t forgive the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s thieves&#39;&#39;, self-sufficiency within Japan is also an important element of ``safety and security.&#39;&#39; It made me keenly aware of that.
In an emergency, it is natural for any country to prioritize its own country, and it is extremely important to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food domestically.
More than 100 new coronavirus infections in South Korea for the first time in 115 days = highest number of people coming from overseas at 86 (Yonhap News) - Yahoo! News
[Seoul Yonhap News] South Korea&#39;s Central Epidemic Prevention Task Force announced on the 25th that as of midnight that day, the number of people infected with the new coronavirus had increased by 113 from midnight the previous day, bringing the total to 14,092. did.
This is the first time in 115 days that the number of new infections per day exceeded 100 since April 1 (101 people).
This appears to be because 32 sailors on a Russian ship that entered Busan Port were found to be infected, and 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.
The number of new infections in South Korea was in the 30-60 range except on the 20th (26 people).
Of the new infections announced on the 25th, 86 people came from overseas, the highest number since January 20, when the first infected person was reported in South Korea.
The largest number of people arrived from Iraq at 36, followed by 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
On the other hand, there were 27 confirmed cases of community infection, with 11 cases each in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, and 5 cases in Busan.

Nagoya player Miyahara tests positive for coronavirus, first in J1 soccer league since league restart | Shizuoka Shimbun At-S
J1 soccer team Nagoya announced on the 25th that it was confirmed that defender Kazuya Miyahara (24) has tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first positive test result in a player since the J.League restarted.
He is the third player from the club to be infected, following forward forward Yumeo Kanazaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31), both of whom were infected in June.
The two have already received treatment and have returned to the game.
This season, Miyahara was on the bench in the J1 match against Oita held at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th and announced that they had conducted PCR tests on 60 players and staff on the same day.

White paint derived from Teflon-treated frying pans has been found to improve cooling effects through insulation!
An unexpectedly great discovery!
This year&#39;s rainy season was marked by an unusually high amount of precipitation, but once it ends, the extremely hot summer will be in full swing.
It&#39;s so hot and scorching hot that even the air conditioner doesn&#39;t work... Just thinking about it makes you feel sick, right?
Global warming is a major worldwide problem, and humans have been racking their brains to figure out how to survive the hot summer months as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear light, white clothing.
Hey, there&#39;s no need to go out of your way to wear heat-absorbing black clothes in the summer, right?
And it seems that the same principle is being applied to the architecture of houses, and cases of using white paint are increasing.
Although white is white, the latest research field was whether it was possible to create a paint that reflects more light and absorbs less heat.
Recently, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University&#39;s Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, has teamed up with researchers from Columbia University&#39;s Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics to create the most efficient way to reflect solar heat and cool the interior of buildings. He announced that he had found a way to mix white paint that would improve its effectiveness.
The aim is to put it into practical use as soon as possible.
Until now, the white paint with the highest reflectance of sunlight was one using titanium oxide, which had a reflectance of 85%.
White paints using titanium oxide are already being applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, helping to block solar heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, what has been newly discovered is a white paint derived from the fluororesin polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in things like Teflon-treated frying pans.
This white paint that utilizes the Teflon effect is said to reflect nearly 98% of the sun&#39;s rays, making it possible to significantly reduce heat.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint that uses Teflon, you can spend time indoors without being exposed to the intense heat.
Maybe such an era will come soon?
It seems like the roofs of Japanese houses tend to be dark in color, but do you think white will become more mainstream in the future?
Amazon&#39;s annual big sale, when will it be held this year?
CNBC reported on July 21 that Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its large annual sale, ``Prime Day.&#39;&#39;
The event is held in July every year, but it was reported that this year it had to be postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
■ Spokesperson: ``Details will be announced soon.&#39;&#39; An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
“Prime Day has become a special and celebratory event that we look forward to over the past five years. will be held on
However, he did not reveal the specific date, only saying, ``Details will be announced soon.&#39;&#39;
However, we have decided to hold the event in India.
A press release was posted on the country&#39;s website.
It was explained that it would be carried out for 48 hours from midnight on August 6th.
Until now, Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year they may take unusual measures.
■ A large-scale event that generated sales of 760 billion yen in two days Amazon started this large-scale sale for its members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure during the summer when sales decline.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but the scale has expanded year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15th in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia. carried out.
According to the company, sales for the two-day period last year exceeded previous sales results for Black Friday (the first day of the year-end sales season) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
This event also contributes to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid membership ``Prime,&#39;&#39; and last year, the number of applications on the first day was the highest ever in a single day, and the second highest number on the next day.
Last year, it sold 175 million products worldwide.
Regarding this, Internet Retailer, a specialist magazine for the online mail order industry, reported that total global sales for the two days were $7.16 billion (approximately 760 billion yen), an increase of 70% from the previous year.
Excessive restrictions on mobile number transfers are under scrutiny.
What about fees and points?
(Newswitch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is starting full-scale studies to revise the Mobile Number Portability System (MNP), which allows users to use their old phone number as is when changing mobile phone carriers.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they announced a plan to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
The specific points at issue are wide-ranging, including the nature of MNP fees and the pros and cons of holding back those who wish to transfer.
With opposition expected from telecommunications companies, all eyes are on whether the move will help promote healthy market competition.
Unlimited mobile phone switching is still far from being a reality for telecommunications companies When MNP was introduced in 2006, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee income for the three major mobile communications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen annually.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications enumerated the current situation surrounding MNP at the ``Working Group (WG) on Verification of Competition Rules,&#39;&#39; a panel of experts that discusses the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
They also criticized the opening hours for issuing MNP reservation numbers, which are required when consumers transfer to another carrier.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications online, but due to operational reasons for their core systems, most applications are accepted between 9:00 and 20:00.
The working group&#39;s materials clearly stated that the direction of future considerations would be to provide all-day support in principle.
It is also viewed as a problem that mobile carriers try to deter people who wish to transfer to MNP by giving them points.
This was based on the judgment that excessive restrictions could impede fair competition.
Partner Shunichi Kita of Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of the working group, said, ``We will ask users to give us time to explain the provision of economic benefits or obtain their permission, and we will promptly issue a number to users who do not consent and end the process.&#39;&#39; &quot;It is important to first thoroughly implement this process.&quot;
However, among the series of points at issue, regarding MNP fees, there is a structural problem: ``The higher the fees, the harder it is to lose customers, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower them.&#39;&#39; (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications official) said.
If an operator emerges that takes the initiative to lower MNP fees, there are concerns that the number of customers leaving that company will increase and that corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require users to pay fees for MNP, and there is a possibility that Japan will do the same.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications plans to compile the results of the working group into a report around September or October, and then begin procedures to revise the MNP guidelines.
If revisions are made, they are expected to take place after 2021.
Mobile carriers are likely to have to worry about issues such as sales and customer support.
Chunichi&#39;s Katsuno does not get the right to be the winning pitcher despite six scoreless innings (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Masayoshi Katsuno (23) started the 8th game against Hanshin (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He gave up four hits and no runs in six innings.
&quot;I pitched last time, so I thought it was my last chance. I got a walk, but I was able to compete with my opponent without worrying too much.&quot;
In both of his first starts this season and the previous game against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, he struggled with ball control and retired by the fourth inning.
He was unable to fulfill his role as a starter, and this time he faced a backwater in which he was trying to survive in the first team.
This time, he aggressively attacked the Tigers&#39; batting line-up with a spirited ball.
Once he hit a fastball in the high 140km/h range, he was also able to effectively use curveballs such as counting pitches.
In the 6th inning, Suns hit a double to left center field, but he grounded out Oyama to left and Bohr to second base, resulting in two outs and third base.
In the match against Fukudome here, he drove in with two pitches, and ended up with a fork.
He got out of trouble by getting a strikeout in a three-pitch contest.
Katsuno finished the 6th inning with 83 pitches, but as soon as the game ended in the middle of the inning, Manager Yoda came off the bench and announced a pitcher change.
Isamu Nishi, who played in a pitcher&#39;s battle, had 108 pitches at the same time, but because he got off the mound first, he was unable to earn his first win of the season.

According to CBS Sports, Betts rejected a 10-year, $300 million offer from the Red Sox last year.

However, at Seibu, he had no experience hitting a walk-off, and was teased by Manager Tsuji and Baba, the strategy, defense, and base running coach, who told him, ``You don&#39;t have it.&#39;&#39;
He bounced back from the negative reputation and produced his second walk-off win of the season.
Coach Tsuji praised him, saying, ``I asked the goddess of victory just for today. She hit well.&#39;&#39;
3rd place with 2 savings, 1 game behind leader Softbank.

Heavy rains disrupt traffic in Hokuen; 10 km of National Route 152 is closed; some sections of the JR Iida Line are closed | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
National Route 152 has been completely closed to traffic, with lines of cars waiting to take a detour with alternate traffic on one side. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Tatsuyama-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu City. (Photo partially edited)
Heavy rains in July caused severe damage in Kyushu and other parts of Japan, and the Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was one of the hardest hit areas in Shizuoka Prefecture.
The effects of the landslide remain on National Route 152, the main road, and the JR Iida Line, the main road for people&#39;s daily life, and many areas will take time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience in their daily lives, residents are increasingly worried about the negative impact on economic activity.
At Sejiri Bridge, which spans the Tenryu River in Tatsuyama-cho, the ward, there are long lines of cars waiting to pass during the day.
The first car remained stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
Approximately 10 kilometers of National Route 152 has been completely closed to traffic, requiring a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River to travel within the town.
However, the road is narrow and the entire section has alternating traffic on one side, so waiting times are unpredictable.
A landslide occurred on the national highway in the same town on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the danger of falling rocks on the nearby slope.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba Tunnel, which is within the restricted section, and there is no estimate yet as to when it will reopen to traffic.
In 2018, the town&#39;s national highway was closed due to landslides, which had a negative impact on residents&#39; lives and tourism.
Kimie Tamamoto (76), CEO of the Dragon Mama Processing Plant, which sells specialty products, said in a tone of voice, ``This is an additional blow to the situation where the number of customers has decreased due to the new coronavirus.The number of customers has decreased significantly.&#39;&#39;
