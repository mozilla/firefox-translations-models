Dankan Robinson, who won the98-98 game, was the 18th place in Team High, and theラーler Hero followed the 15th place and backcoat.
In addition to Robinson, the league's best shooter, the step-up of theヒーロー, which is nominated 13th overall draft, is an important element for heat.
Hero lost 15 games from February to March due to anケ injury, and the last season entered a long period of time.
Hero has been able to regain 100% condition because it has plenty of time. “It’s the best thing I’ve ever felt,” SメーMAGE’s performance was more powerful than words.
Hero’s playtime has increased due to the delay of the confluence of Kendrick Nan, the former point guard.
The value is large because it scores 15 on the role that is different from usual.
Jimmy Butler, the team leader, praised theチーム of "favorites".
“Aiha can also handler, deprive the score, and defend. It’s a player who can do everything for the team. The idea is not that of the rookie. “I’m looking at the video and researching, where the teammates move, and how they’re free, and how they’re doing it.”
In front of the opening of this season, the Butler cares about the strength of the loss and the strength of theケ, and theックic attitude of the busque.
That’s why I’ve been training together for individuals starting at 4am.
Butler once said, “Oh, I say my opinion to anyone, and I don’t pull it down.” He said, “I can respect such a fight.”
It is a type that makes me think that it is a butler, and if you think it will be for a team, you will be aware that collision will occur, and you will have a severe opinion.
The relationship with teammates was worse.
Butler is overlapping with his。.
The irritating butler’s personality for teammates is a good guide for those who just come about it.
If two discipleships respect each other bound to the entire team, the heat should be a team that aims further.

Instantly detects crisis occurrences from net information, dema also judges (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know where any disaster or accident occurred quickly!"
This is not limited to TV and newspapers, but also has strong needs for social infrastructure companies and local governments.
Spectee is a service that responds to it.
[Photo] Alerts from Quarkty to determine the authenticity of social media information
Now, the first way people know the occurrence of disasters and accidents is moving from TV to internet information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter is an important media to send information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult for people to watch a lot of information and extract useful information from them.
Quティi has a function to detect and analyze the contents of natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc., and distribute it to the company after determining the truth of the information.
“A wide range of negative impact events that stop and stop social activities” (CEO Kenjiro Murakami) is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crisis occurrences occurring both inside and outside Japan.
NHK in the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April 2016 was the first major use case of クity, and then the adoption movement was rapidly spread between companies.
Not only TV stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and more than 350 local governments in Japan are using ティity.
■ Analyze を and determine the type and place of occurrence of crisis
Quocti delivers information based on four steps: "Collection of Information", "An  and Content Classification", "Title", and "False Judgment".
The Company shall pre-specify the category of crisis (e.g., disasters, accidents, etc.) to collect information.
Quティ collects posts that correspond to the specification using the API provided by social media.
Next, analyze and classify text, images and videos included in the投稿.
For example, if the fire truck is reflected, the black smoke rises from the building and the orange flame is coming out from the room, it is classified as "fire".
In addition, if the image of the lying car is "traffic accident" and the image of the lying road, it is classified as "road coronary water".
Quティi also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
Mr. Murakami says, “I often don’t know where to go from the post, so I’m 、 various information.”
For example, if a road sign or sign is reflected in the image or video, extract the information of the local name from it, and match it with the local name database to identify the location.

Japan's "Cold Chinese" is not Chinese ... ?
"Cold Noodles" popular dish - Yahoo! News
Cold」oodles in China
As stated in the beginning, cold Chinese is a Chinese dish originating in Japan (Japanese-style Chinese), which was developed based on the Chinese “cooling surface (Lyan Bambien)” (Japanese-style Chinese).
Therefore, it is not originally in China, but since the  ification of food, it seems to be seen in Japanese restaurant in summer.
Also recently, at the convenience store in Japan, we have also appeared a product named "Japanese style buckwheat面oodles / buckwheat cold oodles", "Kawaka chicken cool side / Shikokawa style chicken cold。oodles".
On the other hand, it is pressed into Chinese cuisine that has the effect of a trendy punch such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine, and the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese in China is not so high.
Of course, the taste of Japanese-style Chinese is often familiar with Chinese people.
That’s why it’s not unpleasant, but it tends to be cruelly appreciated if it’s poorly impacted.
"Cold Chinese" is not an exception, but it is still in China.
The name of chilled Chinese in China is "Japanese style cold oodles".
Chinese people are recognized as one of the Japanese cuisines.
Summer trekking is "Ryanpy"
In China, it is said that it is a皮oodle dish that feels summer.
In Japan, there are many people who are not familiar with it, but the cool skin is flat。oodles made of皮 flour, rice flour, starch etc.
It is said that there is a history of 2000.
The price is 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen).
The word "cool" is included, but it does not have to shield it with ice like a cold Chinese in Japan.
It is a basic temperature.
On top of the oodles, topping the ingredients of your choice, such as shredded cucumbers,ジンs,ヤedヤashes, and so on.
Finally, a special seasoning is completed with a mixture of soy sauce, ladle oil, vinegar, sesame paste andナッツanut paste.
The oodles that are well throated and pulled are well tangled with sour and rich water, and even when there is no appetite with summer batte.
In addition, because it penetrates all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the variation is also characteristic of cool skin, which is one of the ways to enjoy.

"Cool Water Shower" brings to the body and mind - Yahoo! News
Reduce inflammation such as muscle pain
Research on the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water treatment) published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences reveals the potential for physical and mental healing.
You can reduce muscle soreness and other in mmatory effects by getting cold after exercise.
Professor Douglas Kasa, who teaches at the University of Connecticut, is responsible for “Korey Stringer Institute” researching sports medicine. After moving the body, it is said that the body temperature will be lowered immediately and the recovery from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise will be faster.
Reduce fatigue
If you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin will usually need more blood flow.
"In exercise, the heart rate increases, so the blood flow to the heart increases, and the muscle flow increases because it requires energy to shrink the muscles. Professor Kasa said, “In terms of the skin, many blood flows to adjust body temperature.”
"The temperature of the skin decreases by removing the cold water shower, so the blood flow sent to the skin can be suppressed. Instead, the blood flow is sent to the internal organs such as the gastrointestinal, which makes it easier to consume moisture and。rition after exercise. As a result, you can reduce fatigue that you feel after exercise."
Hope for Holmyシス effect
Drozevsky said he could expect the “holmesis effect” to be generated by cold water.
Holmyシス effect is the idea that it is better to have only a little more than no harmful substance or stress for the body.
"Low oxygen exercises, petit fasting, and cold water showers are examples of hormosis effects for health. By doing a cold water shower, hormones and neurotransmitters are stimulated and they can improve physical and physical toughness and resilience.”

A simple reason for the era of quality in China ended and the era of quality in Japan (modern business) - Yahoo! News
Change of values with pandemic
There are various predictions and discussions about the world of afterpandemic.
In terms of business, the work of "Management" in Japan has started to disappear ... ! The cruel reality , July 4th article "The world of "after refugees", the fact that "Japan's manufacturing" seems to be revived ... ! "There is a possibility of change.
[Photo] The authenticity of “Japan’s strength” that only Japanese people do not know... An unexpected reality seen in Asia
In terms of spirituality, I think that the mainstream of the flow such as "the full burning heart gain" to give to people who are conscious of the end of life in 、," the article on June 10th, "Let's recons。 the effect of "the god of bitterness" is now full of 動ence."
We believe that the two “materials (economy and business)” and “精神rit” will become visible to our eyes as a form of conjugation.
For example, if there is a defect or defect with a T-shirt or digital camera, it is abdo。. However, there is no separate order for the person who purchased it.
On the other hand, Chinese masks and artificial re、ratory quality that have recently become a hot topic ... ... "Chinese quality" in products that directly connect such life and safety is fatal.
You can't buy such products at a reasonable price.
Even if you pay a reasonable price, you will be asked for a Japanese quality product.
Of course, this flow is not only happening in Japan.
It is also clear that the countries in which masks and medical devices are in a difficult situation are still "return" to the品質ibleness of "Chinese quality" one after another.
Safety and security
In addition, products such as automobiles can be fatal (damaging due to accident).
Even if the countries such as China and South Korea are attacked by the cheaper strategy of "Are you safe?" After all, it is impossible to beat Japanese swords, and the article on June 16th "Are you sure to win alone, and the world's automakers れ up to Toyota? "It is because "Japan quality" is strongly required for automobile products.
And this pandemic reminded that many other products require "safety and security".
In addition, safety and security are important not only for Japanese quality in manufacturing, but also for Japanese quality in logistics services.
As with the toilet paper, the production capacity is very good, but the intermediate distribution may not be delayed.
In addition, on April 17th, the true のprit of the lack of masks is who! Like the article of “Do not allow firefield 棒efs of the Chinese Republican government”, I felt that self-sufficient self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of “safety and security”.
It is very important to be able to procure necessities such as masks (医療機器 devices) and food in your own country in any country.

White was not able to be a paint that does not absorb heat by reflecting light even in white, or it was also in the latest research field.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), has collaborated with researchers in the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics of、 University to find the most efficient way to prepare white paints to improve the cooling effect inside the building.
We are aiming for early practical use.
The maximum reflectivity of the sunlight was the use of titanium oxide to reach 85% reflectance.
The white paint with titanium oxide is already applied to the roof of a high-  environment, and it is used to block solar heat to increase cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white paint comes from polyトラfluoroチ (PTFE) fluoro  resin, which is used for frying pans of teflon processing.
This teflon effect is applied white paint, which reflects the sunlight up to almost 98%, making it possible to cut large heat.
Even in hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to heat.
Is it possible to come to the near future?
I think that the roof of a Japanese house has a lot of dark color, but I think that the white system is the mainstream from now on?
Amazon’s annual large-scale sale, this year’s celebration?
CNBC reported the postponement of the annual large-scale sale "Prime Day".
It is held in July every year, but it is said that it is forced to postpone due to the spread of coronavirus infection.
■ Public Relations Officer , "Details will be announced soon" Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
“Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we wait for fun in the past 5 years. "We will be held at a later time than usual, while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and sellers."
However, I did not disclose the specific date of the event to say "Details will be announced soon".
On the other hand, I decided to hold in India.
Press releases are posted on the website of the country.
August 6th, I explained that it will be carried out from 0 am to 48 hours.
Prime Day has been held at the same time in the world, but it may take an example of the game.
Amazon started a large-scale sale for this member in 2015 as a measure to promote sales in summer where イベント decreases.
Initially, it was a 24 hour event, but it was expanded year by year. Last year, it was held in 18 countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia.
According to the company, two days of sales exceeded the sales performance of "Black Friday" (first day of the end of the year) and "Cyber Monday" (the next Monday).
This event also contributes to the acquisition of new members of the paid member "Prime". Last year, the number of applications for the first day became the number of last year, and the next day was the number.
Last year, we sold more than 175 million products.
For this reason, the Internet retailer of the online mail order industry reported that the total sales amount of the world for two days was increased by 70% compared to the previous year.
Severe eyes to mobile number migration and excessive pulling.
How do I earn commissions and points?
Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has made a full-fledged review of the same number migration system (MNP) that can be used as it is when changing a mobile communication company.
On the 21st, the MNP Guidelines were revised in 2004.
There are a wide range of topics such as how MNP fees are available, and how to close them to those who wish to change.
While the telecommunications company is expected to rebound, attention will be集 to promote healthy market competition.
The service charge was 2000 yen.
MNP fee income of three major mobile communication companies rises to 15 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications enumerated the current state of MNP in the “Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG)” meeting, which discusses the competition environment in the communication market.
The time of issue of MNP reservation number required for the consumer to transfer to another telecommunications company was also posted.
Major communication companies are accepting on the web, but from the convenience of operating the core system, the reception time is 9-20.
In the WG document, as the direction of the future study, it is stated that it is based on the principle of all-day response.
It is also a problem that the mobile communication company gives points to those who wish to move with MNP.
Excessive fastening is the judgment that the competition cannot be in ted.
Toshikazu Kita partner of Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG members, “You can have time to explain about the provision of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user, and immediately issue and 。 the number to the user who does not agree. "It is important to thoroughly understand this process."
However, for the MNP fee in the series of reasons, it is confirmed that the structural problem of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is lying, "The higher the customer will be less likely to leak, so it is difficult to actively lower the働き."
In the event of a business operator who leads the MNP fee, it is also concerned that the customer outflow from the company will increase and the company will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications pointed out that many countries do not require a user burden fee for MNPs overseas, and it is possible that it will be in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications intends to report the results of the WG as a report in September and October, and then start the procedure for the revision of the MNP Guidelines.
When the amendment is made, it is considered to be 21 years or later.
Mobile communication companies may be worried about sales and customer support.

The home where the wife holds the wallet is 45 %!
My husband is happy?
"This month's caring, I'm not enough ..." is said from my husband, or is there a wife of立ry?
This conversation is a family with a wallet.
In the world, how many households your wife holds a wallet?
Also, let's see the word "Co-managed" together.
Which wallets hold?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. surveyed the following results from the results of the survey on the management situation of couples with a total of 800 people, as a result of the survey on the management situation of couples with a total of 400 young couples in their 20-30s and over 30 years of marriage.
What is a household wallet?
Wife:45.0% Husband:24.8% The most common result of the household whose wife manages the household.
It seems that there are many episodes, even if both manage.
Aママ is Aフィ, a high school student and a high school student.
A。 manages a household account.
Since there were many months in which the student’s deficit deficit came out, he decided to negotiate to the husband.
However, I showed a family book because it was said to be "What kind of income is it?"
I had to write all the expenses, but when I looked at the household book, it was not a deficit.
It seems that A  is not good at managing households, so please manage everything.
Later, when A  interviewed his husband, he said, "It is true that there is no time and energy to manage various households (e.g. school material costs, PTA expenses, etc.), although it is dissatisfied with the management method such as caring".
Husband manages households: For B主婦, B , a dedicated housewife, is busy daily with daily living expenses from the husband.
In the spring of last year, the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, so B  asked the husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was busy buying a refrigeration cabinet, but still the refrigeration part can be used.
However, if you want to prepare an environment where your husband can eat ice at any time in summer, it seems that the palm of the hand is backed up saying "Let's buy refrigerator, after all?"
Therefore, B  seems to have been silent to a friend with "the husband is the more kechi"
