Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Young people's pedal misstep accidents occur frequently (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Violations that violate the Road Traffic Act
The number of reports of accidents caused by incorrect operation, such as pedal missteps, is increasing, but it is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem for elderly drivers.
In the number of pedal missteps by age group (2015 National Police Agency data), the most common age group was 1080cases under 24years old, exceeding 1032cases for those aged 75 and over.
Mistakes are never common among the elderly, and it is important to call attention to the same age.
Do you want to take a fashionable foot?
Do you want to be safe?
This data does not describe the ratio of men and women or the cause, but unlike the elderly, who are thought to come from the decline of the body, such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may be inadvertently distracted by other things such as music and conversation, and mistakes due to clothes etc. may be wrong.
In particular, some women choose high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, depending on their clothes for the day, and drive them as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people think that it is troublesome to change clothes, but there are many people who drive without thinking about the possibility of danger at all and driving without vileness.
However, driving with high heels and sandals violates the Road Traffic Act.
One is "Violation of duty of safe driving" in which "the steering wheel, brake, and other operations shall be reliably operated" and "the driver must not cause an accident and harm the person."
The other is "Violation of the Compliance of the Public Safety Committee" in which the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee. For example, in the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law Enforcement Bylaws, there is a sentence in Article XII: "Do not wear shoes that may interfere with the operation of the driver, or do not drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operations."
In each prefecture, the same is true of the purpose of considering driving with "shoots that may interfere with driving operation" as a violation, even if it is not specified as high heels.
Why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is obvious when considering the basics of pedal operation safely.
For safe pedal operation, first fix the heel of the foot to the floor, put the foot to be perpendicular to the brake pedal, and tilt the foot to the right with the full point when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to fix it firmly so that the heel does not shake.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded to the floor is small, and it always blurs, and because the entire foot is attached to the height of the heel, the area of the foot to be grounded on the pedal is small and it is not possible to step firmly, and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
This is thought to lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have a floor carpet, but this material is easy to catch the heel of the high heel, and the heel is caught when the heel is caught and the pedal can not be stepped on, or the high heel may be taken off due to the beat of the heel, sandwiched in the back of the pedal, and it may not be able to step on.
In addition, there are cases where the heel gets stuck in the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and then returns it, and the accelerator pedal can no longer return.

The U.S., the lowest number of refugee admissions slots for the third year in a row, eighteen thousand people|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Tuesday announced a policy to reduce the number of refugees from around the world to eighteen thousand in the 2020 fiscal year (October-September 20th).
It will renew the minimum number since the 1980s, when the Refugee Act was enacted, for the third year in a row.
The Trump administration is aiming to appeal to conservatives with a strict immigration and refugee policy in the face of next year’s presidential election.
While there are constant people who are being chased by countries in various places, it is inevitable that criticism from human rights groups will be drawn.
The Obama administration set the upper limit for the 17th fiscal year to eleven thousand, but the Trump administration, which was inaugurated in January, overturned this and cut it to fifty thousand.
In the 18th fiscal year, it decreased year by year to forty-five thousand, and in the 19th fiscal year, it continued to decrease year by year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Bulgaria's Prime Minister Borisov on Monday during an official visit to South Korea at the Cheongwadae (president's office) to discuss substantive ways to expand cooperation between the two countries.
This is the first time the Bulgarian Prime Minister has visited the country.
President Moon welcomed the visit to South Korea ahead of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year, and highly appreciated the leadership of Prime Minister Borisov, who is leading Bulgaria's development.
The two leaders appreciated the continued increase in trade and investment between the two countries amid the growing global protectionism, and agreed to work together to expand economic cooperation in the future.
President Moon welcomed Bulgaria's policy of granting the status of "strategic investors" to South Korean companies, and said he hoped that based on this, the investment of Korean companies in Bulgaria would be promoted.
He also stressed that South Korea could be the best partner for Bulgaria as Bulgaria promoted the introduction of nuclear power and the modernization of its national defense, and called for interest and cooperation to enable South Korean companies to participate in the Bulgarian government's order of nuclear power plants and the promotion of the defense industry.
The two leaders also agreed to strengthen future-oriented cooperation in the field of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and auto parts and renewable energy.
Prime Minister Borisov hoped that close cooperation would be held in the fields of information and communication technology (ICT), which is led by South Korea, in the fields of science and technology and education.
He also discussed the peace process on the Korean Peninsula, and President Moon expressed gratitude for Bulgaria's support for the South Korean government's efforts to consolidate peace on the Korean Peninsula, including by issuing a statement in support of the North-South and U.S.-North Korea summits.

Kinki Ceramics, a local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, manufactures Awaji-gawara, files for quasi-self-insolvency debt of about two billion yen (Imperial Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
The slump in housing market and the repeated damage from the earthquake also affected the progress of "consumers' tile roofs"
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB company code: 530173983, capital 9920 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Kozo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-insolvency to the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The application agent is Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishi-Tenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka, Japan; Yoshida Daichi Law Office; telephone: 06-6365-6038) and one other person.
The company was a tawara manufacturer that was reorganized into a corporation in April 1961.
Initially, under the trade name of Kinki-gangyo Co., Ltd., he started his business as a local manufacturer of Ibushi-gawara, a local industry on Awaji Island, in Nishiawa-cho, Mihara-gun (now Minamiawaji City).
At the same time as the merger of Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. were succeeded, the head office was moved to the current location after changing to the current trade name.
After that, it opened sales bases in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and it became the current system, and in the past, it was mainly made of Ibushi-gawara, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western roof tiles such as flat roof tiles are currently manufactured at a rate of 70% and Japanese roof tiles such as Ibushi-gawara.
The company has built a wide range of operating bases mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile maker of Awaji Island.
However, demand for housing conditions has been sluggish since the Lehman shock, and the rapid damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, resulting in sluggish demand for consumers leaving the roof of the roof.
In terms of profitability, in addition to the decline in profit margins due to soaring fuel prices, the company was forced to face a severe financial position due to a continuous deficit due to the burden of inventory and excessive interest-bearing debt associated with business fixed investment.
For this reason, although the Bank had requested financial institutions to ease the repayment conditions of their loans, there was no sign of recovery in business conditions, and the cash flow was gradually tightened.
I was unable to support it, so I gave up on business continuity, and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be around two billion yen.
The Prefectural Dinosaur Museum in Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture, which promotes the industrialization of tourism (Japanese aerial and small drone shooting)
Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture, announced on September 25th that it would acquire about 25300m2 of land (Aratsu-cho, Fukui City) adjacent to the construction site of the roadside station "Dinosaur Valley Katsuyama" that will open next spring.
In order to accelerate the "industrialization of tourism" advocated by the city and the local business community, it aims to attract hotels and restaurants that are specialized in accommodation.
The board members explained at the special committee on the development of attraction centers of the city council on the same day.
In addition to opening the Hokuriku Shinkansen in the spring of 2023, the city plans to promote a shift from a day-trip to a stay-at-home tourism center, with a view to opening all sections of the Chubu Jukan Expressway in the prefecture, the expansion and renovation of the prefectural dinosaur museum (Katsuyama City) and strengthening its functions, and the city intends to attract people based on accommodation facilities.
We will acquire a private idle area next to the roadside station construction site east.
Surrounded by the Kuzuryu River, Takinami River, and prefectural roads, it is more than twice the size of a roadside station (approximately twenty-two thousand square meters).
In the name of industrial housing complex development, the City Land Development Corporation will proceed with land negotiations from this fiscal year, and after the acquisition of the land, the land will be created in the 21st fiscal year.
According to the city, there are already calls from private businesses such as farm restaurants and harvesting facilities, fast food, and restaurants.
As for accommodation facilities, Sekisui House also revealed that the city has made a name for itself to attract accommodation-specific hotels adjacent to roadside stations planned throughout the country.
Sekisui House is scheduled to expand to three locations in Fukui Prefecture, but several other cities and towns have indicated their intention to attract them, and there is a possibility that they will compete.
The city is also planning to build a parking lot.
Some members of the committee called for speeding up, saying, "The maintenance schedule is slow," and some people said, "There is no land that can sleep (unsold)."
Deputy Mayor Yoshio Mizukami, who positioned it as an "industrial housing complex with the theme of tourism," said, "I would like to appeal the superiority of Katsuyama City with the prefectural dinosaur museum and ski jam Katsuyama at the forefront."

If you win, it is an important game where you can get a ticket to the Hokushinetsu tournament.
The only remaining Tsuruga Kihi at the seed school met with Hokuriku.
Tsuruga, who won a close match against Fukui Commerce in the quarterfinals, clashed with Hasui, who is currently riding the momentum of the tournament.
The first game, Kibi Tsuruga, has all won in the cold so far.
In the first round of the Asoba match, the pitching was a quick victory.
In the second round of the Takefu Industry, Naoki Kasajima, who was active in Koshien this summer, pitched five innings without scoring nine runs and three strikes and showing the scrupulousness of the ace.
The line was left alone in the 15th inning in the quarter-final three-park game, and he greeted Hokuriku with a perfect posture.

The North is gaining momentum with each game.
In the first round, he reversed the end against Fujishima and ran away with a point difference.
In the second round, he overcame the catch-up of Bikata, and also won by one point.
In the quarter-finals, the line exploded, breaking the seed Sakai in the cold.
The pitching is getting mixed up, and I want to get a ticket of Hokushinetsu with this flow.
[Team introduction] Hokuriku - a stroke line with explosive power
Tsuruga, who appears in the second game, has won in baseball, which defends and wins mainly with the battery.
In the first round of the Wakasa match, the pitchers stepped on and won with the least amount of points.
The second round of the war also scored two goals.
In the quarterfinals, it was a close match with Seed Fukui Commercial, but it should have strengthened his confidence by losing his ability school.
I also want to win the water battle with a solid defense as a weapon.
[Team introduction] Tsuruga - Battery axis win
On the other hand, Hamizu defeated the seeded Kodai Fukui in the first round.
When I got on with the momentum, I won the reverse victory with a swing of the fourth batter from a painful development in the game against Kinzu.
The director also says that "there is a destructive power" and the middle axis is also noteworthy in the semifinals.

Israel's "Messi II" contracted with his ninth club of a career (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! News
Guy Aslin, who joined Barca at the age of twelve, was once referred to as "Messi II" because of his excellent play and style.
Now, twenty-eight-year-old Guy Aslin has joined a new team that will be his ninth professional career.
Talent Buried Kantera's Pearl
Now that Ansu Fati is attracting the attention of those around him, there are many falls in the world of football, and there is a very effective example of the warning that "there is no need to hurry".
Despite its exceptional technology, Aslin, who was abandoned by the luck needed to achieve success, signed a two-year contract with Poly Yasi, who belongs to the Romanian Premier League.
The team, which is blue and white, is currently in fifth place in the league.
Guy Aslin made his top-flight debut for Barça at the age of 18 and six months against the Copa del Rey Kurtural Leonesa in the 2009/10 season.
However, after the end of the season, he canceled his contract with Barca, and from there Aslin's long journey began.

Darvish sum up this season "It is good in the stage in my life so far" (Higashi Spo Web) - Yahoo! News
[From St. Louis, Missouri 27th (Japan time 28th)]
The possibility of playing in the playoffs disappeared, and the Cubs' pitcher, 33, who finished this season's pitching board, told the interviewer, "I haven't done anything for about two days. However, it's boring to watch baseball (from the bench) with no purpose."
He started 31 games this season, with six wins and eight losses, a defense rate of 3-98, but he threw 178 2/3 innings and struck out 229.
Especially in the second half, the pitching form was stable, and he continued to play with the opponent's batter with outstanding control power and overwhelming ball power.
"It's definitely a good thing in my life now. I was thirty-three years old, and I didn't think I'd feel that way. In spring, I was thinking, 'I wonder if I'm going to end up like this,' but I can't believe that I was able to come back and get to a better position."
Since the beginning of June, I have been gradually getting a response.
“There are more things I can do every day, and more and more things I can do every day.”
There was trial and error, but by challenging the hypothesis that I had established one after another, the state of affairs improved dramatically, and along with that, my grades improved.
"He was thrown without being on the injured list throughout the year" also gave me confidence.
Darvish, who has the right to opt-out of the contract after the end of this season, said, "I have to think about it from now on. I will talk to my agent and family," but "Basically, there is no dissatisfaction with this team, and it is fun."
I haven’t come to a final conclusion, but my feelings seem to be getting stronger.

<One year after the Eastern Iburi Earthquake> Securing water even in the event of a power outage "Watering water faucet" directly connected to the water pipe will be installed in Hakodate's condominium: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Version
Measures are underway at condominiums in Hakodate City, where water was cut off due to a blackout (blackout) due to the Eastern Iburi earthquake in September last year.
According to the Ministry of Waterworks and Sewerage of the City Bureau of Enterprises, seven condominium buildings have installed water-spatting futs in the year after the earthquake, which can emit water even if they are without a power.
There are about four hundred condominiums and private communal houses in the city that are watered in a "water tank type" that may be cut off in the event of a power outage, and the department is calling for consideration of measures.
There are two main types of water supply in houses: the "reception tank type" that stores water in the aquarium, such as underground or on the rooftop, and the "direct connection system" that directly supplies water directly from the city's water distribution pipe to each house.
In the aquarium type, even if the water pipe is not damaged, if the electric pump that pumps water from the receiving tank to each door from the receiving tank stops moving due to a power outage, the water supply will not be possible, and each house will be cut off.

The remaining non-disciplined seafood was two fish species, the Binosgai and Common Kasbe.
After the event, President Nozaki told the press that the timing of the full-scale operation was undecided.
In response to the treatment of water after purifying the contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, he said, “The discussion with the taste of keren is a problem. The position of opposition to ocean release remains unchanged,” he said, slamming remarks by former Minister of the Environment Yoshiaki Harada and Mayor Ichiro Matsui of Osaka City.

Is "beauty and ugly" a piece of paper?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Kazuo's work (MAGMIX) - Yahoo! News
Do the mysterious beauty and the shadowed expression have in common?
Since the 1950s, he has released a number of works, and the "Kazuo Kado-Bishojo Collection" (Genkosha), which focuses on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Kazuo, who is known as the first figure of "Fear Manga", was released in August 2019.
When I look at it in my hand, I realize again that there is a correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo's work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a "shadow"?
楳図かずお Beautiful girls of the work (five pieces)
In the introduction of "Bishojo Collection", there was a sentence that "fear and ugliness, and the shocking scenes of the story and the beauty of the girls who are the opposite, and the development of the story stand out", but because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face being distorted, the expression of resentment with resentment ... ...
There is a keyword "snake" that appears a lot in Kazuo's work, but snakes are regarded as "eerie creatures" by the viewer, and there are people who feel "beautiful", and there are various ways of receiving.
Some people like reptiles, and some people don’t like them.
In this way, depending on the sensibility of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly" may be the creatures that are two sides of the same coin.
In addition, this creature has been revered as a creature with a high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house where the “white snake” lived is said to be auspicious.
There are "Hebibi Girl" and "Murata no Shojo" (Girls of the Horn) series.
For the most part, it is a market that a beautiful woman with a shadow is a market to be a "snack woman".
In a way of saying it, I think it should be said that it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... I feel that it is the common point of the beautiful girls who appear in the 楳図 work.
Among them, "Orochi", the main character of "Orochi" which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be a representative of the work of the 楳図 work, but it is reminiscent of a "snake" somewhere, such as a deep sleep every hundred years to preserve eternal life and eternal youth, and the part with mysterious power.

Deputy Minister Yamamoto deletes meal tweets The night before the explanation of the cause of the helicopter crash|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
Deputy Minister of Defense Tomohiro Yamamoto posted a comment along with a photo of Mr. Kazuka Iwata, Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense, and deleted the Twitter screen
Deputy Defense Minister Tomohiro Yamamoto deleted a Twitter comment by the 27th, writing "It's delicious" when he ate at a yakitori restaurant in Saga Prefecture.
Mr. Yamamoto entered the province on the 26th to explain to the local government the results of the accident that the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's AH64D combat helicopter crashed in February last year in Kanzaki City.
On the same night, he tweeted, “I came to Saga Prefecture on a business trip!”
Along with a photo of Kazuka Iwata, a member of the prefectural government's elected political affairs officer, who attended the meal, he posted comments such as "It's delicious."

Mr. Yamamoto was elected to the House of Representatives four times and was elected to the proportional south Kanto region.
[Wakamizu Koshiyama] The circle of "children's cafeteria" that provides free or inexpensive meals to children is spreading all over the country.
According to research by NPOs, about 3700 locations across the country are active this year.
It has increased by one-sixfold compared to 2018, and there are twenty-four locations in Fukui Prefecture, an increase of nine locations from last year.
Why is it a children's cafeteria now?
Mr. Makoto Yuasa, the president of the NPO and a social activist, talked about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area became lonely, and the shopping district also declined.
There is no place for people to meet.
Therefore, "There was a need for a regional exchange base where people and people were busy interacting"
▼Even if it is a children's cafeteria, it is a "multi-generational exchange place" where elderly people also participate.
Not only does it eliminate solitary eating, but it also leads to child-rearing support and the health of the elderly.
Break the cycle of poverty and revitalize the region.
The important thing is not to have children who are stunned from there.
▼From once a month to places where meals are served every day.
The scale ranges from several to several hundred people, and the venue is diverse from private houses to temples.
There is an atmosphere that people can do.
The low level of the threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management costs and staff.
We may also hear challenges such as a safe management system.
However, Mr. Yuasa said, “When you interact with many people, your values will change,” and “Connecting with society is a safety net in the event of a disaster.”
It seems to be a glimmer of hope in a closed society.

"The real culprit" who attacked Saudi Arabia's oil facility with a drone (FRIDAY) - Yahoo! News
“The Iranian-made drone “Abbair” used in this bombing has dramatically improved in performance by analyzing the crashed U.S. drone in recent years.
It is inexpensive and can be manufactured, and the range is about 1000km.
Because it is flying low in the sky, it is also a strength that it is difficult to be captured by radar."
On September 14, an oil facility at Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly after this, Yemeni rebels' Houthi statement of responsibility.
“There is no doubt that Iran is behind the Houthis, led by President Rouhani. Iran cannot allow its hostile Saudi Arabia to make money from oil in a situation where it is unable to export crude oil. The aim is to let the international community know that if the oil embargo on Iran continues to be accompanied by the pain that will be accompanied by it,” said Ide Sugawara, an international political analyst.
In the wake of the bombing, oil production in Saudi Arabia as a whole halted, and oil prices soared by 15 percent.
As it stands, there are voices that the oil shock will return.
“As long as Trump has pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East, at least until next year’s election is over, we want to avoid military intervention at all costs. Now that we know that Iran will continue to bomb the Houthis in secret. However, the United States cannot stand it forever. There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future.”
The "surrogate war" between the U.S. and Iran is now in a slumping crisis.
That’s why a super-personal YouTuber has become a full-time employee.
Ask the president who hired him (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 PM
YouTuber is now extremely popular mainly among young people.
It is now uncommon for companies to use it for advertising their own products, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber recruitment" that hires them as a full-time employee in-house.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as DmMiX) is a company's main business of CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to “opt for a YouTuber”?
We interviewed Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, the representative director of DmMiX and a representative of the subsidiary and staff first, which actually adopted YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber recruitment
How does “YouTuber adoption” work in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): The profession of YouTuber has become a longing for many young people.
Elementary school students are also ranked high in the ranking of occupations they want to get in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will continue to increase in the future.
Until now, we have hired and supported young people who are chasing their dreams such as bandmen and comedians.
In the same way, "YouTuber recruitment" is to recruit young people who are chasing their dream of becoming a YouTuber and to support them.
Q: When you think of YouTubers, there is an image that individuals voluntarily post videos. Why did you decide to “reploy”?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers can't make the profits they thought they would be.
There are many creators who are working part-time while making videos and posting, and creators who are not recognized as YouTubers by their families.
In this initiative, we will provide the creators who have hired an environment for salary and content creation.
At first, we are thinking of supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, which inevitably becomes an unstable position, by supporting our activities.

"I hope South Korea returns to GSOMIA" - U.S. Assistant Secretary of State (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for U.S. Affairs (South Korea and Japan) said in an exclusive interview with the Sankei Shimbun newspaper at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo on Monday that he hoped South Korea would reconsider its decision to destroy and return to the GSOMIA, which expires on November 23rd.
It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to refer to the reconsider of the destruction of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA has been concluded by Japan, South Korea, Japan, the U.S., and the United States, respectively, and is the basis for sharing missile launch information.
South Korea will notify the government of abandoning the agreement with Japan in August, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military intelligence in Japan and South Korea will collapse.
Mr Napper insisted: "We can't effectively respond to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is still time until it expires," he said, urging South Korea's return.
He said that the joint flight drills conducted by China and Russia in July were also “the first time in history” and that “it is essential for the United States, South Korea, and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, to work together in a alliance relationship,” he said.
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-ROK relations “will hurt the national interests of the United States.”
“There is no intention to mediate,” he said, “and we will play a positive role so that Japan and South Korea can fill the gap.”

After being involved in the town development of Nagano, Kumamoto, and Tochigi, he arrived in Echizen City in April this year.
In connection with the city that produced Satoko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, he aims to create a town that makes use of picture books.
Mr. Muneda said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion around me that I knew for the first time when I lived in the city."
What attracted attention was the legend of Awara City, "The face of the bride's ogre".

"I forgot my hatred and returned it with compassion and kindness. I felt the origin of the faithfulness and kindness of the people of Fukui," said Mr. Soda.
Mr. Soda, who got a hint, repeated interviews with Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City early in his arrival for the original picture book, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" where a kind-hearted ogre couple and a boy appeared.
From June, he drew ten scenes with warm watercolors, taking advantage of his main job, and the materials of the picture book were available.
In addition, the cover of the picture book will be made of Japanese paper using Echizen washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
It will lead to opportunities for parents and children to enjoy the texture of Japanese paper by reading stories.
In preparation for the six-hundred-part publication, the target amount of donations is eighty-five million yen.
The deadline is October 25.
Mr. Soda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under historical Buddhist culture, can be proud of all over the country.
I want to convey what is true kindness and compassion that has been passed down from generation to generation to children through picture books."

The coat has been on sale since early September, a month earlier than usual, and sales this month have increased by ten percent compared to the previous year.
A company employee (19) = Asakuchi City = who visited the Kurashiki store (Hakuraku-cho, Kurashiki City) to buy a suit to wear for the coming-of-age ceremony, said, "The ceremony is still ahead, but I want to buy it before the tax increase."
Under the tax increase, the tax rate on food and beverages will be set as a fixture under the reduced tax rate system, so the home center and supermarkets will focus on daily necessities and sake.
At the Home Center's Time Takaya store (Kaneki, Naka-ku, Okayama City), a special corner loaded with large-capacity detergents and tissues is available near the entrance.
Sales of daily consumables increased by one to six times from the same month last year, and “if you don’t replenish them many times a day, you will be cut off” (store manager Seiya Shimizu).
A 63-year-old civil servant from the city who came to the store said, "I'm going to buy it anyway, so I'm going to take this opportunity," and bought a kitchen paper in bulk.
Tenmanya Happy Town Okanan Store (Chikko Shinmachi, Minami-ku, Tokyo) will also install a wagon loaded with detergents, toilet paper, disposable diapers, etc. at the event hall.
A 35-year-old company employee in the city said, "If you receive a point reduction from cashless payments, the burden will hardly change, so you will not rush to buy daily necessities."
Best Director of 2019Klopp "Best Director" to Honor the Biggest Enemy General (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! News
Jürgen Klopp, who won Best Director for The Best, reflected on his career in an interview and commented on the current situation.
What surprised the public in many comments was that it was about Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, his biggest rival in competing for the Premier League title.
Neymar's best friend Alves says, "His happiness is still in Barca ... "
After the awards ceremony, the German captain said, “I didn’t imagine anything so great. I’m very happy and proud to have won this award. It’s been a great few days for me. Thanks to my players, I’ve been able to win the award. The most important thing is the team.”
With regard to Guardiola, Klopp said, “I have a lot of respect for him.” “What can I say about him? He’s won a lot of titles. His style of play is exceptional. He’s the best manager I’ve ever played, and it’s an honour to be nominated with him and to be able to compete for the prize.”
He also mentions manager Pochettino and Tottenham.
“His last year was incredible. In many cases, if you don’t win the title, it won’t be memorable. We’ve built a team little by little and played in a great style.
Klopp said without hesitation about the best moments of the year: "It's a reversal in the game against Barcelona. Many experts and myself wouldn't have bet on us as much as a centimeter. With a 3-0 behind against a team with Messi and Suarez. It's like a death sentence. We had a small chance and we were able to make it. I couldn't believe it. Looking back, we might be able to say that we won the CL in this game. This game will be memorable for everyone."
After receiving a more personal question, Klopp concluded, “When I congratulated myself on winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and didn’t even know where I was. This time I didn’t like getting drunk because I was a person who was plagued by self-control obsession. I did the blessing of CL very modestly. I remember everything. If you lined up everyone in front of me, you might be able to tell the difference between everyone on the bus.”
Special specification car that introduced from craftsmanship to cutting-edge technology appeared in Lexus LC and IS (WEB CARTOP) - Yahoo! News
It is finished in a special one that further enhances the style and taste
Lexus has set up a special specification car of the luxury coupe "LC" and sporty sedan "IS" and will be released on October 1st (Tuesday).
[Photo] Interior of Lexus LC that stands out for its high quality
Special specification cars were developed based on the idea of "CRAFTED".
CRAFTED embodies the desire to create a new experience that shakes the heart by using all kinds of methods from craftsmanship to cutting-edge technology, reflecting on the people's feelings of Japanese aesthetics cultivated in rich nature and history, and the sensibility of feeling the ambiguous things that they want without words.
The LC's special specification car "PATINA Elegance" is based on the LC500 / LC500h, and adopts the Lexus's top-class genuine leather L-ANILINE seat, which combines durability while taking advantage of the softness and natural texture, and genuine leather steering using premium leather with a soft feel.
It was finished as a model that further enhanced the style and taste.
L-ANILINE carefully selects only the highest level of raw skin, and realizes softness with a color coat aimed at thin coating film by the process of flexibility over a long period of time and unique technology.
It improves the comfort of the body and the fit during the run.
Premium leather is also used for the steering wheel, and we are particular about making it so that you can feel the quality on your skin.
In addition, it was specially equipped with a scuff plate and a color head-up display that is metal-processed with Alcantara roof and laser etching, and the motif with overlapping L-shapes beautifully emerges.
The interior features a vivid patina brown, door trim, genuine leather seat, and a gorgeous brown combination color for the seat belt.
In addition, the stitching color utilizes two colors of light brown and dark brown with different lightness, and together with the texture that has been carefully selected, it expresses a high-quality and deep space.
The body color is three colors, including the terrain khaki mica metallic, sonic titanium, and graphite black glass flakes.
I want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina will be available in October.
The exact date has not been revealed, but it may be delivered on October 4th, right?
macOS Catalina release date may be October 4th?
The image above has been posted on Apple’s website in Denmark (now fixed).
The image certainly has the words “fra den 4. oktober” from October 4.
If it is an official website, the accuracy of this information seems to be high.
By the way, the most popular feature of macOS Catalina is Sidecar.
This is a function that treats the iPad as a sub-display of the Mac, and it is a function that was previously realized in the third-made app.
And since Sidecar is a genuine feature of Apple, it is expected to be better with more perfection (and response).
There are rumours of a next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first I want to experience this next generation of macOS to the fullest.
Sakura shrimp in the growth process Shizuoka City, etc. PT, water depth 290m shooting|SHIZUOKA SHIMBUN AT S
Sakura shrimp born this year who succeeded in shooting in the deep sea of Suruga Bay = 11th, off the coast of Kamahara, Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City (provided by "Yui Sakura Shrimp Project")
The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, a meeting of the Marine Industry Cluster Council of Industry and Industry, including Shizuoka City, has recently succeeded in photographing cherry shrimp, which is believed to have been born in the spawning season of this spring and summer, on the seabed at a depth of 290m in Suruga Bay.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the people involved want to lead to the ecological elucidation of the cherry shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photo was taken near the seabed about one and a half kilometers off the coast of Kamahara, Shimizu Ward, the same city.
We checked about 300 of them in the 17th minute.
During the day, the conventional knowledge that cherry shrimp in the deep sea "forms a certain flock on the seabed" has been reconfirmed.
The adult body is about 40mm long, and the individual that was reflected is about 23mm long.
We identified the spawning season by comparing it with seasonal data of the caught cherry shrimp.
For detailed analysis, we will ask Fujitsu Software Technologies, which make up the team, and Shizuoka College of Industrial Technology.
Project leader Keisuke Mizuno says, "We want to capture the living figure of individuals in the process of growth, including young shrimp."

The roof was covered with blue sheets, and some facilities were still being repaired, but half of the restaurants were able to reopen.
Kenji Mitani, a 34-year-old company employee from Sagamihara City who visited with his family, said with a smile, "I was worried about when it would reopen. I came to enjoy the potato digging event hoping to lead to the reconstruction."

[Bud Olympic race first half] World champion Kento Momota, strong Zhou Tensei is one step lead!
Men's Singles (Bud x Spi!
The Japanese national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Basel, Switzerland) in August, will compete in the China OP (Changzhou/Super1000), which opens on the 17th after finishing the training camp in early September.
Here, we look back at the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, when the Olympic race to participate in next year’s Tokyo Olympics began, and look forward to the men’s singles for the midfield (September to December) (text / badminton magazine editorial department).
The badminton Olympic race, which began in May, digested four top-ranked tournaments (over Super500) where top athletes competed at the time of the World Championship.
The two players who kept up their good performance in the first half of the tournament were Kento Momota, who won two of the four tournaments, and Chou Tiancheng of Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship, and Zhou Tensei won the Indonesia OP (S1000) and the tournament where he could earn high points of the "World Ranking Point" directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also dominates the Japan OP (S750).
The four tournaments that have been participating since May are the Sudirman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July), the Japan OP (July) and the World Championship (August).
Although the number is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that suppresses the burden on the body.
Since there was only one world championship in August, fatigue would not be greater than in the series.
Good results are required in the midfield, where the top tournaments will be held consecutively after September.
Taiwan's strong ace in the series.
Watch out for young people in Thailand!
Shu Tensei, who also won the top tournaments of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September, and won the championship.
A player who is physically strong and does not suffer from continuous battle.
Even if the tournament continues, there will be no big problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, by scoring high points in the first half, it would have been easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament to be played in the future.
Until last year, Zhou Tensei had the impression that he lacked explosive power, but with the increase in stability in terms of play this year, he was able to continue his good results firmly.
For Momota, who is ranked first in the world, it is likely to be a more troublesome opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, the results in the first half were achieved by Thai young ace Kantaphone and Sai Planice B of India. .
And they are three players of Anders Antonsen who are struggling alone as a European team.
Although Cantafon did not advance to the finals in the top tournament, he has the power to advance to the top, such as being in the top four in the two tournaments this season.
There is still a rough side, but the 20-year-old (21st on the 18th) who can rally on an equal basis with the top players seems to have a great potential to make a leap in the Olympic race.
Sai Planice B. also took a step out of India, which has good singles players.
Samir Barama, Planoy H.S. and Srikans Kidambi, who are lagged by injuries, will also be caught up in the future, so the Indian side after the midfield battle needs attention.
New Charges for Mobile Phones: Decrease in Prices in a Fair Competition: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Version
A new pricing plan for mobile phone companies was introduced in October with the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act.
However, it generally remained high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer that "there is room to lower about forty percent," and even though expectations were high for price reductions, there was no price competition.
The major factor is that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been postponed, and the oligopoly of the three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee structure that is easy to use due to fair competition.
I would like to see the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The revised law prohibits a set discount on terminal fees and communication fees.
This is because instead of selling the terminal fee at a discount, the communication fee was set to be high.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to maximize the device by half price.
However, both companies have a "SIM lock" that can not be used for other companies' lines for a hundred days.
NTT DOCOMO will only pay one-third of the device for subscribers of its own line.
All three companies seem to be continuing to "enclose" to prevent switching to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has announced a policy to require immediate cancellation.
Businesses need to respond quickly.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the failure to improve the network of base stations and other communications networks as planned.
It was expected to be a trigger for the price reduction competition, so it was a good appearance with a slender shoulder.
Was there a lack of sight?
The start time and price of the full-scale service are also not clear.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to work responsibly on your business.
The change in the price was triggered by the remarks made by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga.
Mr. Kan complained about the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think that the competition will start from now on. I do not think that it will be good at all as it is."
However, I do not think that "government-made price reduction" will distort the market and promote healthy competition.
Companies should develop a customer-oriented competition before they interfere with the government.
The pricing system of each company is very complicated and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the burden on consumers exceeds half the price, even though the device advertises such as "up to half price".
Companies themselves should try to explain politely and in an easy-to-understand manner so as not to create misunderstandings among users.
Withdrawal limit reduced to half a million yen Three Shinkin cash cards in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three Shinkin Bankes in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kita-Ise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on the 26th that they have decided to reduce the withdrawal limit by cash card in order to prevent the damage of special fraud.
For depositors over the age of seventy who hold cash cards of Kuwana Mie, Kitaise Ueno, and Kihoku, and have not traded more than a certain amount of withdrawals at ATMs (cash-checking machines) for the past three years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn in a day with a cash card will be half a million yen.
The Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and the Kita-Ise-Ueno Shinkin Bank will be downgraded on October 1st, and the Kihoku Shinkin Bank will be downgraded from November 1st.
In the prefecture, there have been many cases of special fraud cases in which cash cards and PINs are stolen from financial institutions and police personnel, etc., and ATMs are withdrawn, and Shinkin Bank officials say, "We want to protect the customer's important deposit in the most way possible."
Yokozuna Tsururyu and others transferred to the Mutsu room In the sudden death of the master of Izutsu|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
On the 27th, the Japan Sumo Association announced that with the death of Izutsu no Ogata (former Sekiwaki Reinbo), three sumo wrestlers from Izutsutsu's room, including Tsururyu Yokozuna, and one member of Tokoyama, transferred to Mutsu-no-ya.
The Mutsu room is the same as Izutsu-no-ya.
His master, Ochikata MUTSU (former Ozeki Kirishima), was born in Izutsutsu's room and was the sibling of the late Izutsu no chikata.
The head of Izutsu died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and others were temporarily in custody of the same family's Kagamiyama room, and the treatment of them was discussed in the future.
Twelve sumo wrestlers are enrolled in the Mutsu Room, including Mt. Kirima from Mongolia, which is the same as Tsururyu, and twelve sumo wrestlers as of the autumn location.
[Rugby World Cup] One shot and a brawl U.S. player's "face danger tackle" overseas ripples "insulting and sneaky play" (THE ANSWER) - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quils make rough play, former England squad 'not what we can call tackle'
The Rugby World Cup (World Cup) in Japan was the last in twenty countries on the 26th, and the United States, which made its last appearance in the 20th, lost to England by 7-45.
It was a black star launch, but the rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half caused ripples.
A one-shot exit in the form of adding a shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.
The actual scene was also released by overseas media with a video, and the former England national team player complained that it was “insulting and despicable play” and “not what can be called a tackle”.
[Video] "Insulting and sneaky play" and overseas ripples!
One shot, the two military players get in and get into a disturbance ... The actual moment of the "face danger tackle" played by the U.S. representative Quil
The warm battle has crossed the line.
It was the 29th minute of the second half that greeted them at 0-38.
It was a bit of a slump when England captain Farrell caught a pass on his side in the deep enemy line.
It was Quill who went to tackle this.
However, I raised my upper body instead of from the waist down, and I violently hit my body in the upper body.
As a result, the other person's head and the head come into contact, and it is in a shape that makes the head thrust.
Farrell was violently blown away and fell.
England players protested furiously trying to push Quill into a play that clearly lacks legitimacy.
Both players gathered at once and became an air of excitement.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill was sent off with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some of the crowd who wanted to play fair also heard the booing.
The local media "staff" of rugby's strongman New Zealand featured the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave with a despicable play, England wins quickly".
"Kill had a despicable shoulder charge on England star Farrell's face and was out of the box," the report said. "It was almost a brawl over by both players."
The article introduced the comments of former England international and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's insulting, it's despicable. It's not what you call a tackle. It's a sneaky play," he said.
The U.S., which lacked one player, managed to escape the defeat in the 81st minute with a try of intention.
However, Quill's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) released for the first time the names of 424 hospitals that it judged to be "lack of medical treatment results" among 1455 public hospitals nationwide and public hospitals such as the Red Cross.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the results of treatment of fourteen public and public hospitals ▽ National Hospital Organization Awara Hospital in Awara City ▽ Sakai City Mikuni Hospital ▽ Oda Hospital in Echizen Town ▽ Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town was targeted.
⇒ Four hospitals subject to reorganization "standards are strange"
In order to control medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging population, it is necessary to encourage reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions, so we decided to take unusual measures.
In October, the government requested a full-scale review of the reorganization and integration of the hospital, and will have a conclusion be reached by September next year.
There is no coercive power, but the local chiefs and residents are expected to be opposed because of the fear that familiar hospitals will disappear.
It was made public at a meeting on the same day.
The target hospital was 29 and 1% of the total, and many of the hospitals had relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the proportion was higher in order of Niigata (53 and 7%), Hokkaido (48, 6%), Miyagi (47, 5%), Yamaguchi (46, 7%), and Okayama (43, 3%).
The number of targets was the highest in Hokkaido, with 54, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on the data for FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare surveyed 1455 public and public hospitals that can respond to the “high acute phase” for seriously ill patients and the “acute phase” for general surgery.
Nine-point medical records, including cancer and emergency medical care, were analyzed and the need to disclose the name of the hospital by analyzing the location of competing hospitals within twenty minutes by car.
The target hospital will be considered for abolition or the transfer of some departments to other hospitals.
Medical expenses will skyrocket in the next twenty-five years, when all of the baby boomers are over the age of seventy-five.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a target of reducing the number of hospital beds in Japan to eleven hundred and eleven thousand.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are placed generously and medical expenses are charged, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people with high needs.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of beds.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a "regional medical care plan" that stipulates the number of beds required for twenty-five years.
The whole country is divided into 339 areas, where local governments and medical personnel are in talks, but many of the local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, making the discussion difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare hopes to revitalize the discussion by releasing the names of hospitals with poor performance.
Comprehensive drill of disaster prevention such as the assumption of Mt. Komagatake eruption Wide area with the participation of residents, for the first time in eighteen years (Video) : Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Version
On September 27th, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was held in the forest, Nanae, and Shikabe-cho in the Watarishima area of the island.
About four hundred people, including staff and residents of twenty organizations, including roads and three towns, participated.
This is the first time that the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council has held an evacuation plan that includes evacuation routes for residents in August.
The wide-area training for residents has been in place for eighteen years.
It is assumed that Mt. Komagatake erupted at 8:45am, and a mud stream reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption warning level was raised to five (evacuation), evacuation centers were opened in the forest and Nanae town, and residents moved with buses prepared by each town and vehicles of the roadside police.
Hundreds of thousands of students protest in Vancouver on school break and global warming measures (Minna no Keizai Shimbun Network) - Yahoo! News
About a hundred thousand citizens, mainly students who sympathized with sixteen-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27th to protest climate action.
Climate protests in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across the Canby Bridge to the downtown library.
People with placards began to gather in front of the city hall of the meeting place a few hours before the start, and at 13pm the start time, the number of people filled the road in front of the city hall several blocks.
Since then, the number of participants has increased, and eventually more than a hundred thousand people participated.
On the way, the police also cooperated with the road regulations, and for several hours everyone watched until they had finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, Vancouver has held many events to think about global warming since last weekend.
On the 27th of the last day, a school strike was held on Fridays for the future.
The students who took a break from school on this day and participated said, "I want to protect the earth even if I take a break from the important thing of the school," and many adults who took a break from work responded, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning and thinking."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on the 27th released a draft amendment to the epidemic prevention guideline that enables preventive vaccination of domestic pigs that are not currently recognized in order to prevent the spread of the spread of livestock infectious disease "pork cholera".
The policy is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi prefectures, where infections with pigs and wild boars have been confirmed.
The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted in the region, but it is permitted to distribute meat and processed products outside the region.
After making public comments (opinion solicitation) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing extraterritorial distribution such as meat, it will no longer be a "clean country" that has been certified by international organizations, and it may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak in September last year, Japan has been on hold for a while.
In the revised proposal, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has established a "vaccination recommended area" based on the opinions of experts on areas where the risk of infection from wild boars to pigs is high.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed, and after confirmation by the ministry, the governor will allow it to be used at the governor's discretion.
The other seven prefectures listed as recommended vaccinations are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will assess the situation and decide again.
In principle, the movement of vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses, excrement, etc. will be restricted to the region.
Meat and processed products will not be targeted in light of the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and will effectively allow distribution outside the region.
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, we will thoroughly dispose of food waste.
We will also work to prevent harmful rumors by calling for the safety of vaccinated pigs.
The draft amendments to the guidelines were compiled at a meeting of the expert panel held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Anti-epidemic Headquarters.
In the future, opinions will be made to prefectures and public comments until October 7th, and new epidemic prevention guidelines will be implemented.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Honda, open approach to Man U!
"Please make an offer. You don't need the money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57pm Delivery
He left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League only last season, and now an independent former Japan international midfielder Keisuke Honda has taken a surprising action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, were you actually in the game?
The truth of heaven will be revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account late at night on the 27th, said, “Please make an offer, you don’t need the money, but you need to play with a great team or a great teammate,” and gave a public approach to a club.
The person who sent the "reverse offer" was Manchester United, a world-renowned rank.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the strongest clubs in the Premier League?
The story is based on the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on the 24th.
In an article titled "Five FWs that Manchester United may grab in the midst of a continuing injury crisis, five unaffiliated players who can currently be acquired were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben-Alpha, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfred Bonnie, Honda's name was also there.
Currently, there are injuries at United, including midfielder Paul Pogba, DF Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, FW Antony Martial and FW Marcus Rashford, which is in an emergency.
The "red devil" led by manager Ole Gunnar Sulchar was forced to make a painful start with two wins and 22 losses in the league, and has a problem with the quality of the front line.
Therefore, it was Honda that the Australian media named him as a candidate for a new force to put in the tsuke.
The article analyzed that "Honda's contract as a player on the creative side, not a striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Pereira fills."
“It’s a solid record,” he said, “but the 33-year-old Honda needs to get out of his entertainment to manage the Cambodian national team and get full attention.”
Will Honda's approach be real?
It will also be interesting to see if United will move for veterans who will profess their goal of participating in next year's Tokyo Olympics.
Completed installation of 500 portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Stores|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
"Poke Talk" is a portable translation machine that is loaned free of charge to stores in Hamamatsu City.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on the 26th that it has completed the installation of a total of five hundred units at stores in Hamamatsu City, etc., in a business that lends mobile-type translation machine "Poketalk" to member offices free of charge.
It is said that it is the first time in Japan that the translation machine will be deployed intensively in the same area, and it will be interesting to see if it will lead to the improvement of the ability to respond to inbound tourists (visiting tourists).
The loan destination is 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
The city's middle district accounts for six per cent.
We also started displaying the loan destination to the map application "Google Map", and made it possible to know the location of "stores that support foreign languages" with a smartphone.
It can be accessed from the website of Lake Hamana sightseeing area.
The free loan of Poketalk, which supports 74 languages, was launched in April in response to the declaration of "Japan's best inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase five hundred units and rent them out for two years to small and medium-sized business establishments that meet the requirements such as obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
A representative from the Chamber of Commerce said, "We hope that this will lead to the development of new customers for foreigners in a difficult business environment."
Now Naodora master Hiroyo Ikemura does not need to tip up the first shot?
Today's Caddy's Best Shot
A 1W shot is not always a tie-up and a hit.
There is also a technique called "Naodora" that knocks a ball on the ground when you want to earn distance with the second shot of the par5.
Recent 1Ws have a risk of the ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who frequently practice this on the ti-ground.
It is Hiroyo Ikemura who is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a professional, is 166cm tall and small, but currently ranked 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of the fairway wood.
In early spring, "I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W), so I thought I'd try direct drama."
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the grass of the ti-area, and 1W is shaken off.
In cases where big carry is required, tea-up is often used, but both sides are effectively used in narrow halls.
“You can use it in a hall where your eyes are slashed down.”
In the ballistic measuring instrument, 270yd to 280yd is recorded with carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W. I can feel more secure than my caddie 3W. .
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, there is only 1W of wood in the caddie bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17C UT.
I am also happy to hear the admiration that is leaked from the gallery that I saw, as a strategy that is surprised by my tour friends.
The trick is to "wave the club to the level (level)".
“Even if you hit it with a down blow, you don’t fly straight. If it’s a cut trajectory, go to the right. Originally, I was doing direct dora to correct the swing of 1W shot (at the time of tee-up). With this practice, the attack angle (the entrance angle of the club) will also be moderate.”
The ball is not caught, and it carries the risk of slicing, but "so the left side can be erased (does not turn left)".
I say to Canada, but it is a professional technique that makes me feel unintentional.

Shuri "This time is the fulfillment of love ... " Yuko Araki & Kengo Kora starring Fuji Rendra "Motokaremania" will appear (sports report) - Yahoo! News
Actress Shuri (29) will appear in Fuji TV's new drama "Motokaremania" starring Yuko Araki (25) and Kengo Kora (31) (starting on October 17, Thursday, 10 o'clock).
Shuri plays Chizuru Kaga, a colleague of a major food manufacturer where Akio Yamashita, played by 38-year-old Kenta Hamano, works.
The original character of the drama, Chizuru, who does not appear in the original, is not interested in marriage, and marriage is a "means" to avoid financial problems.
It was the mountains that appeared there.
Seeing the future that has prospered from Hokkaido to the Tokyo headquarters, which rarely exist, and the way to eat rice is beautiful, he approaches "just the right marriage partner".
Chizuru seems to have a strong mentality, but in fact, his mentality is weak like tofu.
In order to develop a love strategy that does not hurt, it is violently upset if things do not carry as expected.
Chizuru, who lives with a slump, meets Yurika and Yamashita, played by Yuko Araki, and the changing of the relationship is drawn.
This is the first time that Shuri, who has appeared in many popular works such as NHK's serial TV novel "Toto Ane-chan" (April-October 2016) and TBS series "Black Pean" (April 2018), will appear in Fuji-kei terrestrial dramas.
Shuri said, “I have many roles that don’t make love bear fruit, so I hope that this time (love) will be fulfilled (laughs).” I would like to play with the cast full of individuality and charm, the staff, and I am looking forward to how I can create this world of “Motokaremania”. I would be happy if it would be a drama that I can look forward to every Thursday at 10pm.”
In addition, it was decided that Kuto Okura (17) would play Chizuru's junior new employee, Hattori Bo.
Okura, the youngest of the regular cast members, shows a fresh performance full of youth.
GQ MEN's Ten-Day-Day9 "Skateboarding with Friends" (GQ JAPAN) - Yahoo! News
The means of transportation is all skateboarding!
I've been addicted to it since I was invited by a friend and started skiing.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to run through the asphalt with a push.
Philson's hunting jacket is convenient because you can put your smartphone, wallet, or luggage in it and become hands-free.
If it is shorts, you can feel the wind directly and it feels good.
At the foot, of course, it is light with Converse skate shoes.
The fashion and culture around the skateboarding are also cool, so check magazines and Instagram frequently!
I also started going to a salon run by a skater's hairdresser in Yutenji.
They taught me a lot of tricks that I couldn't do yet, skateboarding park information, and I was inspired by it.
After school, it is our daily routine to walk around the city with skateboards with friends.

Greta Toonberi: “Why do adults laugh and threaten children?”
Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech on September 23rd at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.
While the speech is attracting attention, there are messages that insult Greta.
Greta Toonbergi: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
A political commentator said on an American television program that she was “silently ill. It was being used by her parents and the international left,” and the TV station he used apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on Mr. Greta, such as "I'm poor that I'm using it" and "It's better to go to school", and so on, and I'm not commenting on the part that Mr. Greta's remarks.
On September 26th, Greta posted on Twitter, “Why do adults spend their time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?”
“I come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as I can think of.”
Greta said, “Look, it’s started again. As you’ve noticed, the people who hate me are still active. They follow my looks, my clothes, my attitude, and where I’m different from other people. They come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as they can think of.”
He pointed out that adults do not want to face the climate and environmental crises, but they seem to be swaying the topic.
To be honest, I don’t understand why adults spend their time laughing and threatening teenage young people and children.
You can do something else in that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don’t spend any more of your time paying attention to them.
The world is beginning to wake up.
Change is coming.
Even if the adults don’t like the change.
See you on the street on Friday!
On the 20th, the previous Friday, there were strikes on climate change in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta had also called for the event to be held on Friday the 27th.

Garcia's wedge shot
I was able to stretch it to some extent in the first half, so I thought that I could go with that momentum in the second half, but the putter was not good and I could not stretch it, so I was frustrated there.
Did you see the winner with the Eagles in the 6th and the 7th birdies?
Even after hitting the bogey in the fourth, there was also a par five, so I was doing it with the feeling of getting it back, and the chip-in eagle came in at the 6th.
Even in the 7th, I was able to get a chance with a birdie, but after all I was disappointed that I could not stretch in the second half.
What did you get at the meeting?
I haven't been feeling well lately, so it was good that I was able to keep the fairway firmly even on a narrow course.
The rough was also a course where the way of hitting and the distance changed because the rough is also different from the order and the opposite eyes are different, so I did not have much (experience), so I learned a lot.
How is it different from a regular meeting?
It was possible to shoot with a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't mind at all, but the gallery was quite a bit of a video.
Other than that, there were not many things that changed, but it was just a tournament where there were few Japanese players co-hosted, so I went to the game with the feeling that "I can not lose to overseas players".
The second half of the race will continue, but if you do not win more than one win, you can not aim for the prize money king, so I want to give another win, and there is a ZOZO championship up close, so I will do my best to get to the top in the tournament so far and get qualified.
How to prevent dementia and keep it to the degree of "forgetting"?
Interview / Text / Yo Watanabe (Yoshi Watanabe)
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are struggling with research and development, and drugs for dementia are frustrated.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that it is possible to keep it to a very mild illness and forgetfulness.
We spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Stroke Center at Kinki University Hospital.
Dementia will not disappear
Dementia prevention or treatment is expected, but what is the current situation?
Otsuki From mild to severe, regardless of the degree of difference, everyone may have dementia as they age.
However, it is believed that it will still take more than 20 years for new dementia drugs to be developed.
Donepegil, a drug that is often used in Japan, is already out of insurance coverage in some countries overseas, and we can not expect a noticeable cure effect.
On the other hand, as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have also decreased due to remarkable advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs, and people can live longer.
As a result, the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the person or a family, but it is necessary to create an environment where society as a whole can live with peace of mind in the community.
How to keep it to the extent of "forgetting things"
Are there people who are prone to dementia and people who are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable that you will have dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep it to the extent that you forget.
Dementia is considered to be one of the lifestyle diseases, and there is a tendency for people who are prone to becoming.
First of all, people with metabolic syndrome tend to be more prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered a lifestyle disease.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the lack of economic power.
For example, there are regions in the United States that distribute food vouchers to the poor, but the food you can get with food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chicken that can be stored.
It can be used by people who can't use gas or electricity, and they can live in an environment where they can't cook in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased toward lipids and carbohydrates.
Eventually, you will become poor, but you will become obese, and the only thing you can do is to watch TV, and your body will be disabled.
A similar situation can be found in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think or work tend to have dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books and think about things on a daily basis, which is not metabolic.

Jaguar F-PACE to make big improvements for the first time ... the possibility of hybridization (response) - Yahoo! News
Jaguar’s first crossover SUV, the F-PACE, has been captured for the first time by a camera in southern Europe.
The F-PACE originated with the C-X17, a four-seater concept SUV first unveiled in 2013.
Then, in 2014, a five-seater version was released, and he officially debuted as "F-PACE" at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2015.
The next year, the first model was released, and this is the first facelift.
The prototype is covered with thick camouflage, but you can see some of the new design.
The headlights are more compact and thinly designed, and the side air intake seems to have been modified to a sporty oval.
The grille is completely disguised, but there is no doubt that it will be redesigned.
In the rear end, you can see part of the revamped tail light, which is equipped with an elongated reverse light at the top.
It seems that the design that goes around the side as well as the current model has been modified compactly.
The cabin is expected to be equipped with the company’s “Pivi Pro” touchscreen infotainment system, as well as a new digital cluster, HVAC control screen, steering wheel, and gear selector.
The powertrain is expected to have a hybridized 3.0-liter series six-cylinder indinium setting, in addition to 2.0-liter in-line four-cylinder turbodiesel.
The world premiere is likely to be in 2020.

Prior to the opening ceremony, an opening ceremony was held at the same small school, and about a hundred people from the people involved attended.
Mayor Masao Omori, the chairman of the executive committee, and Yasuharu Ishikawa, general producer, said, "The intellectual sensibility is stimulated, and the imagination and creativity are stimulated. If it becomes an exhibition that attracts attention from the world," he said, and cut the tape.
Family members and children studying outside the school, who immediately visited, looked at the snake-shaped robot that twists the body in response to the surrounding sound in the danger of the schoolyard, and toured the school building that changed to the stage of a video work that depicts the world three thousand years later.
I was enjoying the art that brought me to another world.
A 15-year-old high school student in Tokyo, who is traveling with his father, said, “The works that make use of the atmosphere of the old school building are interesting. I imagine the time that flowed to this place.”
Closed on Mondays (or the following day if Monday is a national holiday) until November 24th.
