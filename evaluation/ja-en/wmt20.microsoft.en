Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Accidents involving young people stepping on the wrong pedal occur frequently (Auto Messe Web) --Yahoo! News
Violations that violate the Road Traffic Act
There have been more and more reports of accidents caused by mishandling of pedals, but it would be a big mistake to think that this is a problem only for elderly drivers.
According to the 2015 National Police Agency data, the largest number of accidents involving pedal misstepping by age group was 1,080 for those aged 24 or younger, exceeding the 1,032 accidents for those aged 75 and over.
Missteps are not common among the elderly, and it is important to call attention to young people as well.
Do you want to dress up on your feet?
Do you take safety?
The data does not describe the gender ratio or causes, but unlike the elderly, who are often thought to be due to physical deterioration such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may make inadvertent mistakes due to distractions such as music or conversation, or may make mistakes due to clothing.
Women, in particular, choose a variety of shoes depending on what they are wearing that day, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, and some people drive as they are.
Some people find it troublesome to change their shoes even though they know they are not suitable for driving, but there are many people who drive without any ill will, not thinking about the possibility of danger at all.
However, driving in high heels or sandals is a violation of the Road Traffic Act.
The first is Article 70, which stipulates that "the driver must operate the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations reliably" and "the driver must not drive in a way that causes an accident and harms others."
The other is Article 71 "Violation of the Public Safety Commission's Compliance Matters," which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety commission, for example, Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law Enforcement Detailed Regulations states, "Wearing bald, slippers, hooks, high heels, or other footwear that may interfere with driving operations, or wearing footwear in a way that interferes with driving operations, and using a vehicle (excluding light vehicles). Don't drive. There is a sentence that says.
Each prefecture has the same intent to consider driving in "footwear that may interfere with driving operations" as a violation, even if it is not specified as high heels.
So why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?
This is obvious when you consider the basics of safe pedaling.
In order to operate the pedal safely and reliably, first fix the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot so that it is perpendicular to the brake pedal, and tilt the toe to the right using that as a fulcrum when stepping on the accelerator pedal.
At this time, regardless of the behavior of the car, it is important to keep the heel firmly fixed so that it does not shake.
However, with high heels, the area where the heel touches the floor is small, and it always wobbles, and because the entire foot is angled at the height of the heel, the area of the foot that touches the pedal is also small, making it difficult to step firmly and make fine adjustments.
This is considered to lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have a floor carpet, but the heel of the high heel is easily caught in this material, and when braking suddenly, the heel may get caught and the pedal may not be able to be pressed, or the high heel may come off when the heel is caught and may be caught in the back of the pedal and cannot be stepped on.
In addition, there have been cases where the heel caught on the back of the pedal when returning after pressing the pedal, and the accelerator pedal could not return.
Toyota to make Subaru an equity-method affiliate to accelerate joint development of new AWD vehicles and the next 86 / BRZ model (response) --Yahoo! News
On September 27, Toyota Motor Corporation and Subaru agreed to a new business and capital alliance.
Toyota will acquire additional shares of Subaru and make it an equity-method affiliate.
Since agreeing on a business alliance in 2005, the two companies have been working on collaboration, including contract production of Toyota vehicles by Subaru, the supply of vehicles from Toyota to Subaru, and the joint development of the 86 and BRZ FR sports cars.
In June this year, the two companies also agreed to work on the development of a dedicated EV platform and EV vehicles utilizing Subaru's all-wheel drive (AWD) technology and Toyota's electrification technology.
Under the terms of the business and capital alliance, Toyota will acquire additional shares in Subaru.
Currently, Toyota owns 16.83% of Subaru's voting rights, but it will acquire additional shares until it reaches 20%.
Subaru will be an equity-method affiliate of Toyota.
Subaru, on the other hand, will acquire shares in Toyota equivalent to the amount required by Toyota to acquire Subaru shares (up to 80 billion yen).
The two companies will develop and strengthen their cooperative relationship through a business and capital alliance.

U.S. Lowest Refugee Acceptance Quota for 3rd Consecutive Year, 18,000 People|Shizuoka Shimbun
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. State Department announced on Monday that it will reduce the maximum number of refugees accepted from around the world to 18,000 in fiscal year 2020 (Oct. 19 ~ Sep. 20).
This is the third consecutive year that the number of refugees has been the lowest since the Refugee Act was enacted in 1980.
The Trump administration is aiming to appeal to conservatives with its strict immigration and refugee policies in anticipation of next year's presidential election.
As people continue to flee their countries in many places, it is inevitable that there will be criticism from human rights groups and others.
The former Obama administration set the upper limit at 110,000 for FY17, but the Trump administration, which was inaugurated in January 2017, overturned this and reduced it to 50,000.
The number has been decreasing year by year, from 45,000 in FY18 to 30,000 in FY19.

"D-8" The Olympic flame of the 100th National Sports Festival burned on Dokdo = Korea (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese version) - Yahoo! News
At Dokdo (Japan name, Takeshima), the easternmost point of the Republic of Korea, the Olympic flame was lit to announce the 100th National Sports Festival.
At 6:30 a.m. on the 26th, the Seoul Metropolitan Government held a torch lighting ceremony to commemorate the National Sports Festival at the landing site of the Dokdo Guard's helicopter puta in Ulleung-gun, North Gyeongsang Province.
It has been 15 years since the 85th National Sports Festival was lit in Dokdo since the 85th edition of the Games held in Chungbuk in 2004.
Following the kite-flying performance to pray for peace, Kim Sung-hwan, vice chairman of the Seoul City Council, read out the proclamation.
"I stood on Dokdo to remember the past 99 years of the National Sports Festival and honor the strong will of the national self-determination," Kim said, adding, "100 years ago, our people made a glorious history of the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the government of the Republic of Korea, and we want to add the 100-year history of the National Sports Festival to that history."
The greetings of the head of Ulleung County also followed.
Kim Byung-so, the head of Ulleung-gun, said, "Recently, Japan has been tightening our economy for no reason and claiming Dokdo as its territory," and stressed that "all the people of Japan should come together to overcome this through this national sports festival."
Subsequently, Vice Chairman Kim and Chief Kim lit the torch together.
The flame was handed over to the first torchbearers, Heo Won-seok, the head of the Dokdo National Guard, and Oh Yo-se-ph, the head of the Seoul Metropolitan Sports Promotion Division, who was the leader of the torch undertaker.
The Dokdo Torch Lighting Event was scheduled for the 21st, but it was postponed to this date due to Typhoon No. 17.
Captain Heo Won-seok, who has been working in Dokdo since January this year, said, "It's lonely and difficult, but I'm working with a sense of pride that no one can protect our territory," adding, "I'm honored to be able to participate as a torch relay runner on Dokdo Island to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Sports Festival."
Captain Ho inherited from the helicopter puta landing site to the middle of Dokdo, and O's from the halfway point to the dock.
The flame will be moved to Ulleungdo Island, where Ulleungdo residents Kim Seong-ho and Kim County Leader will travel to Seoul in succession at the Guanyungdo Bridge.
The flame began on the 22nd at Jamseongdan in Ganghwa Island.
As this is the 100th time, the torch relay will also be the largest in history.
The flame will travel to Incheon, Goyang and Suwon.
The Ganghwa Island flame will be combined in Seoul Square on the 29th of this month, along with special lighting held at Imjingak, Marad and Dokdo, and then will burn as a single firework.
On the other hand, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon explained in a media briefing on the 25th that "we are in an era where the power of collective intelligence is important, not just a few heroes," and that "for that reason, we have decided to use 'many stars' as the basic concept of the National Sports Festival."
South Korea-Bulgaria summit meeting Discussion on measures to expand cooperation such as nuclear power plants and defense industries (Yonhap News) --Yahoo! News
SEOUL (Yonhap) -- South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Borisov, who is on an official visit to South Korea, at the Cheongwadae (presidential office) on March 27 to discuss ways to expand cooperation between the two countries.
This is the first visit by a Bulgarian prime minister to South Korea.
President Moon welcomed his visit to South Korea ahead of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year and highly appreciated Prime Minister Borisov's leadership in leading the development of Bulgaria.
The two leaders appreciated the continued increase in trade and investment between the two countries despite the spread of protectionism worldwide, and shared the view that they would work together to expand economic cooperation in the future.
President Moon welcomed Bulgaria's policy of granting the status of "strategic investors" to Korean companies, and said he hoped that this policy would promote investment by Korean companies in Bulgaria.
He also stressed that South Korea can be the best partner for Bulgaria as it pushes forward with the introduction of nuclear power plants and the modernization of national defense, and called for interest and cooperation for Korean companies to participate in the Bulgarian government's nuclear power plant order and the promotion of the defense industry.
In addition, the two leaders shared the view to strengthen future-oriented cooperation in the fields of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and auto components and renewable energy.
Prime Minister Borisov hoped that close cooperation would be carried out in the fields of information and communication technology (ICT), science and technology, and education, which South Korea is leading.
The peace process on the Korean Peninsula was also discussed, and President Moon expressed his gratitude for the ROK's support for the ROK government's efforts to consolidate peace on the Korean Peninsula, including Bulgaria's statement of support for the inter-Korean and U.S.-North Korea summits.
Prime Minister Borisov appreciated President Moon's will and the efforts of the South Korean government to build a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, and reiterated the Bulgarian government's firm support.
The meeting was attended by Minister of Industry, Trade and Energy Sung Yoon-mo, Lee Ho-seung, Chief Economic Secretary of the Presidential Office, and Kim Hyun-jong, Second Deputy Director of the National Security Office.
On behalf of Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha during his visit to the United States, First Vice Minister Cho Se-yong of the Ministry also attended.
Local industry on Hyogo, Awaji Island, Ceramics, which manufactures "Awaji tiles", filed for quasi-bankruptcy debt of about 2 billion yen (Teikoku Databank) --Yahoo! News
The sluggish housing market and repeated earthquake damage also had an impact on the fact that consumers were moving away from tile roofs
Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB company code: 530173983, capital: 99.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji-shi, Hyogo Prefecture, CEO: Kozo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-bankruptcy at the Kobe District Court on August 30.
The applicant is represented by Daichi Yoshida (Daichi Yoshida Law Office, 1-10-8 Nishitenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka, Japan, Tel: 06-6365-6038) and one other person.
Our company was founded in June 1895 (Meiji 28) and reorganized as a corporate company in April 1961 (Showa 36).
Initially, under the trade name of Ceramics Co., Ltd., we started our business as a manufacturer of Ibushi tiles, a local industry on Awaji Island, in Nishitan Town, Mihara County (now Minamiawaji City).
In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and took over the business of Sangyo Co., Ltd., and at the same time, changed its trade name to its current name and moved its head office to its current location.
Subsequently, sales offices were opened in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and the current system was established, and in the past, the company mainly manufactured Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer needs, it is now 70% Western tiles such as flat plate tiles and 30% Japanese tiles such as Ibushi tiles.
The company has built a broad sales base mainly in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building material trading companies, and roofing contractors, and posted annual sales of approximately 3,116 million yen in the fiscal year ended December 2004.
It had a reasonable name recognition as the top tile manufacturer on Awaji Island.
However, during this period, demand was sluggish due to the sluggish housing market after the Lehman shock and the repeated damage caused by earthquakes such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, which led to sluggish demand growth, and annual sales in the fiscal year ended December 2018 fell to approximately 1.345 billion yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to a decline in profit margins due to soaring fuel prices, the company was forced to run a series of losses due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and capital investments, and was forced to raise funds in a difficult financial position.
For this reason, although the company was trying to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to relax the repayment conditions of its loans, there was no sign of recovery in the business situation and the cash flow gradually tightened.
When I came here, I couldn't support myself and gave up on continuing the business, and this measure was taken.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be about 2 billion yen.
Prefectural Dinosaur Museum in Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture, which is promoting the "industrialization of tourism" (aerial photography of Japan, photographed by a small unmanned aerial vehicle drone)
On September 25, Katsuyama City, Fukui Prefecture, announced its intention to acquire approximately 25,300 square meters of land (Arado Town, Fukui Prefecture) adjacent to the construction site of the roadside station "Dinosaur Valley Katsuyama" that will open next spring.
In order to accelerate the "industrialization of tourism" advocated by the city and the local business community, the city aims to attract hotels and restaurants specializing in lodging.
On the same day, the director explained at a special committee meeting of the city council to develop a base for attracting customers.
In addition to the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen in the prefecture in the spring of 2023, the opening of the entire section of the Chubu Shikankan Expressway in the prefecture, and the expansion and renovation and enhancement of the functions of the prefectural dinosaur museum (Katsuyama City), the city wants to promote a shift from day-trip tourism to stay-type tourism and attract accommodation facilities as a center.
The land to be acquired is idle private land located to the east of the roadside station construction site.
Surrounded by the Kuzuryu River, the Takinami River, and prefectural roads, it is more than twice the size of a roadside station (about 12,000 square meters).
Under the pretext of industrial park development, the Municipal Land Development Corporation will proceed with land negotiations from this fiscal year, and after acquiring land, the land will be developed in FY21.
According to the city, it has already been approached by private businesses such as farmhouse restaurants and harvesting facilities, fast food, and restaurants.
As for accommodation facilities, Sekisui House also revealed that it has put its name forward as a city to attract hotels specializing in lodging adjacent to roadside stations, which are planned by Sekisui House in various parts of Japan.
Sekisui House plans to expand into three locations in Fukui Prefecture, but several other municipalities have expressed their intention to attract the company, and there is a possibility that they will compete.
In addition, the city is planning to develop a parking lot.
Some members of the committee called for a speed-up of the maintenance schedule, saying, "The maintenance schedule is slow," and others said, "We don't want to have any land that goes to bed (unsold)."
Deputy Mayor Mikio Mizukami positioned the area as an "industrial park with the theme of tourism" and expressed his intention to do his utmost to attract hotels and other facilities, saying, "I would like to promote the superiority of Katsuyama City by bringing the prefectural dinosaur museum, ski jam and Katsuyama to the forefront."

Israel's "Messi II" signed with the ninth club of his career (SPORT.es ) --Yahoo! News
Guy Aslin, who joined Barça at the age of 12, was once known as "Messi II" because of his brilliant play and style.
Fast forward and the 28-year-old has joined a new team, which will be the ninth club of his professional career.
The pearl of the cantera buried in talent
With Ansu Fati in the spotlight around him, there are a lot of downfalls in football, and there is a very effective example of a warning that "there is no need to rush".
Possessed of extraordinary skill but lack of the luck needed to achieve success, Aslin signed a two-year contract with Romanian First Division side Poly Yasi.
The team, which has blue and white team colors, is currently in fifth place in the league.
Guy Aslin made his senior debut for Barça in the 2009/10 season against Cultural Leonesa in the Copa del Rey at the age of 18 and a half.
However, at the end of the season, he terminated his contract with Barça, and from there began Aslin's long journey.
He never played for the same team for more than two seasons.
Manchester City, Brighton and Hove Albion (on loan from City), Racing Santander, Hercules, Mallorca, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Sabadel, Kairat Almaty and now Poli Yasi are the new clubs that have given the Israeli midfielder the opportunity to start his career again.

Darvish summarizes this season "It's much better than I've ever been in my life" ( East Sports Web ) --Yahoo! News
[From St. Louis, Missouri on May 27 (Japan time) on May 28]
Cubs pitcher Yu Darvish, 33, who finished his season with the possibility of a playoff berth, spoke to the media about his current state of mind, saying, "I haven't done anything for about two days, but it's boring to watch baseball (from the bench) with no purpose."
He started 31 games this season, going 6-8 with a 3.98 ERA, but struck out 229 in 178 2/3 innings.
Especially in the second half of the game, his pitching form stabilized, and he continued to toss opposing hitters with his outstanding control of the ball and overwhelming power.
"It's definitely the best I've ever done in my life, I never thought I'd feel that way at 33 years old. In the spring, I was like, 'This is how I'm going to end it,' but I feel like I can't believe I've come back from that and been in a better position."
From around the beginning of June, we gradually started to get a response.
"I was able to do more things every day, and I could do more things a day."
There was trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses I had set up one after another, my condition improved dramatically, and my grades improved accordingly.
"I was able to pitch all year without being on the injured list," which also gave him confidence.
Darvish, who has the opt-out right to terminate his contract at the end of this season, said, "I'll have to think about it, I'll talk to my agent and my family," but added, "Basically, I don't have any complaints about this team, I'm enjoying it."
He hasn't come to a final conclusion, but he seems to be making up his mind.

On the night of the 25th, the "Omachi Taromen Management Council" (represented by Kensuke Suzuyama), which is made up of stores that serve Omachi Town's famous noodle "Taromen", served "Taromen" at the town general welfare center Misato, which serves as an evacuation center for victims of torrential rains.
It is a soul food that has been loved since the time of the Kishima coal mine, and it cheered up the people affected by the disaster.
"The only thing we can do is make taro noodles and have them eat them," he said.
Four restaurants with taromen on their menus worked together to make 90 servings and bring them to the evacuation center with rice balls.
Thin udon noodles are added to the ginger-flavored beef bone broth, and plenty of ingredients such as pork head, shrimp, and vegetables are served.
Not only those who were sheltering in evacuation centers, but also those who came to the baths set up by the Self-Defense Forces were provided with a "taste of Omachi."
A 66-year-old man who said, "I've been a fan since I was young, but it's been a year since I ate it, and it reminds me of the old days," and another man who moved in about a year ago said, "I ate it for the first time. Delicious. I want to go out to eat at the restaurant next time," said the 20-year-old and 22-year-old siblings.
After the cooking was finished, Vice President Kenichiro Fujise also rushed to the scene and cheered up, saying, "I will cooperate if there is anything I can do so that we can return to our daily lives as soon as possible."
One year after the <Eastern Iburi Earthquake> securing water even in the event of a power outage Proceed with the installation of "sprinkler taps" directly connected to water pipes Hakodate's condominium: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
In response to the blackout caused by the Eastern Iburi Earthquake in September last year, countermeasures are underway at condominiums in Hakodate City, where the water outage occurred.
According to the Water Supply and Sewerage Department of the Municipal Enterprise Bureau, in the year after the earthquake, seven condominium buildings installed "sprinkler taps" that can dispense water even if the power goes out.
There are about 400 condominiums and private apartment buildings with four floors or more in the city that supply water through a "water tank" system, which may cut off water in the event of a power outage, and the ministry is calling for consideration of countermeasures.
There are two main types of water supply methods for houses: the "receiving tank type" in which water is stored in a receiving tank located underground or on the rooftop, and the "direct connection type" in which water is supplied directly to each house from the city's water distribution pipes.
In the receiving tank type, even if the water pipe is not damaged, if the electric pump that pumps water from the receiving tank to each house stops working due to a power outage, etc., water cannot be supplied and each house will be cut off.

Greeting on the stage on the first day of "Nintendo Academy"
This work is a poignant story in which the leader of the Akimoto-gumi, a yakuza who has an eye for social contribution, undertakes to rebuild a high school that is on the verge of bankruptcy and solves a number of difficult problems with his in-laws.
Nishida plays the tough-faced but somewhat hateful group leader, and Nishijima plays Himura, the number two of the Akimoto-gumi who is always swayed by his boss.
Nishijima was overwhelmed with emotion on the first day, saying, "I've been nervous all the way up until today."
"Not only during the filming period, but also after the filming was over, the members of this team often got together and talked about various things, so it was a very cohesive team," he says.
Ito also laughed and said, "There was a reflection meeting, which was just a drinking party where there was no reflection at all," and said, "It was a plus for the site to be able to make such a time, and teamwork improved and motivation increased. Even after it was over, it continued on a regular basis, and I have a lot of good memories," he said, revealing that he spent precious time with him.
In the story of the drinking party, Nishijima's surprising true face was also revealed.
Nishijima confessed, "When I was having a reflection meeting with this member, I drank too much, and I often don't remember about half of it."
Nishida said, "The other party doesn't know how he's getting sick," and he was impressed, saying, "You look like a shiraf, but were you drunk?
It was a work that fostered good teamwork, and Nishida expressed his enthusiasm, saying, "If it is well received, it may be made into a series, and I would like to do my best to make it into a series with everyone's help," Ito said, "We are also full of enthusiasm to make it into a series," and Nakao said, "I was disappointed because Nishida was singing after watching the movie. If it is made into a series, I want to sing it this time," and director Kimura also said, "In my mind, a sequel has already been decided," and received a big round of applause.
Prefectural Fishermen's Federation "Start Discussions for Full-Scale Operation" Chairman Nozaki Refrains from Remarks on Ocean Discharge " Iwaki Minpo Official Website
In the wake of the accident at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, it was decided to discuss the ongoing trial operation of the fishery off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture in each district for full-scale operation.
On the 27th, a meeting of the heads of the prefectural fishermen's federation (Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives) was held at the prefectural fisheries hall in Chuodai Iino, and while the heads of the prefectural fishermen's cooperatives in the prefecture were in attendance, Chairman Satoshi Nozaki said, "As a prefectural fishermen's federation, I think it is necessary to move toward full-scale operation.
The union presidents' meeting also approved the official addition of scorpionfish, cherry trout, and purple trout off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where the shipping restriction order has been lifted, to the list of fish species subject to the trial operation.
The remaining non-target seafood were two fish species: binos mussels and common mussels.
After the event, Chairman Nozaki spoke to the media and emphasized that the start date of full-scale operations has not yet been decided.
Regarding the treated water after the purification of the contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, he said, "The argument that has a keren-flavored flavor is a problem, and our position against the discharge into the ocean has not changed," and criticized the remarks of former environment minister Yoshiaki Harada and Osaka mayor Ichiro Matsui.
In discussing the full-scale operation, Akira Egawa, president of the Iwaki City Fisheries Cooperative, pointed out that "it is necessary to absorb opinions from below" and said that the intentions of the members would be respected.
The umbrella branches will hold a board meeting to solve each of the problems they face, and then come to a conclusion as a municipal fishery cooperative.
Kanji Tachitani, president of the Soma Futaba Fisheries Cooperative, says, "In addition to fishermen, we need to discuss with middlemen."
With the support of the government, the Soma Futaba Fisheries Cooperative said that "it is important to return the catch first" because seven new vessels will be installed next year, and that they intend to improve the environment in parallel with discussions on full-scale operations.
Street activities to improve driving and smoking manners Karatsu Tobacco Sales Cooperative|Town Topics|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LiVE
Union members calling on drivers to drive safely = Waseda Saga Junior and Senior High School in Tojo, Karatsu City
In conjunction with the "Autumn Traffic Safety Prefectural Citizens' Campaign", the Karatsu Tobacco Sales Cooperative held a street activity on the city road in front of Waseda Saga Junior and Senior High School in Tojo, Karatsu City on the 26th.
About 10 people, including union members, participated in the event, calling on drivers to drive safely.

"Beauty and ugliness" are one and the same?
What is the image of "snake" that overlaps the beautiful girls of Kazuo Yuzu's work (Magmix) --Yahoo! News
What do mysterious beauty and shadowy expressions have in common?
In August 2019, the "Kazuo Kazuo Bishoujo Collection" (Genkosha) was released, focusing on beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Yuzu, who has released numerous works to the world since the 1950s and is known as a leading expert in "horror manga".
When I pick it up and look at it, I am reminded of the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" in Kazuo Yuzu's work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a "shadow"?
Beautiful girls of Kazuo Yuzu's work (5 photos)
In the prologue of the "Bishoujo Collection", there is a sentence that says, "The beauty of these women, which is the opposite of the horror, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story, stands out", but the beautiful face is distorted and changed to an expression of resentment with a grudge ... ... It may be because of this contrast that "fear" stands out more.
The keyword "snake" is often used in Kazuo Yuzu's works, and snakes are perceived in various ways, from being perceived as "creepy creatures" by some people to being "beautiful" depending on the viewer.
There are people in the world who like reptiles, and there are people who just don't like it.
In this way, depending on the sensibility of the viewer, a creature in which "beauty" and "ugliness" are inextricably linked may be a "snake".
In addition, this creature has been revered as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" settled is auspicious.
Two of his works based on the snake are "Snake Girl" and "Mottled Girl" from the 1965 "I'm Afraid of Mommy!" series.
It is generally the market that the "snake woman" is a beautiful woman with a shadow.
To put it in a crazy way, I would say that I am a "cool buty" type ... ... I feel that this is the common point of the beautiful girls who appear in Yuzu's works.
Among them, "Orochi", the main character of "Orochi", which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be a representative of Yuzu's works, but the part that goes into a deep sleep every hundred years in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, and the part that has mysterious powers, is somewhat reminiscent of "snake".
Seven international students from Xavier High School pay a courtesy call on the mayor of Sanyo Onoda|Ube Nippo Konomachi Media Web
On the 26th, seven students studying at Xavier High School (Principal Hideki Matsubara) paid a courtesy visit to Goji Fujita, the mayor of Sanyo Onoda City.
The international students talked about what they wanted to do during their stay, and Mayor Fujita encouraged them to have a meaningful school life.
Taking advantage of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's subsidized project "Asia Bridge Project", high school students (15~17 years old) from various countries came to Japan last month.
Six girls from China, Cambodia, Mongolia, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia live in the school's dormitory for eight months.
Boys in Turkey spend 10 months in school while staying with a homestay.
One by one, the international students who visited the city hall introduced themselves in Japanese.
Regarding his impression of the city, he said, "When I take a walk, people I don't know greet me, and it's a quiet and pleasant city."
He also said, "I want to see Mt. Fuji while I'm in Japan."
In addition, the girls living in the dormitory also had the opportunity to interact with their host families and were looking forward to participating in the library festival as volunteers.
Mayor Fujita urged students to "actively gain a variety of experiences and experiences, and invite your friends and host families to participate in the city's Halloween event to be held at Oda Sun Park next month."
State Minister Yamamoto deletes meal tweet on the eve of explanation of the cause of the helicopter crash|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
A Twitter screen where State Minister of Defense Tomohiro Yamamoto posted a comment with a photo of Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Defense Kazuchika Iwata and deleted it
By the 27th, Vice Minister of Defense Tomohiro Yamamoto deleted a Twitter comment that he wrote "It's delicious ~" when he ate at a yakitori restaurant in Saga Prefecture.
Yamamoto had arrived in the prefecture on February 26 to explain to the local government the results of the investigation into the crash of a Ground Self-Defense Force AH64D combat helicopter in February last year.
On the evening of the same day, he tweeted, "I came to Saga Prefecture on a business trip!"
Along with a photo of Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Defense Kazuchika Iwata, who was elected from the same prefecture at the meal, he posted a comment such as "It's delicious ~".
In the accident, a girl who was in the house was injured and two members of the team were killed.
Mr. Yamamoto was elected to the House of Representatives four times and was elected to the proportional southern Kanto region.
The circle of "children's cafeterias" that provide free or inexpensive meals to children is spreading throughout the country.
According to a survey by NPOs and other organizations, about 3,700 locations are active nationwide this year.
The number has increased by 1.6 times compared to 2018, and there are 24 locations in Fukui Prefecture, an increase of 9 from last year.
Why is it a children's cafeteria now?
▼ Makoto Yuasa, president of the NPO and a social activist, spoke about the background and significance of the event at a lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area has become lonely, and the shopping district has declined.
There is no place for people to meet.
Therefore, "there was a need for a regional exchange base where people could interact with each other."
▼ Even though it is a children's cafeteria, it is a "place for multi-generational exchange" in which the elderly also participate.
Not only will it eliminate solitary eating, but it will also support child-rearing and improve the health of the elderly.
Break the cycle of poverty and revitalize the community.
The important thing is not to create children who are repelled by it.
▼ There are various places that serve meals from once a month to every day.
They range in size from a few to hundreds of people, and the venues range from private homes to temples.
An atmosphere is being created where people who want to do it can do it.
Such a low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure operating expenses and staff.
We sometimes hear about issues such as safe management systems
▼ However, "Values change by interacting with many people" "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in the event of a disaster," says Yuasa.
It seems to be a beacon of hope in a closed society.
The final day of the Fukui Prefectural High School Baseball Tournament will be held on 29 September at the Prefectural Baseball Stadium (Fukui City) with the final and third-place playoffs.
In the final, Tsuruga Kihi, who is aiming to win the title for the first time in four years, and Tsuruga, who is aiming to win the title for the first time in 36 years, will compete in the autumn tournament.
Seeded school Tsuruga Kihi won three consecutive games from the first round.
In the semi-final against Hokuriku, ace Naoki Kasashima pitched a complete game to earn a complete-game victory.
The offense has been strong with 13 hits, and we hope to support the pitching staff in the final.
Tsuruga, on the other hand, came out of the unseeded tournament.
In the quarterfinals, they won a close match by one goal, and in the semifinals against Hamizu, they scored the first goal with a squeeze and escaped with a 3-1 victory.
We want to make sure that we convert our chances into goals in the final.
The third-place match for the one remaining spot in the Hokushinetsu tournament will be between Hokuriku and Hamizu.
Hokuriku had a rough run and bunt early in the semifinals, but they want to make up for it in the third-place game.
On the other hand, Hamizu attracted the attention of this tournament by defeating the powerhouse Fukui Institute of Technology.
It will be interesting to see if they can win the third-place play-off.

"True culprit" who attacked Saudi Arabian oil facilities with a drone ( FRIDAY ) --Yahoo! News
"In recent years, the performance of the Iranian-made drone 'Ababir' used in this bombing has improved dramatically by analyzing the crashed U.S. military drone.
It can be manufactured inexpensively and has a cruising range of about 1000 km.
Another advantage is that it flies at low altitudes, so it is difficult to be detected by radar."
On September 14, the oil facilities of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, were bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly after this, the Houthi rebel group in Yemen claimed responsibility.
"It is safe to assume that Iran, led by President Rouhani, is behind the Houthis, which cannot allow its rival Saudi Arabia to make money from oil when it cannot export its own oil. The aim is to let the international community know that if the oil embargo against Iran continues, it will be accompanied by corresponding pain."
As much as half of Saudi Arabia's oil production was halted in the wake of the bombing, and oil prices soared by 15 percent.
Some say that if this trend continues, the oil shock will come again.
"Since Trump has pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East, he wants to avoid military intervention at all costs, at least until next year's election. However, the United States cannot stand out indefinitely. It is quite possible that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future."
The "proxy war" between the United States and Iran is on the verge of an imminent crisis.
The reason why a super unique YouTuber was able to become a full-time employee.
Ask the president who hired you (bizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47Delivery
A YouTuber who is now immensely popular, especially among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use them to advertise their products, but there are companies that have started an unusual system called "YouTuber hiring" that hires them as full-time employees.
It is Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as DmMiX), whose main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What exactly does it mean to "hire a YouTuber"?
We interviewed Yuki Kobayashi, the CEO of DmMiX and the representative of Staff First, a subsidiary where YouTubers were actually hired this time.
I want to support young people who are working hard to recruit YouTubers.
― ― How does "YouTuber recruitment" work in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): Nowadays, the profession of a YouTuber has become the dream of many young people.
It is also one of the top occupations that elementary school students want to work in the future, and the number of young people aiming for it will continue to increase in the future.
In the past, we have hired and supported young people who are chasing their dreams of being a bandsman or comedian.
In the same way, "YouTuber recruitment" is an attempt to recruit and support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming a YouTuber.
― ― There is an image that YouTubers are individuals who voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to "hire" them?
Kobayashi: While many young people aspire to be YouTubers, the reality is that most YouTubers don't make as much money as they would like.
There are many creators who work part-time while producing and posting videos, and there are many creators who do not have their families approve of their existence as YouTubers.
In this initiative, we will provide the creators we hire with a salary and an environment for content creation.
We are thinking of supporting the activities by supporting the disadvantages of the profession of YouTuber, which inevitably puts you in an unstable position at first.
Environmental Girl "Fighting for a Safe Future" Protests Around the World, 2nd Week in a Row|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
Greta Thunberg (center) and others participate in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada on the 27th (Reuters = Kyodo)
NEW YORK (Kyodo) -- Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who is calling for action against global warming, took part in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada, on Wednesday, stressing that she would "continue to fight for a safe future."
Youth protests on this day took place in Asian countries, Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.
The large-scale protests in response to Greta's call were held for the second week in a row following the 20th.
Greta met with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau on the 27th.
Mr. Trudeau, who usually appeals to his enthusiastic stance on global warming countermeasures, also participated in the demonstration march.
But Greta was dry about Trudeau after the meeting, saying she was "clearly not doing enough."
"I hope that South Korea will return to GSOMIA" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of the United States (Sankei Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
In an exclusive interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo on November 27, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Japan (Korea and Japan) said he hoped South Korea would reconsider its decision to scrap the Comprehensive Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) between Japan and South Korea, which expires on November 23.
It is unusual for a U.S. official to mention reconsidering the scrapping of GSOMIA.
The GSOMIA has been signed by Japan and South Korea, Japan and the United States, and the United States and South Korea, respectively, and serves as a platform for sharing information on missile launches.
South Korea announced in August that it would cancel the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military intelligence in Japan and South Korea will collapse.
Mr. Napper argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot respond effectively to the crisis."
"There is still time until the expiration of the contract," he said, urging South Korea to return.
He also acknowledged the threat of joint flight drills conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July, saying it was "the first time in history" and stressed that "it is essential that the United States, South Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, work together in an alliance."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration of Japan-South Korea relations "hurts the national interests of the United States."
"We have no intention of mediating," he said, but "we will play a positive role so that Japan and South Korea can bridge the gap."

Tokaimura criticality accident, 20 years in 30 days 300 nuclear facility troubles: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
From fiscal 2000 to FY18, the year after the criticality accident in Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture, where the first person in Japan's history of nuclear power died due to radiation exposure, there were 336 reports of accidents and malfunctions at nuclear-related facilities nationwide, according to an interview with the Nuclear Regulation Authority on May 28.
In 30 days, it will be 20 years since the criticality accident that sounded the alarm on the safety myths of the nuclear industry.
Although about 90% of the incidents were not evaluated because the International Rating Scale (INES), which indicates the severity of the accident, was Level 0 (not important for safety), it is necessary to constantly raise safety awareness based on the lessons learned from the accident and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011.
Koichi Soda, who has completed the story and original illustrations of a creative picture book and is soliciting donations for publication = September 18, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
Koichi Soda, a 64-year-old artist and member of the Echizen City Community Revitalization Cooperation Team in Fukui Prefecture, has started a crowdfunding campaign to solicit donations online with the aim of publishing a creative picture book inspired by the legends of the prefecture in order to promote community development that makes use of picture books.
Ms. Soda, who is from Hokkaido and started her activities as a volunteer in April this year, is eager to "convey the compassion of the people of Fukui, based on their deep faith, through picture books."
【Click here to donate】To convey the heart of Fukui.
While Mr. Soda is active as an artist working on contemporary art with mathematical motifs, he has also been active as a member of the Volunteers since his retirement.
After being involved in the urban development of Nagano, Kumamoto, and Tochigi, he arrived in Echizen City in April this year.
In reference to the city that produced Satoko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, we aim to create a town that makes use of picture books.
After living in the city, Mr. Soda says, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion around me that I understood for the first time."
What caught my attention was the legend of Awara City, "The Demon Mask of the Bride".
The story is about Shutome, who can no longer remove the demon mask, and the kind-hearted daughter-in-law continues to chant Nembutsu to help Shutome without worrying about being surprised by the mask.
"Forgetting hatred, I returned with compassion and kindness, and I felt the origin of the piety and kindness of the people of Fukui."
Inspired by the original picture book, Mr. Soda conducted a series of interviews, including going to Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City as soon as he arrived, and completed the story "Meo and the Demon," which features a kind-hearted demon couple and a boy.
Since June, she has been drawing 10 scenes in warm watercolors to make use of her day job, and the materials for the picture book have been prepared.
In addition, using Echizen washi, a traditional craft that lives in Echizen City, the cover of the picture book will be produced in Japanese paper.
This will lead to opportunities for parents and children to enjoy the touch of Japanese paper through storytelling.
The goal for the publication of 600 copies is 850,000 yen.
The deadline is October 25th.
Mr. Soda said, "The spirit of Fukui, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, can be proud of throughout the country.
Through picture books, I want to convey the true kindness and compassion that have been passed down from generation to generation to children."
This is one of the projects that Fukui Prefecture has certified 11 regional revitalization projects that are being challenged by the prefecture's cooperation volunteers and businesses, and supports them by utilizing hometown tax payments.
The Fukui Shimbun disseminates information, and the Bank of Fukui cooperates with the Bank of Fukui in providing management support.
You can donate from the crowdfunding site "Ready Four".

Ahead of the consumption tax hike, last-minute customers one after another Retail stores in Okayama Prefecture, special price sale: Sanyo Shimbun Digital |
The sales floor of the Bic Camera Okayama Station store, where sales of large home appliances are strong before the tax hike
On the 28th, the last weekend before the consumption tax hike from 8% to 10%, families who rushed to buy at home appliance retailers and supermarkets in Okayama Prefecture visited one after another.
There are home improvement stores that have special sales floors aimed at bulk purchases, and suit stores that sell winter clothing ahead of schedule, and each store is focusing on sales.
At the Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store (Ekimae-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama City), we are holding a sale with a special price for a limited time until the 30th.
A 37-year-old office worker in the city who came to the store in search of a refrigerator said, "Even though it is only 2%, the difference cannot be overlooked when it comes to expensive items."
According to the store, sales of large appliances such as TVs, washing machines, and refrigerators increased in September, and sales were about double that of the previous year.
"The last-minute demand is more than we imagined, and in the second half of the year, customers looking for high-priced items are conspicuous," said the person in charge.
The sale titled "Settlement of accounts just before the tax increase" will be carried out by Haruyama Shoji (Doomote Town), which sells suits.
The company has been selling coats since early September, one month earlier than usual, and this month's sales are up 10% compared to the previous year.
An office worker man (19) who visited the Kurashiki store (Shirakucho, Kurashiki City) to buy a suit to wear for the coming-of-age ceremony = Asaguchi City = said, "The ceremony is still ahead, but I want to buy it before the tax increase."
In this tax increase, the tax rate on food and beverages will remain unchanged under the reduced tax rate system, so home centers and supermarkets will focus on daily necessities and alcohol.
At the Time Takaya store (Kaneki, Naka-ku, Okayama City), a home improvement store, there is a special corner loaded with large-capacity detergents and tissues near the entrance.
Sales of daily consumables increased 1.6 times compared to the same month last year, and "if you don't replenish them many times a day, you will run out" (Seiya Shimizu, store manager).
A 63-year-old civil servant from the same city who visited the store bought kitchen paper in bulk, saying, "I'm going to buy it anyway, so I'll take this opportunity."
The Tenmanya Happy Town Okaminami store (Chikko Shinmachi, Minami-ku, the same city) will also set up wagons loaded with detergent, toilet paper, disposable diapers, etc. at the event hall.
A 35-year-old office worker in the city said, "If you receive a point reward for cashless payment, the burden will hardly change, so you don't have to rush to buy daily necessities."
2019 Best Coach Klopp 'The Most Outstanding Director' in Honoring the Greatest Enemy General ( SPORT.es ) --Yahoo! News
Jurgen Klopp, who won the Best Director award for The Best, reflected on his career in an interview and also commented on the current situation.
Among the many remarks, one that surprised the world was about Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who will be his biggest rival in the race for the Premier League title.
Neymar's best friend Alves says: "His happiness is still at Barça ... 」
Speaking after the award ceremony for The Best, the German coach said: "I never imagined anything so great, I am very happy and proud to have received this award. It's been a great few days for me. Thanks to my players, I was able to win the award. The most important thing is the team."
Regarding Guardiola, Klopp said, "I have a lot of respect for him," adding: "What can I say about him? The style of play for his team is extraordinary. He's the best coach I've ever played against and it's an honour to be nominated and compete with him for the award."
He also mentions manager Pochettino and Tottenham.
"His last year was unbelievable, and a lot of times you have to win a title to be remembered by people. Little by little, we built up the team and played in a great style".
Klopp was unsure about his best moment of 2019: "The comeback against Barcelona. I don't think a lot of experts and myself would have bet a single centimeter on us. Against a team with Messi and Suarez, 3-0 behind . . . It's like a death sentence. We had a small chance and we were able to take it. I couldn't believe it. Looking back, I could say that we won the CL in this match. This match will be remembered by everyone."
Asked about a more personal question at the end, Klopp said: "When I was celebrating winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was. That didn't happen this time. I don't like to get drunk because I'm a self-disciplined person. The celebration of winning the CL was very modest. I remember them all. If I were to line up everyone in front of me, I might be able to recognize all the people I saw from the bus."

I want to use Sidecar~
According to Apple, macOS Catalina, a new OS that will be delivered in October.
The specific date has not been revealed, but it may be released on October 4th.
The release date of macOS Catalina may be October 4th.
The image above was originally posted on Apple's site in Denmark (now fixed).
The image does indeed read, "From October 4 (fra den 4. oktober )
If it is an official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, the feature I personally want to try the most in macOS Catalina is "Sidecar".
This is a function that treats the iPad as a sub-display of the Mac, and is a function that was previously realized by third-party applications.
And since Sidecar is a genuine function of Apple, it is expected to be more complete (and responsive).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first you want to experience this next-gen macOS to the fullest.
Sakura shrimp in the process of growing PT in Shizuoka City, etc., photographed at a depth of 290 meters|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
Sakura shrimp born this year that was successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay = 11th, off the coast of Kambara, Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City (Courtesy of "Yui Sakura Shrimp Project")
The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, a group of industry, academia, and government from Shizuoka City and other industries, academia, and government, recently succeeded in photographing cherry shrimp that are believed to have been born during the spawning season in Suruga Bay at a depth of 290 meters.
The video of the growth process is valuable, and the people involved hope that it will lead to the elucidation of the ecology of the cherry shrimp, which has many mysteries.
The photo was taken near the seabed about 1.5 kilometers off the coast of the Kambara district of Shimizu Ward, the same city.
A total of about 300 animals were confirmed in 17 minutes.
The conventional knowledge that cherry shrimp, which live in the deep sea during the day, "form a certain amount of school on the seabed" has been confirmed.
The adult is about 40 mm long, and the individual in the picture is about 23 mm long.
The seasonal data of the caught cherry shrimp were compared to identify the spawning season.
Detailed analysis will be provided by Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Industrial Technology College, which make up the team.
Project leader Keisuke Mizuno says, "We want to capture the living appearance of individuals in the process of growing, including juvenile shrimp."
Resumption of Mother Ranch, free for Chiba residents Until the end of October, damaged by typhoon|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
At the mother ranch that has resumed business, Chiba Prefecture's mascot character "Chiba-kun" welcomes visitors = 28 morning, Futtsu City, Chiba Prefecture
Mother Ranch in Futtsu City, Chiba Prefecture, which had been closed since the 9th due to power outages and facility damage caused by Typhoon No. 15, resumed business on the 28th.
In an effort to liven up the disaster-stricken area, residents of Chiba Prefecture will be admitted free of charge until the end of October.
Many people visited the park as soon as it opened under the autumn sun, and at the entrance gate, the prefectural mascot character "Cheeba-kun" who rushed to cheer them on welcomed them.
Some facilities have roofs covered with blue tarps and are still undergoing repairs, but half of the restaurants have reopened.
Kenji Mitani, a 34-year-old office worker from Sagamihara City, who visited with his family, said with a smile, "I was worried about when it would reopen, and I came here to enjoy the potato digging event in the hope that it would lead to reconstruction."

【Bud Olympics Race First Half】World Champion Kento Momota and in-form Zhou Tiancheng are one step ahead!
< Men's Singles > (Bud× Spy!
The Japan National Team, who won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, a major badminton event held in August, will compete in the China Open (Changzhou/Super1000), which starts on 17 September, after completing their training camp in early September.
Here, we look back on the first half of the tournament from May to August, when the Olympic race for next year's Tokyo Olympics began, and look ahead to the mid-round round (September ~ December) in the men's singles (text/Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
The badminton Olympic race, which began in May, has completed four high-level tournaments (Super 500 and above) in which the top players participate at the end of the World Championships.
The two players who maintained their good form in the first half of the season were Kento Momota, who won two of the four tournaments, and Taiwan's Zhou Tiancheng.
Momota won the World Championships, and Zhou Tiancheng won the Indonesia OP (S1000), a tournament where high points can be earned for "world ranking points" that are directly linked to the Olympic race.
Momota also won the Japan OP (S750).
Since May, we have participated in four tournaments: the Sudirman Cup (May, China), the Indonesian Open (July, the top 16), the Japan Open (July), and the World Championships (August).
Although the number is small compared to other top players, the schedule is less burdensome to the body.
Since there was only one World Championship in August, the fatigue will not be as great as during the back-to-back matches.
They will need a good result in the midfield battle, where the top competitions will be held in September and beyond.
Taiwan's ace is strong in consecutive battles.
Pay attention to young Thai people!
Zhou Tiancheng, who also won the Indonesian OP and Thailand OP (S500) top tournaments, has already competed in seven tournaments.
He also competed in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September and won the championship.
He is a physically strong player who does not mind consecutive matches.
Even if the tournament continues, there will be no major problems with the performance of the matches.
In fact, the high points scored in the first half of the season will have made it easier for them to adjust their schedules for future competitions.
Until last year, Zhou Tiancheng seemed to lack explosive power, but this year, he has become more consistent in terms of play, and he has been able to continue his good performance.
For world No. 1 Momota, it will be an even more difficult opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, the other players who achieved results in the first half of the match were Thailand's young ace Kantaphone and India's Sai Praneese B. 。
Then there are Anders Antonsen, who is struggling alone as a European team.
Although Cantaphone has not reached the finals of the top competitions, he has been able to advance to the top of the rankings, finishing in the top four in two tournaments this season.
There are still some rough edges, but the 20-year-old (21 on the 18th), who is now able to rally on an equal footing with the top athletes, seems to have a lot of potential to make a leap forward in the Olympic race.
Sai Praneis B. has also taken a step forward in India, which has a strong singles lineup.
Samir Barama, Pranoy H.S. . Srikanth Kidambi, who has been lagging behind due to injury, will also be playing catch-up in the future, so we need to be careful with the Indian side from the midfield onwards.
New mobile phone charges: Fair competition to reduce prices: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
With the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October, the new rate plans of mobile phone companies have been released.
However, it remained generally high.
Despite Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga's statement last summer that "there is room for price reductions of about 40 percent" and expectations for price cuts were rising, there was no price competition.
The main reason for this is that Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market has been postponed, and the oligopoly of the three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee structure that is easy to use through fair competition.
I would like to call for the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The amended law prohibits bundle discounts on handset charges and communication charges.
This is because instead of selling the terminal fee at a discount, the communication fee was set to be higher.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to cut handsets in half price.
However, both companies have a "SIM lock" that prevents them from using other companies' lines for 100 days.
NTT DoCoMo will reduce the cost of handsets by up to one-third only for subscribers of its own lines.
All three companies seem to be continuing to "lock in" to prevent them from switching to other companies.
Regarding SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has indicated a policy that requires immediate release.
Companies also need to respond urgently.
Rakuten's postponement was due to the fact that the development of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It was expected to be a catalyst for a price reduction competition, so it was a shrug.
I think there was a lack of foresight.
The timing of the start of the full-scale service and the price have not been disclosed.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to take responsibility for your business.
The price revision was triggered by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga's remarks.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the new rates of the three companies, saying, "I think competition will start from now on, and I don't think it will be good at all."
However, I do not think that "government-made price cuts" will distort the market and promote healthy competition.
Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before the government interferes with them.
The fee structure of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency has called attention to the fact that there are cases where the burden on consumers exceeds half the price even though the terminal advertises that it will be up to half the price.
Companies themselves must try to provide polite and easy-to-understand explanations so as not to cause misunderstandings among users.
Withdrawal limit lowered to 500,000 yen Cash card of 3 shinkin in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun
Three credit unions in Mie Prefecture (Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank, Kitaise Ueno Shinkin Bank, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank) announced on the 26th that they have decided to lower the withdrawal limit by cash card in order to prevent damage from special fraud.
The maximum amount that can be withdrawn per day with a cash card is 500,000 yen for depositors aged 70 and over who hold cash cards of Kuwana Mie, Kita-Ise-Ueno, and Kihoku Shinkin unions and who have not made a withdrawal transaction of more than a certain amount at an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) in the past three years.
Kuwana Mie Shinkin Bank and Kita-Ise-Ueno Shinkin Bank will implement a reduction rate from October 1, and Kihoku Shinkin Bank will implement a reduction rate from November 1.
In the prefecture, there have been many cases of special fraud in which people impersonate financial institutions and police officials to defraud cash cards and PINs and withdraw money at ATMs, and credit union officials say that they want to protect customers' important deposits in the best possible way.
Yokozuna Tsururyu et al. transferred to Mutsu room With the sudden death of Izutsu master|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
The Japan Sumo Association announced on the 27th that following the death of Izutsu Oyakata (former Sekiwaki Reverse Ho), it has approved the transfer of Yokozuna Tsururyu and three other wrestlers from the Izutsu room and one tokoyama to the Mutsu room.
The Mutsu room is the same as the Izutsu room.
His master, Mutsu Oyakata (former Ozeki Kirishima), was born in the Izutsu room and was the brother and son of the late Izutsu Oyakata.
Master Izutsu died suddenly on the 16th, and Tsururyu and the others were temporarily taken into custody of the same Kagamiyama room, and their future treatment was being discussed.
There are 12 wrestlers in the Mutsu room, including Juryo Kirimayama, who is from Mongolia like Tsururyu, as of the autumn season.
[Rugby World Cup] One shot ejection & brawl US player's "dangerous tackle in the face" overseas ripple "insulting and despicable play" ( THE ANSWER ) --Yahoo! News
US FL Quill plays rough, former England international: 'It's not something you can call a tackle'
The United States, the last of the 20 participating nations to make their last appearance at the Rugby World Cup (World Cup) in Japan on 26 June, lost to England 7-45.
It started off with a loss, but the rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half caused a stir.
He was sent off with a shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.
Overseas media have also released videos of the actual scene, and a former England national team player has complained that it is "insulting and despicable play" and "cannot be called a tackle".
[Video] "Insulting and despicable play" and overseas ripples!
One shot was sent off, and the players of both sides were mixed up in a commotion ... U.S. National Team's Quill Performs Actual Moment of 'Dangerous Tackle in the Face'
The fierce fighting spirit has crossed the line.
It was 29 minutes into the second half when it was 0-38.
Deep in enemy territory, England captain Farrell lost his balance slightly as he caught a teammate's pass.
It was Quill who went for the tackle.
However, I raised my upper body instead of my hips down, and hit my upper body violently.
As a result, the opponent's head makes contact with each other's heads, resulting in a headbutt.
Farrell was violently thrown and collapsed.
The England player vehemently protested against the obvious lack of legitimacy in an attempt to shove Quill.
The players from both sides gathered at once, and the atmosphere was instantaneous.
As a result of the TMO (video review), Quill was sent off with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad look on his face, but was booed by some from the crowd calling for fair play.
Rugby powerhouse New Zealand's local media "Staff" ran a feature with the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players sent off for despicable play, England win comfortably."
"Kill was sent off after a despicable shoulder charge to the face of England star Farrell" "It was almost a brawl between players from both sides," the report said.
The article features comments from former England player and commentator Hugo Monja.
"It's insulting, it's despicable, it's not a tackle. It's a despicable play."
The U.S., who were without one player in the match, managed to escape a shutout loss with a try in the 81st minute.
However, Quill's play left a bad aftertaste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals that were judged to have "poor medical records" out of 1,455 public hospitals nationwide and public hospitals such as the JRCS.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the treatment results of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted: Awara Hospital, a national hospital organization in Awara City, Mikuni Hospital in Sakai City, Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, and Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town.
⇒ 4 hospitals subject to restructuring: "Standards are wrong"
In order to curb the growing medical costs caused by the aging of the population, the government took an unusual step, saying that it was necessary to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions.
In October, we will request the target hospitals to consider the reorganization and integration in earnest, and we will have a conclusion by September next year.
Although it is not enforceable, it is expected to be opposed by local chiefs and residents due to fears that there will be no hospital near them.
The announcement was made at a meeting on the same day.
The target hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, and many hospitals had a relatively small number of beds.
By prefecture, Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%) had the highest percentages.
Hokkaido had the highest number of subjects with 54, and Okinawa was the only one with zero.
Based on data from fiscal 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) surveyed 1,455 public and public hospitals that can handle the "highly acute phase" for critically ill patients and the "acute phase" for general surgery.
We analyzed the results of nine medical treatments, such as cancer and emergency medicine, and whether competing hospitals were located within a 20-minute drive, and determined the necessity of publishing the names of hospitals.
Eligible hospitals will be asked to consider abolishing or moving some departments to other hospitals.
Medical costs will skyrocket in 25 years, when all baby boomers will be 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a target of reducing the number of beds in hospitals nationwide from 1,246,000 (18 years) to 1,191,000.
Currently, there are many beds in the "advanced acute phase" and "acute phase" where nurses are generously staffed and medical expenses are high, while there is a shortage of beds for rehabilitation, which is in high need for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a "Regional Medical Care Concept" that sets out the number of beds required in 25 years.
The country is divided into 339 zones, and local governments and medical officials are holding discussions, but many local residents and mayors remain cautious, making the discussions difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare hopes to revitalize the discussion by announcing the names of hospitals with poor track records.
Assuming the eruption of Mt. Komaga, comprehensive disaster prevention drills such as roads, wide area with the participation of residents, for the first time in 18 years (video) : Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
On September 27, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill simulating the eruption of Mt. Komagatake (1,131 meters) was held in the forests, Nanai, and Shikabe towns in the Toshima region.
About 400 people, including officials and residents of 20 organizations including the province and the three towns, participated.
This is the first time the event has been held since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan in August that included evacuation routes for residents.
This is the first time in 18 years that residents have participated in a wide-area drill.
It is assumed that Mt. Komaga erupted at 8:45 a.m., and the mudflow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), evacuation centers were opened in the towns of Mori and Nanai, and residents traveled by buses and provincial police vehicles prepared by each town.
100,000 students at Vancouver's climate demonstration appeal for measures against global warming during school holidays (Minna no Keizai Shimbun Network) --Yahoo! News
On September 27, about 100,000 citizens, mainly students, who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, marched in Vancouver to call for climate action.
Climate demonstration in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall, across the Camby Bridge, to the downtown library.
People with placards began to gather in front of the city hall a few hours before the start of the meeting, and by 13 o'clock, the start time, the number of people filled the road several blocks in front of the city hall.
Since then, the number of participants has continued to grow, and eventually more than 100,000 people participated.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated by restricting the road, and for several hours they watched until everyone had finished walking.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, a number of events have been held in Vancouver since last weekend to think about global warming.
On the 27th, the last day of the event, a school strike was held called "Fridays for Future."
On this day, the students who took a day off from school to participate appealed to the adults that they wanted to protect the earth even if they took a break from school, and many adults who took time off from work to participate also replied, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning and thinking."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) in 9 prefectures recommended for swine fever vaccine (Gifu Shimbun Web) --Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced on the 27th a draft revision of the epidemic prevention guidelines that will allow preventive vaccination of domestic pigs, which is not currently permitted, in order to prevent the spread of the livestock infectious disease "swine cholera".
The target area will be nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi prefectures, where infections in pigs and wild boar have been confirmed.
The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs will be restricted within the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the region will be permitted.
After public comment, the company aims to complete the procedure by the end of October at the earliest.
By using vaccines and allowing the export of meat and other products outside the region, the country will no longer be a "clean country" certified by international organizations, which may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak last September, Japan has been temporarily suspended as a clean country.
In the revised bill, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has established "recommended vaccination areas" for areas with a high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs, based on the opinions of experts.
The target prefecture will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the scope, timing, number of heads, and how to proceed with vaccination, and after receiving confirmation from the ministry, the governor will approve the use.
The other seven prefectures listed as recommended vaccination areas are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
The region will make a decision based on the situation when the guidelines are revised.
As a general rule, the movement of inoculated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses, excrement, etc. is restricted to the region.
Meat and processed products will not be covered in consideration of the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and distribution outside the region will be allowed in effect.
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, thoroughly dispose of food waste.
We will appeal for the safety of vaccinated pigs and work to prevent reputational damage.
The draft revision of the guidelines was compiled at an expert meeting held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinion inquiries and public comments to prefectural governments until October 7, and the new epidemic prevention guidelines will be enforced.
Independent Keisuke Honda makes public approach to Man Utd!
"Give me an offer, I don't need money" ( Football Channel ) --Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57Delivery
Former Japan midfielder Keisuke Honda, who left Australian A-League side Melbourne Victory last season and is now unaffiliated, has made a surprising move.
【Video】Keisuke Honda, was he actually in the game?
The astonishing truth is revealed
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th Japan time, made an open approach to one club, saying, "Give me an offer, I don't need money, but I need to play with a great team and great teammates."
The person to whom I sent the "counter-offer" was Manchester United, a world-famous club.
Why did Honda make such a grand request to one of the best clubs in the Premier League?
The trigger was an article in the Australian edition of "FOX Sports" published on the 24th.
In an article titled "5 forwards Manchester United could grab amid injury crisis", we picked out five unaffiliated players who are currently available.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Arfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bonney were Honda's name.
United are currently in a state of emergency with a number of injuries to midfielder Paul Pogba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, forward Anthony Martial and forward Marcus Rashford.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Red Devils have had a difficult start to the season with two wins and 22 defeats in the league and have struggled with the quality of their forward line.
Therefore, the Australian media named Honda as a candidate for a new force to gain leverage.
According to the article, "Honda's signing as a creative side player, not a striker, strictly speaking, can fill the void filled by Andreas Pereira."
His nine goals in 18 appearances for Melbourne Victory is a "solid record", but it has also been pointed out that "the 33-year-old needs to get away from his entertainment of managing the Cambodian national team and get full attention".
Will Honda's approach bear fruit?
It will be interesting to see if United make a move for the veteran, who has publicly stated that his goal is to qualify for next year's Tokyo Olympics.

The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on March 26 that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 portable translators at stores in Hamamatsu City as part of a project to lend the portable translator "POCKETALK" free of charge to member offices.
It is said to be the first time in Japan that the translator has been centrally deployed in the same area, and it will be interesting to see if it will lead to an improvement in the ability to respond to inbound (tourists visiting Japan).
The breakdown of the loan recipients is 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 other facilities.
The city's central ward accounts for 60% of the total.
The company has also started to display the loan address on the map app "Google Maps" so that the location of "stores that support foreign languages" can be found on smartphones.
It can be accessed from the website of the Lake Hamana tourist area.
The free loan of POCKETALK in 74 languages was launched in April in response to the declaration of "Hamamatsu as Japan's No. 1 inbound support city" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lease them to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as hospitality certification and the introduction of cashless payment for a period of two years.
The person in charge of the chamber said, "We hope that this will lead to the development of new foreign customers in the difficult business environment."
Now Naodora master Hiroyo Ikemura doesn't need to tee up even on the first shot?
Today's Caddy's Best Shot
The 1W shot is not necessarily hit off the tee.
There is also a technique called "Naodora" that hits the ball on the ground when you want to gain distance on the second shot of a par 5.
In recent 1Ws, there is a risk that the ball will scatter due to the large head volume, but there are players who frequently practice this on the tee ground.
Hiroyo Ikemura is waiting for his first win on the tour.
The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a professional, is small at 166 cm tall, but is currently ranked seventh in the driving distance category (average 304.02 yd).
While he excelled at long shots, one of his issues was the accuracy of his fairway woods.
In early spring, he opened his eyes by saying, "I couldn't shoot the spoon (3W), so I thought I'd try a straight drum shot."
From a practice round, he sometimes drops the ball on the grass of the teeria and swings the 1W without thinking.
In cases where big carries are required, tee-ups are used extensively, but they make effective use of straight ups on holes where both sides are narrow.
"You can use it in halls where your eyes are down."
In ballistic measuring instruments, 270yd~280yd was recorded in carry.
"That's why I don't need a 3W, and my caddy feels safer with a straight car than a 3W ... 」 。
Since the Japan Tour Championship in June, there has been only one wood in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is UT with a loft of 17 degrees.
His tactics are surprising even to his tour mates, and the exclamations that leak from the gallery that he sees are also delightful.
The trick is to swing the club to a level (horizontal).
"Whether it's a down blow or an uppercut, it doesn't fly straight, it goes to the right if it's a cut trajectory. Originally, I was doing a straight-up to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the tee-up). With this practice, the attack angle (the angle of incidence of the club) will also be relaxed."
The ball is not caught, and there is a risk of a slice, but "so the left side can be erased (not turned left)."
It's easy to say, but... It's a professional skill that makes you growl involuntarily.

Shiri: "This time, I want to fulfill my love ... Yuko Araki & Kengo Takara starring Fuji Rendora "Motokare Mania" appearance decision (Sports Hochi) --Yahoo! News
Actress Shiri (29) will appear in Fuji TV's new drama "Motokaremania" (starting October 17, Thursday at 10 o'clock) starring Yuko Araki (25) and Kengo Takara (31).
Shiri plays Chizuru Kaga, a colleague at a major food manufacturer where Akio Yamashita, played by Kenta Hamano (38), works.
Chizuru, an original character in the drama who does not appear in the original story, is not interested in marriage and sees marriage as a "means" to avoid financial problems herself.
That's when Yamashita appeared.
Witnessing the future and the beautiful way of eating rice that has prospered from the rare Hokkaido to the Tokyo headquarters, he approaches "just the right marriage partner".
Chizuru seems to have a strong mentality, but in fact, her mental strength is as weak as tofu.
In order to lay down a love strategy to avoid getting hurt, he gets very upset when things don't go as expected.
The film depicts how Chizuru, who lives a life of bravado, meets and interacts with Yurika and Yamashita, played by Yuko Araki, and changes as she interacts with them.
This will be the first time that Shiri, who has appeared in a number of high-profile works such as the NHK TV series "Toto Sister-chan" (April ~ October 2016) and the TBS series "Black Paean" (April 2018), will appear in a Fuji terrestrial TV drama.
"For some reason, I have a lot of roles where love doesn't come to fruition, so I hope that this time (love) will be fulfilled (laughs), and I want to enjoy playing Chizuru Kaga," and "I'm looking forward to seeing how I can create this world of 'Motokare Mania' with the cast and staff, who are full of individuality and charm. I hope it will be a drama that everyone will look forward to every Thursday at 10 o'clock," he said in a message to viewers.
In addition, it has been decided that Chizuru's junior new employee, Bo Hattori, will be played by 17-year-old Sorato Okura.
Okura, who is the youngest member of the regular cast, gives a fresh performance full of youth.
GQ MEN's 10 Days of Wearing-Day 9 "Skateboarding with Friends" ( GQ JAPAN ) --Yahoo! News
The only means of transportation is skateboarding!
I've been hooked ever since I started skating at the invitation of a friend.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to push through the asphalt.
Filson's hunting jacket is convenient because you can put your smartphone, wallet, or other luggage in it, and you can be hands-free.
With shorts, you can feel the wind directly and it feels good.
Not only on your feet, but also lightly with Converse skateboarding shoes.
The fashion and culture around skateboarding is also cool, so I check magazines and Instagram frequently!
I also started going to a salon run by a skater's hairdresser in Yutenji for haircuts.
I'm inspired by the tricks that I can't do yet, the information about skateboard parks, and various other things.
After school, our daily routine is to take a skateboard and walk around the city with our friends.

To release for the first time the autograph manuscript before Akutagawa's suicide Literary theory of weakness and tragedy|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
Ryunosuke Akutagawa's autograph manuscript to be exhibited for the first time at the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Hall
By the 27th, the Tabata Bunshi Village Memorial Museum in Kita-ku, Tokyo, had obtained the autograph manuscript of the essay "Continuation of Literature, Too Literary," published in the last years of his life when he fought with Junichiro Tanizaki about literary theory.
It will be exhibited at the museum from October 1st.
Although the existence of his essays was known to have been included in the complete collection, this is the first time that his manuscript has been made available to the public.
It is believed to have been written a few months before Akutagawa committed suicide, and Takeshi Tanei, a researcher at the memorial museum, says, "It shows that Akutagawa, who was weakened both physically and mentally, sincerely faced difficult literary issues with a tragic determination."
A total of 12 pages of 200-word manuscript paper were published in the April 27 issue of Bungei Shunju.
Greta Thunberg: "Why do adults mock and threaten children?" she questioned on Twitter.
Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg speaks at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on September 23.
While the speech has attracted attention, there have been messages that insult Greta.
Greta Thunberg "Why do adults mock and threaten children?"
A political commentator said on an American television program that Greta was "mentally ill and being used by her parents and the international left," and the TV station that used her apologized.
Even in Japan, there are many comments on the Internet about Greta that are not the content of Greta's remarks, such as "I feel sorry for being used" and "I should go to school."
Meanwhile, on September 26, Greta posted on her Twitter account, "Why do adults spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children?"
"They come up with every lie and conspiracy theory they can think of."
Greta said, "Look, it's started again, and as you can see, the people who hate me are as active as ever. They chase me around the way I look, the way I dress, the way I behave, and the things that make me different. They come up with every lie and conspiracy theory they can think of."
Noting that adults seem to be shifting the focus of the conversation because they don't want to confront the climate and environmental crises, he continued:
I honestly don't understand why adults spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children.
That time would be another good thing to do.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't waste your time paying attention to them any more.
The world is beginning to wake up.
Change is coming.
Whether the adults like the change or not.
See you on the street, Friday!
On the 20th, the previous Friday, strikes related to climate change were held in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta called for another on Friday the 27th.

Akita TV's 432nd Broadcast Program Council (Chairman Kiyohiko Ebata) was held to deliberate on the August 16 broadcast of "Really delicious Akita curry recommended by editors, cooking professionals, and celebrities."
The program introduced each of the best curry restaurants, points for enjoying the taste of professionals at home, and the secret story of the birth of the special retort curry.
While the committee members expressed opinions such as "It was simple and the concept and theme were clear," "I was interested in watching it until the end, and there was a tempo with curry bread and other items," and "I was able to see it from a different perspective than the gourmet site," there were also opinions such as "The reenactment drama is long" and "I wanted one-point advice on making curry professionally."

Garcia's Wedge Shot
I was able to improve to some extent in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I couldn't improve my putter because I couldn't improve it, so I was frustrated about that.
- Did you see an eagle on No. 6 and a birdie on No. 7 to win the championship?
After I made a bogey on No. 4, I still had a par-5 left, so I was trying to get it back, and then a chip-in eagle came to me on No. 6.
I was able to make a birdie on No. 7 and had a chance, but I was disappointed that I couldn't improve in the second half.
―What did you gain from this tournament?
I haven't been feeling good lately, so it was good to be able to keep the fairways on a narrow course.
The rough was also a course where the forward and reverse directions were different and the way to hit the ball and the distance changed, so I didn't have much experience, so I learned a lot.
―How is it different from regular tournaments?
It was possible to shoot with a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't mind it at all, but I was taking videos in the gallery.
Other than that, there wasn't much that changed, but since the tournament was co-hosted and there were not many Japan players, we went into the match with the mindset that we would not lose to overseas players.
The second half of the season will continue, but I need to win at least one game to win the prize money, so I want to win one more match, and there is also the ZOZO Championship just around the corner, so I will do my best to qualify for the tournament by finishing high in the tournament up to that point.
How to prevent dementia and keep it to the level of "forgetfulness"?
Interview and text: Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have tried to research and develop drugs for dementia and have been frustrated.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it seems that it has become clear that it may be possible to keep it to the extent of extremely mild illness and forgetfulness.
We interviewed Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Stroke Center, University Hospital.
Dementia doesn't go away
― ― There is a long-awaited anticipation of dementia prevention or treatment, but what is the current situation?
Otsuki: From mild to severe, everyone can develop dementia as they age.
However, it is believed that it will still take more than 20 years for a new dementia drug to be developed.
Donepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, is already not covered by insurance in some overseas countries, and a remarkable cure effect cannot be expected.
On the other hand, while deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are also decreasing due to remarkable advances in treatments such as anticancer drugs, people are now living longer.
Therefore, it is also true that the number of people with dementia is increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the person or his or her family alone, but it is necessary for society as a whole to create an environment where people can live in the community with peace of mind.
How to keep it to the level of "forgetfulness"
― ― Are there people who are more likely or less likely to develop dementia?
Otsuki Even if dementia is unavoidable, there is a possibility that the symptoms can be suppressed as much as possible and kept to the level of "forgetfulness".
Dementia is considered to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and people who are susceptible to dementia tend to have it.
First of all, people with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop dementia.
Dementia is regarded as a lifestyle-related disease.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterolemia.
The presence or absence of economic power also plays a role.
For example, in the United States, there are areas where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but the food you get with food tickets is non-perishable frozen hamburgers, pizza, and chicken.
It can be used by people who live in an environment where they cannot use gas or electricity and cannot cook in the first place.
As a result, you will end up with a diet low in vegetables and proteins, and your life will be biased toward fats and sugars.
Eventually, they become poor but obese, and the only thing they can do is watch TV in a daze, and they become physically disabled.
A similar situation could occur in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think or work tend to be more prone to dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books on a daily basis and think about things without metabolic syndrome.

Osamu Kigen, a valve of remorse for reproach Takanofuji's younger brother, deviating from guidance|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
On the 28th, the twin brother of Juryo Takanofuji, Takanoharu Makuuchi, who was urged by the Japan Sumo Association to voluntarily retire due to assault on a sumo wrestler, expressed his regret for being reprimanded for deviating from the scope of his coaching, saying, "I will take it seriously, and I will start from the minus, not from zero."
He was interviewed at the Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo, where he participated in the flower sumo tournament.
On the 27th, Takanofuji held a press conference on his own accord in which he wished to continue his active career.

Jaguar F-PACE gets its first major facelift... Possibility of hybridization (response) --Yahoo! News
Jaguar's first crossover SUV, the F-Pace, has been captured by cameras for the first time in southern Europe.
The F-PACE originated from the C-X17 four-seater concept SUV, which was unveiled in 2013.
Later, in 2014, a five-seater version was released, and it officially debuted as the "F-PACE" at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show.
The following year, in 2016, the current model, the first generation, was released, and this is the first facelift.
The captured prototype is covered in thick camouflage, but you can see some of the new design.
The headlights are designed to be more compact and thinner, and the side air intakes seem to have been modified to a sporty oval shape.
The grille is completely disguised, but there is no doubt that it will be redesigned.
At the rear end, you can see some of the revamped taillights, which feature elongated reverse lights at the top.
It seems possible that the design that wraps around the side like the current model has been modified to be more compact.
Inside the cabin, the company's Pivi Pro touchscreen infotainment system is expected to be installed, as well as a new digital cluster, HVAC control screen, steering wheel and gear selector that will be refreshed.
Powertrain options include a 2.0-liter inline 4-cylinder turbo diesel engine and a 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder Ingenium hybrid.
The world premiere is likely to take place in 2020.
A company that provides 300 million yen to a former assistant director in a surge in sales due to nuclear power plant-related construction|Shizuoka Shimbun ATS
Kansai Electric Power Company Head Office = 27 p.m., Osaka City (from Kyodo News helicopter)
In the case of Kansai Electric Power Co. Chairman Makoto Yagi (69) and others receiving money and gifts from Eiji Moriyama, a former assistant in Takahama Town, Fukui Prefecture, where the Kanden Takahama Nuclear Power Plant is located (who died in March this year at the age of 90), it was found that the local construction company that provided Moriyama with about 300 million yen had significantly increased its sales in the past few years due to orders for nuclear power-related work.
The construction company "Yoshida Development" was established in 1981.
According to a credit research company, sales in the fiscal year ended August 2013 were 350 million yen, but in the fiscal year ended August 2015, they exceeded 1 billion yen, and in the fiscal year ended August 18, they exceeded 2.1 billion yen.
Kanden's nuclear power plant-related work accounted for most of the work.

In the men's race, Tomoya Koseki (6th grade, Hirano Elementary School) took first place with a time of 3:04.38, and in the women's race, Ransei Shigama (6th grade, Isazawa Elementary School) set a time of 2:34.17 and Rin Asano (6th grade, Nagai Elementary School) finished second with a time of 2:35.73.
Mr. Koseki said, "It was hard to keep up with the fast Onsarigo, but I was able to endure it," and Mr. Shigama said, "Onsarigo said, 'Pick up the pace.'"
Onsaligo was delighted, saying, "The kids ran well, and I did a perfect job."
The tournament was organized by the Nagai City Elementary School Sports Promotion Association and other organizations to deepen friendship among sixth-grade elementary school students in the city, and was held for the 39th time.
Toshiyuki Nishida dismisses Akira Nakao as "a different level" "I appeared in Kohaku three times" ( Sports Hochi ) --Yahoo! News
Actors Hidetoshi Nishijima (48), Toshiyuki Nishida (71), Akira Nakao (77) and others greeted the audience on the first day of the release of the movie "Nintendo Gakuen" (written by Toshino Konno and directed by Hisashi Kimura) at TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku in Tokyo on the 27th.
A comedy with a unique and dense cast.
Nishida not only performed but also performed an arranged version of "Until We Meet Again" as an insert song in collaboration with the Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra.
To this, Nakao said, "The most frustrating thing about watching the movie was that Nishida was singing."
Nishida proudly said, "I've appeared in 'Kohaku' three times in the past, and if possible, I'd like to be called a singer rather than an actor. It's on a different level [from Nakao]."
He also promised to perform a live song, saying, "If the film continues to be a full house, then then."

The international art exhibition "Okayama Art Exchange 2019" (organized by the executive committee of the city, prefecture, etc.), which is held every three years in the center of Okayama City, opened on the 27th.
In keeping with the enigmatic title "IF THE SNAKE," art fans from Japan and abroad enjoy cutting-edge art created by 18 artists from 9 countries.
This year's event, the second in a row for 16 years, has welcomed French artist Pierre Huyghe as artistic director and developed works that make use of the climate and local resources of Okayama.
Approximately 40 works of art and three-dimensional works will be exhibited at 13 locations, including the former Uchiyamashita Elementary School (Marunouchi, Kita-ku, Okayama City) and the Tenjinyama Cultural Plaza (Tenjin-cho).
Prior to the opening of the event, an opening ceremony was held at the same small school, attended by about 100 people.
Executive Committee Chairman, Mayor Masao Omori, and Executive Producer Yasuharu Ishikawa cut the ribbon, saying, "We have a collection of works that stimulate intellectual sensibilities and stimulate imagination and creativity, and we hope that this exhibition will attract attention from around the world."
Families and field trips were able to stare at the snake-shaped robots that wriggle in response to ambient sounds in the schoolyard, and tour the school building, which has been transformed into the stage for a film depicting the world 3,000 years in the future.
I was enjoying art that took me to another world.
A 15-year-old first-year high school student in Tokyo, who is traveling with his father, said, "It's interesting to see a work that makes use of the atmosphere of the old school building, and it makes me imagine the time that passed in this place."
Closed on Mondays (or the following day if it is a national holiday) until November 24.

People gathered at the rally venue to mark the 5th anniversary of the outbreak of the "Umbrella Movement" = 28th, Hong Kong (Kyodo)
HONG KONG (Kyodo) -- Tens of thousands of people gathered in a park near the Hong Kong government headquarters in Admiralty on March 28, five years after the Umbrella Movement, a large-scale demonstration calling for democracy in the election of Hong Kong's chief executive, which was the largest base of protesters.
Around the venue, some young people occupied the main road and threw Molotov cocktails at the government building.
As the protests sparked by the proposed amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance continued, the participants renewed their determination to fight for the realization of "true universal suffrage," which was unattainable at the time.
The protests, which began in earnest in June, lasted for 112 days, surpassing the 79 days of the Umbrella Movement, and the protesters' demands expanded to include the "five major demands," including electoral reform.
