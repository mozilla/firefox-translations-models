Rabies in northeastern Thailand rise
Dr. Tawichhai, a doctor at the 9th Office of Disease Prevention and Prevention, said on February 9th that the number of rabies infections has increased in northeastern Thailand in the past few months, bringing the total number of people infected to 74.
In this fiscal year (October last year to September this year), a total of seventy-four people tested positive for rabies in the northeastern provinces of Sulin and Briram, respectively.
Everyone has received the rabies vaccine in the past.
He urges people to get the rabies vaccine with their pets and not to touch saliva in infected animals.
Rabies infects people not only from dogs, but also from cats and bats.
Almost one hundred percent of people die if they are infected and develop, but vaccination before onset can prevent death.

Located in the mountains, Park Chung Farm in Hamgyong-do, North Province, most of the fields are steep and the soil is not good.
Farms like this harvested more than usual last year.
▼The Seizu Central Zoo Feed Assurance Fisheries Plant has been a great achievement.
The business site was established in 2011 with the mission of sending seafood for feed to the central zoo in Pyongyang.
While exceeding the catch plan, in recent years it has supported farms in Kiyotsu City, such as the procurement of agricultural goods.
However, this time, the office supported not Kiyotsu City, but a farm in Kagamijo County adjacent to the city.
And I decided to help the "partition" of Park Chung Farm, which is said to be the most difficult condition in the county.

FUJI To prevent accidents from being left behind System development experiment with in-house vehicles|Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information of Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shizuoka
FUJI (Headquarters: Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent children from being left behind in the car.
When a motion sensor is attached to the car and the movement of the person is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with the pick-up vehicle of our own facility.
In the midst of painful accidents that cause leaving children behind, protect the safety of children.
Currently, two pick-up vehicles of the English conversation after school "teracoya THANK" for children operated by the company in Chiryu City are conducting a demonstration experiment.
A human-sensitized sensor that detects human movement from the temperature difference between people and the surrounding area is installed in three ceilings in the car.
When the vehicle's engine is turned off and the door is closed, it automatically sends a warning notification when it detects the movement of a person after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
By linking information with the state of the engine and the door, it prevents false positives as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling the registered number, it is displayed in the chat of the computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and mistakes such as missed are taken into consideration.
The experiment will continue until the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, chief of the second section of the Innovation Promotion Department, said, "During the experiment, we have seen peripheral issues other than the system."
For example, it was able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If you can expand the solution" can be put into force.
The trigger for the development of the abandoned prevention system was the abandonment of a shuttle bus nationwide.
Employees with young children suggested that there was something they could do to protect their children’s safety.
We decided to develop it in order to make use of the know-how such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors cultivated through FA (factory automation) related businesses.
FUJI's anti-replacement system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to pick-up vehicles, we aim to reduce the hurdle of introduction and spread it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Editor's note] The construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka, which was originally scheduled for FY2023, has been postponed, and it is beginning to affect the town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Obama City, where the new station is located, the location of the station has not been specified, and urban planning, including the maintenance of the surrounding area, is still stalled.
It seems that it will take a long time to formulate a plan, and it is necessary to publish it as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station scheduled for Obama City is the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In the 19th year, the Railway Construction and Transportation Facilities Development Support Organization showed that the base of the roughly station is about two or five kilometers in radius around JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The detailed location of the station and the determination of the route were aimed at the 22nd winter.
In Obama City, a full-scale project related to the Shinkansen in anticipation of the opening of Tsuruga and the opening of Obama in the future in FY21.
In the initial budget for FY22, we are planning to increase the number of projects further and promote town development in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the location of the new station has not been revealed yet.
The city plans to consider land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and to formulate a basic plan, which will include three million yen in this fiscal year's budget, but it is expected to be unexecuted.
Urban planning centered on the new station "takes time by building consensus among citizens" (city officials).
There are cases of Echizen City at a new suburb station in the prefecture that is not attached to the existing JR station, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to compile the overall plan.
There is concern that the later the publication is made, the shorter the preparation period until the opening of the business, and the more it will affect the surrounding maintenance.
Before the location of the new station, there is a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a citizen's group in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a signature to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) requesting the withdrawal of the blank paper of the extension plan.
In the Ishikawa Prefectural Political World, there were calls to reconsider the Maibara route, and there was a series of movements to return to the settled route setting, and it is difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is a monolith.
The way of receiving the work by the citizens of Obama is relatively calm, but the location of the new station is unknown, and there is concern that the opening time will be unclear and will affect the future momentum.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue the request activities to the government for the opening of the entire line as soon as possible, but the voices of the local areas that call for the start of construction as soon as possible will be indispensable.
With the indifference that "the Shinkansen will pass through someday (to the west of Tsuruga)," it is impossible to move the national and neighboring prefectures.
I want enthusiasm to keep my voice up.
Chocolate section for Valentine's Day, where tasting was revived for the first time in three years = February 9th, Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
Ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14th, the price of chocolate in-store has risen due to the soaring price of raw materials and packaging, and sales of high-priced prices are strong for their own "reward chocolates" for families and friends.
Retailers and confectionery stores in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that put their local colors, luxury, and attention to the ingredients in the foreground.
Seibu Fukui store (Fukui City) opened a special sales floor at the 6th floor event hall on January 25th.
Until the 14th, it has sold about forty brands, including ten confectionery stores in the prefecture.
It is said that sandwiches using local sake in Fukui are popular, such as sandwiches with raw chocolates and other items with cookies.
According to the store manager, the over-the-counter price of the product has increased by about ten percent year-on-year.
As for this year's trend, "There are many products that have come out with characteristics such as sticking to the material and putting a sense of luxury on the package. Consumer trends are tended to buy for themselves and their families and enjoy comparing meals."
Even in the midst of the headwinds of the price increase, sales in the high price range are said to be strong.
⇒Average increase of 25yen per grain due to high prices
"I try to create a sales floor where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself," said the person in charge.
The store has been selling recommended sweets that change daily from January 26th, and has resumed tastings for the first time in three years.
The Western Confectionery Club (headquarters: Ippon Tanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City), which manufactures and sells Western confectionery, launched the series of original chocolate "KISEKI" jointly developed with a long-established chocolate manufacturer in France for the first time in the Valentine's Day sales campaign at the end of last year.
It is characterized by its fruity taste that is particular about cocoa beans and suppresses bitterness, and is sold for three thousand yen and nine pieces for three thousand yen.
Mr. Ryoma Takakura, Director and General Manager of the company, said, "While the culture of giri-choco is gradually fading, there is a demand to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We will try to differentiate by increasing the added value of products."

A woman in her twenties (Fukui City) who visited the Seibu Fukui store on the 9th said, "I originally love chocolate, so I got a job and got money, so I want to buy it as a reward for myself."
A company employee in her thirties who bought Giri Choco said, “It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, but once a year, I want to give it to my family and people who usually take care of me. However, I may reduce the number of people who give it to me.”

The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle with Heisen-ji Temple = Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inukawa area of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, where there used to be a large-scale Ushigahara shoen.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built on the middle of Mt. Nabetoko in the area in order to prepare for the battle against Heisen-ji Temple, which was in conflict with the manor in the Kamakura period.
It appears in the military-recorded story 'Taiheiki.'
There are no documents about Ushigahara-jo Castle, but the following is written in 'Echizen Ushihara Jito' (self-harm) in the eleventh volume of Taiheiki.
Aikawa Ukyo no Suke-no-suke-ru, who was an official of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was dispatched to Ono as a jito (manager).
In the 1333s, the Rokuhara Tandai, which was established in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and rule the western provinces, was defeated by Takauji ASHIKAGA, and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was destroyed by Yoshisada NITTA.
When he heard the news that Rokuhara Tandai had been destroyed, Tokiharu's servants simply ran away, and only about twenty remained.
In response, the soldiers of Heisen-ji Temple attacked him.
When Tokiji brought his wife and two children into the river, he followed him and killed himself.
⇒ Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, Ieyasu stood together in an impregnable castle
The "Dry Side: A Association for the Morning of the Dry Side" is a group made by local residents.
The tragic story of Tokiharu is introduced in a manga so that even elementary school students can easily understand it.
Masao Kitagawa, 75, who was involved in the publication, said, "I want people in the community to know the history that is close to them and pass it on to future generations."

The roadside station "Rennyo-no-Sato Awara" under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture will open on April 22nd.
In anticipation of the opening of Ashihara Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen in the spring of 2024, the company expects to use about 36 million people a year as a new regional development and tourist base in the northern part of the city.
The main food and beverage and merchandise sales facility at the station is a steel-framed one-story building with a total floor area of 975m2.
The entire site area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and the Nagisa Children's Park, is 8137m2.
There is also a resting place and a tourist information center in the facility.
Electric bicycles can be rented and shower rooms are also available.
The two parking lots will accommodate a total of sixty-six small cars and three large cars (including three for the disabled).
The mayor of the city, Mr. Morinotsugu, made this clear at a regular press conference held on February 8th.
In the food and drink corner, parfaits using fruits from the northern hills of Sakai and pies with mitsumitsukin are sold.
He is working on developing a menu that uses plenty of local things, such as egg rice using Fukuji chicken and autumn-winter-only dishes using eel from Kitagata.
About sixty businesses are currently members of the "Shipper Council" of the direct sales office.
The range of processed products such as bento boxes and side dishes, as well as agricultural gardening products such as seedlings and plants are enriched.
In the souvenir corner, in addition to exhibiting and selling the works of the movees of the Kinzu Creative Forest Museum, we also handle sweets, sake, and traditional crafts.

A cat-shaped set-up robot introduced at "Iwashio-aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store".
Adorable expressions are said to be popular with family customers = Ote 2chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from labor shortages, there is a growing movement to introduce a food-sentible robot that carries food to the audience seats.
In addition to helping to save money on store operations and "non-contact" customer service to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the adorable facial expressions of robots are said to be popular with family customers.
Some restaurant owners and related parties have said, "Local restaurants are difficult to secure employees and part-time workers, and the food and service robots will become more widespread."
“Jin, gin, gin, gin genghis Khan.”
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face on the screen smoothly runs through the store with dishes on it.
When he arrives at the table of the audience, he talks to the customer, saying, "I brought my order's food, Nya."
"Iwashio-aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped set-up robot in August 2022.
When you place the dishes ordered by the customer and press the table number on the screen, they will drive to the table and deliver it autonomously to the table.
AI (artificial intelligence) voice function is built in, reacts when customers touch it, and the expression of the cat's face on the screen is rich.
The Bonta Group, which operates the store, has introduced a set-up robot at two stores, including the store.
President Toshiyuki Saito said that the reason for introducing it is "the biggest labor shortage" and that it is part of improving productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but the introduction has reduced it to 21 to 22 percent.
The robot also has the role of collecting dishes that customers have eaten, which has led to the efficiency of tidying up, and "family members and children are happy and have a publicity effect," he added.
The Rokuma Seiyama Fukui store, a yakiniku and horumon pot in Araki Shinbo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a set-up robot in August.
Mr. Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Songsan Shoten, who runs the company, said, "Even if you recruit employees and part-time jobs, it will not come easily. I thought that it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
At the Fukui store, the zone where employees are served and the range of robot delivery are separated, etc. are operated.
The cost of a robot lease is about the same as the wage for a part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store is also considering a self-checkout by incorporating a tablet ordering system in addition to robots.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the ratio of active job openings by occupation in December, "customer service service" such as restaurants is 6.94x, and the sense of labor shortage is high.
A person in charge of the net system (Takagi Chuo 2chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for the distributor of the set-up robot, says, "Due to the influence of the corona disaster, the shortage of restaurants in the prefecture is serious, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama said, "It will be even more difficult to secure employees at suburban stores in rural areas, and I think that the distribution robot will become more widespread in the future."
[Editorial] Echizen Town makes an ending notebook and distributes it to the townspeople who wish.
When he published the "Okuyami Handbook" last year, which covers the necessary procedures for his family, a write-out heritage list, and a family tree, he said that he was the only one who came to pick it up for himself.
In various parts of the prefecture, lectures on how to write ending notes and how to organize life are often held, and "end of life" seems to be firmly established in the prefecture.
The ending note of Echizen Town is thirty-five pages.
Chapter Five begins with a retrospective look at his own history, and describes his current health status and asset status, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section that follows what you want to do for the rest of your life and the message to important people.
It seems to be a painstaking to write that there are thirty-five pages, but you don’t need to fill all the pages.
What do you want to write most to your family and the people around you?
The key is to make the purpose clear.
At bookstores, etc., a variety of notebooks according to the purpose are commercially available, and it is good to start writing easily from the place where you can write.
It is said that the word end-of-life was born in 2009, comparing it to job hunting.
Two years later, the Great East Japan Earthquake struck.
It is said that many people have seen the reality that "death comes suddenly" and that more and more people are preparing for their own end and end times.
More than ten years after that.
The pandemic that struck the world has not subsided.
Prices have risen due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and electricity prices have jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high price, and many people are struggling with the future.
On the other hand, funerals, nursing care, and grave management, which were once shared by siblings and relatives, are now not uncommon for only children.
In addition, life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a long time ago, but the risk of dementia and nursing care increases as you get older.
It should be noted that the reason why the end of life has become established without end in a temporary life is that there is also such a rise in social unrest.
Everyone wants to be too burdensome on their partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword in the ending note, but don't be too self-righteous.
I don’t want to write down my wishes and requests, but I want to consult with my family once and be calm and prepare for that time.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from right) and Minister of Education, Culture, State Keiko Nagaoka (third) in a commemorative photo with officials at the elementary school where he visited.
At the graduation ceremony, he expressed the idea that wearing masks of students and faculty members is not necessary in principle = February 10th, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture
On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided at the graduation ceremony that it was "basic not to wear" the mask of the students.
The head of a junior high school at a large school said, "It is actually difficult to take a wide distance between students, and I am worried about how to deal with it. Some students are worried about removing their masks."
In response to reports about wearing a mask at the graduation ceremony, this topic has also been raised among teachers.
On the other hand, one elementary school principal said, "If the government decides, it will not be worn. If it is excluding the chorus, it will be realistically possible."
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to ease measures, such as allowing current students who have refrained from participating and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high school is scheduled to be held in early March, and the public elementary school is scheduled to be held in the middle of the same month.
The prefectural board of education and the municipal board of education will wait for a formal notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Supervisory Board of Japan and decide on the response.
In addition, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has been cautious about the decision to establish a policy not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities in general from this spring's new semester.
The elementary school principal said, "Children are also confused by the sudden response without a mask from one day. First of all, after deciding that 'wearing is freedom', it is a natural flow that the number of children gradually removing it gradually increases."
× × ×
On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided not to ask for masks to be worn in school education activities in accordance with the government's new guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, no masks will be used for chorus, physical education classes, and club activities.
In FY2022, we will seek infection control measures according to the current hygiene management manual, and we will inform the Board of Education and school sites from April onwards.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, high, and high schools, universities, etc., are based on the fact that graduates, faculty, and staff, and current students who participate do not wear masks after implementing measures such as ventilation.
Mr. Yasushi Nagata cutting the examinee (left) with scissors who prayed for passing = Hair Atelier Rimrim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
At the hair salon Hair Atelier Rim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, the examination season is cut by using scissors and other items that pray for passing.
It is said that the students were well received, saying, "I became confident" and "I was able to calmly take the exam".
Yasushi Nagata, the representative director of the beauty salon, has seen and heard students open textbooks while waiting for a cut or express their anxiety about the entrance exam during the cut.
Therefore, "If it helps even a little" and 2014, we started cutting the pass prayer.
⇒The last day of the national public application
Every year, on the first day of work, the beauty salon is asked to pray for the success of scissors and combs at the Kose-sha Shrine in Wakatake-cho, the same city.
Eighty people get a cut every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are various types of examinations such as job hunting exams and driver's license examinations.
I am giving you a pencil that I have prayed for.
⇒Ogi Mom "To you who challenge the high school entrance examination"
A 19-year-old man who passed the University of Tokyo's active work in the 21st year recalled, "I was happy to receive the feeling of support. I was inspired by the use of the golden pencil I received in the entrance examination."
A book self-published by the NPO "A Heart-revering Text and Editorial Bureau" "Dear Prime Minister "The Breakwater of Life" from Tojinbo"
"Dear Prime Minister of Japan, From Tojinbo, The Bulletwater of Life" I self-published my 10th book under this title.
Newspapers across the country have taken up it, and many readers have sent their impressions.
The purpose of this book was to share with everyone what we heard directly from the suicide attempt on the cause of suicide in Japan, regarding the "social and structural" environmental issues, and to create a "comfortable society".
We have been patrolling the border of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which has been called a famous suicide spot for eighteen years and ten months, and continuing support activities until we find, protect, and restart suicide attempts.
This book summarizes the problems that have been heard from the 784 people (as of 2/6) that have been protected so far, and we are appealing the following seven items to the Prime Minister regarding the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) There is a lot of "human rights violations" behind the suicides.
(3) A suicidal person is a victim of social and structural organized crime.
(4) The administrative organs treat the people living outside the jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) It is treated as an "accident" even if a person with a mental disorder such as depression is drugged and commits suicide.
(6) The "duty of safety consideration" in high-risk areas of suicide is forgotten and runs into commercialism.
(7) The part that cannot be scientifically proven by the doctrine of a new religious organization is deception, and the act of threatening the other party and threatening the other party to provide money and goods is extortion.

Therefore, in the impressions received from people who subscribed to this book, "I was moved by the strong mentality of the people who are working on this activity", "This former police officer is a picture of a police officer", "It is a living Bodhisattva who supports everyone else, like his family", and we have received some comments that are too much for us.
When I looked at the photo of the newspaper article, I burst into tears, "What do you think?"
I've heard that suicides are now on the rise of people who have been cornered by the Covid pandemic.
It's a really sad thing.
Everyone is like that person.
I want it to be a society where I can live my life happily.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all the staff who are doing their best to those who have the pain of dying.
I think that this activity is an activity that is overused both physically and mentally, but please continue to speak to me in the future because you are self-loved.
Thank you very much.

Kenji Shimada, who shoots capybaras almost every week and posts photos on SNS = February 1st, an indoor facility "Hapijan" at Ashiwayama Park amusement park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
There is a man in the city who takes a picture of the capybara of Hapijan, an indoor facility in Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, every week and posts it on Instagram.
The post features a variety of thumbnail images, including the moment of yawning through a large mouth and yawning, and the figure of lying down and yawning.
He has more than ten thousand followers both in Japan and overseas, and he plays a role in getting to know the charm of Hapijan and Capybara to many people.
⇒Shizuka Kudo posted traditional vegetables of Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The man is a company employee living in the city, Kenji Shimada, 38.
In March, we started posting on social networking sites (SNS).
Capybara is one of the world's largest rats, and has water between its fingers and is good at swimming.
Since its opening in Hapijan, three horses have been raised, one male and two females, and can be observed and fed up close.
Mr. Shimada learned about capybara five or six years ago.
When he saw the video of him relaxing in the hot spring, he was shocked and said, "What is this animal?"
It was drawn to the charming expression and gestures like a human being.
After that, I heard that it would be bred in Hapijan, and I was looking forward to seeing it soon.
About three years ago, I bought a SLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable figure of the capybara, and the shutter opportunity such as the appearance of shaking the body and cutting the water like a drill is not missed.
The number of posts on Instagram has risen to about 830, and I look back and say, "I took this much picture well."
Did you learn Mr. Shimada while you were passing by, but you of the male yamato will come up to you and make a cry of "Kyuru-kyuru".
"It's cute and I'm happy," said Shimada-san, while his love of kapybaras continues to deepen.
Through SNS, he enjoys interacting with capybara lovers from all over the country, such as showing each other the best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who visits the zoo in the nearby prefecture to see the capybara, said with a smile, "I want to continue to shoot and transmit photos mainly on Mt. Ashiwa at home."

It originated in 1890, when the Ottoman Empire sent it to Japan in the warship Ertuğrul accident.
The fact that the residents of Kushimoto-cho, Wakayama Prefecture in the area of the scene helped and cared for the crew, such as movies and novels ▼About a hundred years after this accident, Turkey dispatches a Turkish aircraft to rescue Japanese hostages by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War, and repays gratitude.
For those who have experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake, this suffering can be shared.

Introduction of the predecessors of plant research Hayaike Mineyama collection materials City Cultural Properties Center Special Exhibition [Hanamaki]|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
A special exhibition "People who introduced the flowers of Hayaike Peak - Hayaike Peak Plant Research Koshi-" is held at the City Cultural Properties Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City until the 12th.
It collects twelve valuable specimens collected by its predecessors and introduces the footprints of their predecessors involved in the study of plants in Mt. Hayaike.
Plant research at Mt. Hayaike began with Karl Johan Maximovic (1827-91), a Russian plant researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Chonosuke Sugawa (1842-1925) from Shiwa-cho, who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovic.
Maximovic, who was not allowed to walk freely in Japan because of foreigners, asked Sugawa to collect and continued his research based in Yokohama and Nagasaki for three years.
Sugawa also supported his research after returning to Maximovic, and led to the announcement of "Himekozakura", "Nanbu Touchisou" and "Miyamayama Yamabuki Shoma" unique to Mt. Hayaike.
After that, modern plant taxologist Tomitaro Makino (1862-1957) announced "Nanbutano", "Koba no Tsumekusa", "Nanbu Inunazuna" based on the collected products collected by local researchers in 1903, and "Katohakobe" which he himself climbed Mt. Hayaike in 05 (38) and discovered and named it.
From the exhibition materials, it can be seen that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
He also introduced Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874-1948), who was studying plants at Hanamaki Elementary School, who accompanied him on the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 27 years, and Shichiro Tamagawa (1914-88), who worked as a curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum and was also involved in the publication of "Hayaikemine Plants".
Sohei Yoshida, curator of the center, said, "There is a lot of research and connections between people behind the names of each plant of Mt. Hayaike. We can trace the connections between researchers from rural areas to across the country."
The exhibition consists of four chapters, and in one chapter, the faith and history of Hayaikemine, and the second chapter also focuses on the characteristics of Mt. Hayaike from the geological point of view based on the survey by Heinrich Edmund Nauman (1854-1927), a German geologist who built the foundation of Japanese geology.

Masahiro Okubo, president of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), which is responsible for the bureau management, said, "By doing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we can move to attract people to the whole island and create a flow."
In contrast to the normal real estate procedure, Sakasama real estate is a mechanism that discloses the information of the person who wants to borrow and contact the lender, and if an agreement is reached, it is contracted by each person.
It was operated by On-Co (headquarters in Mie Prefecture), a company, as a demonstration experiment that is responsible for the discovery of potential vacant houses and the construction of relationships through vacant houses.
The bureau was the 7th in Kyushu.
It is the first time in the country on an island.
About twenty people, including On-Co and Tsuginova staff, town hall officials from Wadomari and China, and local residents, participated in the event.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background of the opening of the bureau, saying, "As the movement to attract people from outside the island becomes active, I thought that if we could make use of vacant houses and vacant stores, the town would be more exciting from there."
"I would like to connect with people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and we want to help as many people as possible to promote that effort," he said.
On-Co representative Takeshi Mizutani pointed out the precautions when managing, saying, "We need to cherish each vacant house and discuss how local people want to come to this area, what kind of people we want to come to, and what to choose based on."
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered," he said, calling on the islanders to participate in the discussions and cooperate in providing information.

yes.
When will the tax return be transferred to my account?
I think I’ll be transferred in about 2 or 3 weeks.

Good evening.
"Ticketless Limited Express Ticket" of "e5489" of JR West will be paid by credit card.
You cannot use a prepaid card.
It’s been a long time, but are you okay?
It's vegetable juice.
It also depends on how you preserve it.
If you put it in the refrigerated, you can drink it after 2-3 days, but if you leave it outside or leave it at room temperature, I think it is better to dispose of it.
If something changes your body later, it will be difficult.

Can you enjoy the movie promise of Neverland only in the movie, even if you do not know the contents before and after?
Enjoy it.
It's a simple story.
Can I write it? It is a story of running away from monsters that feed humans.

About Instagram.
I (the general public) now have about ten thousand followers, but if you see someone who doesn't know this, do you think it's amazing?
Or do you not think about anything?
How do you feel?
I think it's amazing.
It is a miracle in the general population.
I think he was doing something special.
Frustration due to problem
I bought it to rely on the trendy pressurized inner because I can not take enough time to exercise.
The body shape is H175m W80kg I bought an L size.
It's quite a hard time at first to wear it, but I think it's okay if you get used to it.
I used it for a few days, but now I use other pressurized inners due to problems.
The problem is one, if the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the second arm) becomes too tight and a little congestion before the cuckood, it is a itchy.
2, Lower abdomen is loose The use was stopped due to the problem of more than two points.
It is quite tight in terms of comfort, but it is no problem to sleep while wearing.
Save money for those who agree
158cm, 50kg was OK.
But the skeleton was large and did not fit me, which was muscular.
Since it is not a three-dimensional construction such as the buttocks, strange gaps can be made and it does not fit easily.
I always felt like I had to go up.
I think it would be nice to have a body type like a stick.
Do you think it’s a reassuring thinness?
It was not a feeling that seems to break, but I was able to boot in even with perfect knee-high boots and I was able to make it refreshing.
nice.
I don't want to get too much skin on my upper body, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit and I met.
On the top, the back of the braided figure and the one-point mark on the hem are fashionable.
I'm happy to choose from two ways, whether I wear a bikini or shorts from it (^.
^) I just arrived, and I just tried it on and it was not in the water, so I don't know what it would be like if it was durable or wet, but the sewing was beautiful, the fabric was solid, and the price of this was a bargain.
There was no wire in the bust part, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a hard core at the bottom of the putt.
However, it does not hurt even if you wear it, and it will follow the bust properly, so I think it will be good when you move.
Did you change the model from a pat to another?
(^.
^) From now on, I was looking forward to going into the water ♪ Thank you ♪
It is a little larger in 45kg 156cmM size.
The raincoat is thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but I think that it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
There were two bait-proof visors, which prevented my face from getting wet.
The strength was fine, and I was able to use it with peace of mind even on a bicycle in the storm.
It was not broken after use.
I put it in a compression bag and carry it in a compact state.
It was really more than I expected at this price.
I was able to put it on safely.
It was fitted to the CLA 180 shooting break in the 2016 model.
It is also possible for amateurs if you read the YOU tube or the instructions.
If you loosen the torque screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I fell one and went missing.
Also, when you pinch the gray connector between the brown and red-green wiring, if the tip is a tipped type such as a precipient, the power will not be evenly applied and the plastic will be broken as shown in the photo and you can not wear it.
When I call support, the next day I mail a new cable and it is a company with very good support.
At the time of the re-challenge, I worked well if I put my efforts at once with a wide pliers like the one in the description.
When returning the last main unit to the car, it is a little tight for the storage of the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After wearing it, DVD, TV, and navigation can be seen while driving.
If you ask at Dailer, it will cost over eighty thousand yen, and even a specialty store will cost over forty thousand yen, so I think it is a product with very high cost performance.
Price less
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated First of all, it's a poly, but it's cut in a cushion and there are fluffy and skasuka-like parts. It seems that it has already been worn out. Or rather, overall, I thought that I tried it out, but I thought that the product with the head and the pillow part is integrated, but I think that it would not be suitable or not to use it for a trial, I thought that the pillow and the pillow would not be different, but I would like to return it in the time sale.
it's not necessary. it's not necessary.
The goods arrive.
I had to use it quickly.
There is no problem with the feeling of use, it can be milked properly.
However, there are times when I feel that the sound is a little annoying, and the reaction of the power button is bad.
I don't mind because I can use it without problems, but people who are interested may be concerned.
It is not super quiet 😅 If you use it in the middle of the night, you may be a little careful.
Also, I was worried whether the part connecting the included tube with the machine would enter the tube, but I entered in the form of pushing it 😂 I think it is easy to carry because it is lightweight!
You need a trick to whisk...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair quality or whether it's a problem with the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't foam at all in a normal way.
(The shampoo I used until now was foaming without problems even if I used it normally), and here is the solution I found. 1First of all, I pick up the shampoo less than usual and make it fit all the hair.
(At this point, not a single foam will appear at the level that does not appear.) 2Once you wash your hair, then take the shampoo in an appropriate amount of hand and blend it into your hair.
Well, in short, it is twice washing lol Since the capacity of the shampoo itself is quite small, the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo for the first time as much as possible ...
It is clear that I bought a high shampoo so far, but clearly I felt that the texture of my hair was better.
However, it is an honest impression that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
The Quattrobotanico series is a pity because it was taken care of by the face wash goods ....
Even though the capacity is small, the poor cost that can be washed twice.
In addition, considering the fragrance that seems to be full of suffocation, we will make it two stars in a slightly strict manner here.
Difficult to evaluate
There are negaposi, and the evaluation is difficult.
The front side of the blade will be cleaned with the cleaner of the blade.
I think that it is good to match with a razor with good accuracy of the original blade.
Posi: As intended, sebum, soap, etc., dirt on the blade can be removed.
(Although only on the front side) It will last longer if the sharpness is worse with the dirt.
Nega: The life of the smooths is extremely reduced.
Titanium coat, ceramic coat, etc., which are coated with the cutting edge, make it easier for the coating to peel off.
(If you use the shaver two or three times, the coating will almost peel off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner afterwards.)
Be careful with the razor that says you should not wipe the cutting edge.
It can be substituted with a fall prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) under the furniture used as a preparation for an earthquake, so it is a cost I feel like it is in terms of performance.
※I use it and the life of the razor is up to 20 to 30 percent.
It is difficult to judge when throwing away the blade of the razor, but I think that the damage to the blade is added by shaving, and the cutting edge becomes rattling.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent the sharpness down by dirt.
(There is no effect of sharpening with a cleaner. Sometimes it feels sharpened, but I think that it feels like a small rust can be removed.)
I was caught in a TV commercial...
I saw a pretty elderly woman's face pulled up just once I painted it in a TV commercial, and I bought it.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little more solid than a normal gel, and I wiped it off with pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels disgusting, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will enter your skin unexpectedly.
Since I entered, there was almost no stickiness, and my skin was like sucking on my hands.
The lifts didn’t look like TV.
I felt the feeling of slur once.
Because it is super dry skin, this one is still not enough, and I used a certain moisturizer surge72 before this.
It just feels moist.
I was hoping that the pores would be covered, but they will not be covered.
I think that it will be effective if you use a bottle or if there is a lipi.
The work was difficult to put together, but...
I look back at the comments of the politicians of the past few years.
As I read it, I somehow agreed that that statement at that time was a uh at the end.
However, considering the value of reading, it is subtle whether it can be said that it is enough to say that only the "fact check" called by the authors is enough.
To be honest, I don’t have any fun reading it.
I’ve thought about it a lot, but I feel that the big weakness of this book is the way.
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call “fact” here is forever true.
I felt that it was quite suspicious from the writing whether they were aware of the fragility of "fact check" (or whether it is a disprove possibility).
When the current perception of "facts" by Japanese reporters is at this level, it makes me feel a little sloppy.
It seems that many people are recommended, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge of the contents handled by this book.
If there are readers like reviewers who are interested in the "fact check" conducted by the current Japanese media, I think this book will not fit.
For those who do not increase the number of points in the test.
In my school, the political economy was a print method, and it was really boring in the form of a class that felt like studying while being done, and I suddenly became hated on political economy.
To be honest, this book saved me.
This year’s third year’s center.
I bought it in March and then chose this as my partner for an hour of studying from school to school.
First impressions are easy to understand.
We are in God’s kingdom.
After one lap, I was asked a question in the past, and at that time, the average was forty, and I was seventy.
I was surprised by the stone itself.
It grows like eating something strange.
What I can get from this reference book is not only knowledge and information about politics and economy, but also the ability I have and the motivation to study.
Thank you for really letting me meet you.
Security
I tried to pick the door twice eight years ago and have done crime prevention measures.
This is a replacement from a camera I bought eight years ago.
Previously, I used the 30m infrared irradiation type (other companies).
This product was written by others, but the distance that can recognize the face at night is about 5m.
I agree with you too.
I have just arrived and have not set it up, but I have compared the state of the camera and checked the problem.
It’s much better than the camera of eight years ago (of course).
I displayed it in four parts on a 32-inch monitor, but if you maximize the shooting size, it is a problem.
So far, there has been no shortage of products.
If you are considering a level that can recognize your face other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with shooting at night, especially at this price, which is the highest level!
I'm a security guard, but I don't even ask for facial recognition.
If you wear a mask or mask, you don’t know (especially at night).
A professional burglar has knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems that high-performance cameras and recording can be distinguished.
On the other hand, you will be in trouble if you are not a professional.
However, since the recent burglars are bold and clever, we recommend not only relying on cameras but also in combination with various crime prevention goods.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained for about 1,500yen at the home center (the latest is very bright, with six units attached).
Since it is solar, there is no need to pay for electricity, but it does not light up until the morning in winter, so there are three 100V humanized LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30m that can recognize the figure.
In addition, if you think that the camera is small due to security during the day, you can feel that the intimidation effect will fade, you need to cover with ingenuity.
I'm putting up a "24-hour security camera" sticker.
It is an original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
It is more effective for manufacturers than to paste what is sold at the home center.
The place to paste is the entrance path of the thief who will not be able to cover it by camera shooting.
This time, I wanted a sticker.
At the same time, it was negative because it was difficult to understand the arrangement of the net setting.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up and setting, we will add it.
The more hard it is to read, the more sympathetic
If she had been born in Japan for eighty-two years, the social situation might be a little better than her, but the situation is still far from equal just because the Equal Employment Opportunity Act has been enacted.
As I read on, the painful memories that I had survived as a member of society as a member of society came back and became suffocating.
It depicts the suffering of not only Korea and Japan, but also all women who try to live as human beings, not as women, in a feudal society.
Isn't it time for women to stop their emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder?
Drama that makes you think "man is the worst"
The story of a hero who was sexually abused by his real father when he was a child.
Of course, even as an adult, he continues to drag his wounds.
All the men who come out are the worst.
The husband of the main character, who seems to be a gentle and family member, is also the worst in a sense.
There is a spoiler ↓ Even if you know that the main character's sister is receiving DV by her husband, ignoring it, the sister-in-law finally came to the police to appeal her husband with courage, but the husband of the main character who is a police officer is through, etc.
The old mother, who pretends to be blurred, knows that her husband (the real father of the main character) was killed by her daughter, but she does not know it (publicly, the death of her real father is a drug overdose).
In short, it seems that the daughter was not consulted after the death of the rape father, and it is natural that the main character will go crazy.
Do you want to know about your daughter’s dead grandfather?
Do you care about the old man who died so young?
There’s too much drama.
A few years ago, a heat wave hit France A lot of elderly people died, and many French people said that even if they contacted their daughter and their daughter, "I can't take it out because I'm on vacation", and it was reported that the morgue in Paris was full.
These people are "dry."
I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, and I felt that it was "dry" after all.
France is completely different from the United States, etc., and many of them give a good aftertack of the shady part, but I saw a scene where it is better to cut this, relatively fast forwarding.
Professional Boundaries
If the detailed calculation and the unexpected accident that could not be read were related to someone's life, I would have prepared that even if I had calculated from the beginning to some extent, I would have been prepared to bet on my own.
The script that embodied such a drama that swayed her, such a fine mind, was wonderful, that she fought against her own struggles that she did not show in public, and how much she deceived her surroundings in order to pass her own beliefs.
Jessica’s performance is really great.
No matter what you look at, there is no slack.
It's really a professional job.
The feeling of use and then it broke down.
I have used three so far, but this product was broken in a good or bad way.
The reason for choosing this product was using the built-in vepoiler of the first 2200mA, but the battery ran out in the 200th 5min 3rd session.
The second USB port is bad.
It is not possible to charge.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but after re-installing the battery about fifteen times (the battery was used with the charger so that the USB terminal does not break), the contact became worse, and it became difficult to turn on.
When you press the lid, the power is turned on.
If you are an Icos user, you may have experience.
That's the symptom.
As you can see in the note, the battery does not use any batteries other than the attachment.
The nails and catches are like shavings, so there seems to be no bending.
So I returned it in about ten days.
I bought a Starry logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the contents compared with this.
It looks the same size.
The same goes for chambers and draws.
Liquid crystal This one is more beautiful.
It may be newer than the logo.
Vibe This is a modest.
Like a smartphone vibe.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibe or the sound is big.
A cheap Chinese phone.
This product is also Chinese...
The attachments are a little different.
This is the case of the liquid.
Without logo, it is solid like steel wool.
Roughly that kind of thing.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks down quickly, the credibility will be lost.
I wanted to exchange, but I could only choose the return, so I proceeded with the procedure.
Only ear rubber, but ear rubber
This rubber doesn't really hurt.
It is the best mask of the same system that I have used so far in terms of good ear contact.
Even with flat rubber, it is twisted, and the twisted helicopter part is rubbed at the base of the ear, which may hurt more than the round rubber, but this product is not only soft to feel, but I think that the length is just hard to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is good, and it is not only a three-dimensional fit, but also it is difficult to feel the difficulty of breathing because there is a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the chin = in front of the mouth.
It’s because it fits your face.
I don't know if it suits everyone in the same way, but I think that if you think that it is a small size other and you think that it is not good, you should try it once.
When I opened the outer box, it was in the central slit vinyl like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides was caught and it was difficult to take out, so I reduced that amount by one star.
Dealing with the dealer is a star one.
The price and taste are perfect, but despite the fact that it was specified by the date, I was distrustful of the response of the suppliers who ignored it and sent it.
I bought a drink other than this product.
I always know the delivery person to buy it from Amazon.
In order to carry heavy objects to the top, we took care to adjust the arrival date as much as possible, but it is ruined.
It is said that the shipping company is difficult because of Amazon, but I think that there is only one thing that users can cooperate with.
I'm disappointed by the arrogant dealership.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering purchasing, it will include the cost of disposal.
I think that there are many dissatisfaction and can not be used for a long time.
I think it is better to consider the cost when it is disposed of.
As a reference, it seems that some municipalities have a center that accepts free or inexpensive bulky garbage if they bring it in.
[Sitting] The seat surface is slightly tilted to the left and it is slacking further, so it is very tired to sit.
If you move a little, there will be a loud noise.
It is noisy and can not be used at night.
This is the most difficult thing, and I feel that I can not continue to use it.
[Assembling] The assembly instructions are only descriptions with a rough picture.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
There is no explanation of the orientation of the seat surface and the fixed stand, although it is written that it is tilted forward in the review, there is a possibility that the orientation when installing the seat surface and the post fixation is the opposite.
When installed correctly, the lever for height adjustment is backward on the right side, and the dial that adjusts the direction of the spring on the back is forward.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural in the positive, many people will attach it incorrectly.
There are no basic precautions in the instruction manual, and it will be assembled while trying and making errors while looking at the miscellaneous pictures.
There is an error in the description of the contents The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who look for an 8x20mm screw with twelve attached.
The 8x20mm screw has already been inserted on the chair side, so you need to be careful not to look for it in vain.
It seems that there is a combination that has a low work accuracy and can not be inserted with the same screw hole and screw.
In one combination, it is very difficult to insert a screw into a screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with the screw inserted in this way.
I also didn't see any spare screws in the instructions.
[Others] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring, and it is white in some places, so it is better not to expect something beautiful like the product photo.
The explanation that the instruction manual is incomplete and the supplementary explanation of the above installation method arrived at the e-mail address registered on Amazon two to three days after the arrival of the product.
This should be done immediately after the shipment of the product.
In two to three days after the arrival of the product, many buyers have completed the assembly, so it is a completely meaningless act.
Hmm,
I'm a big fan of thermos and have been using the thermos straw type for over fifteen years, but this model is the most difficult to use.
1The drinking mouth parts of the straw are made of a harder material than before, and the grooves are addicted to the main body, and the drinking mouth parts of the straw can no longer be taken from the main body!
And they will be smitten with their nails.
2Only the tip of the drinking part of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush is no longer inserted.
3The mysterious part of the valve attached to the end of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and is difficult to wash dramatically.
I haven't had any complaints about using the straw type so far, so it's a bit of a shock.
Not being able to drink from the body is really stressful.
The good thing is that it has the same cooling power as always.
When I left it out of my bag and washed it the next day, about half of the ice I had put in the day before was still there.
I don't drink Hot, so I'm still a straw type guy.
In the next model, please improve.
First review (with postscript)
I will review it for the first time.
(It is a impression of amateurs who have little knowledge to buy a doll from scratch for the first time and wear a doll eye for the first time.)
I was attached to the obitdor, and it was very cute and the light was very satisfied.
However, when wearing (the entrance) is a little hard and hard, you can not install it unless you push it.
I thought it was a different way, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping Since it was the first time to ship from overseas, I was looking for three weeks, but it arrived on the 8th (Narita Airport is close) earlier than I thought.
I was worried because I had never sent a shipping email.
If you look at the Amazon shipping statement earlier, it is still written that it is still being shipped.
There was no air in the eyes, and there was a lot of petit on the back of the envelope, and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it was safe for the time being.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is an email from overseas?
I had a question, so I decided to give it a second.
I think that the product is very profitable if it is this amount at that price without any problems.
Postscript Doll Eye 8mm model iPhonese
It is a little small (the work area is narrow), and the static is terrible
I ordered the size notation after seeing it, but I felt that it was about two times smaller than I imagined.
It is larger than the A4 size, but the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I was thinking of using it when repairing electronic devices and making gunplas, but it is difficult to use without the B4 size as expected.
If you use it only for the work of sanda goro, and other tasks such as assembly and disassembly can be done if you use another tray or mat.
In the magazine size area, it is impossible to put tools, put parts, and work more ....
I thought about ordering another thing and making it double the area, but it is too high-charged during the work, and all the pieces of dust cut are sucked, so I think it will be tough to continue using it for a while.
Fatal defective product
After the lid of the battery box did not open and it was hard, I finally opened the lid with a rubber non-slip sheet, but if I tried to load and close the battery, it would not close anyway.
It's out at this point.
Highly Rated!
Will the battery box close?
If you add it, there was a small saran wrap affting instead of the protection seal of the product.
Could this be a second-hand item?
Speaking of explanation, it is only English that is written in a small piece of paper.
There is no explanation of the illustration and everyone does not know the operation method.
Maybe I should have other fingers...
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
Because I use it for pinky ring It is not perfect if I use it a lot, and it is a little tough ...
But I think it’s good to use it on other fingers.
I think it’s a good idea trader.
For a price.
Don’t ask for quality for this kind of product.
One of the flowers was broken.
The size is just right for the feeling I tried.
People with thick ears may be tough.
You might have bought something without a handle.
やばな
The design is good, but it's big when you put it on your hands. I wonder if the effect will not fade even if you put it on your feet?
In the winter, in the east...
As other reviews, the electric heat wire is only net 110x80, and the arrangement is not vertical but horizontal.
I wanted to warm up the entire futon, and I bought it because it was more expensive than the laying type, but it was bigger than it, but I couldn't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer, so I can't help it.
You can only use it in combination with the N-worm of hot water and 〇tori.
The quality of the blankets is out of the question.
it's well done.
It is small and has enough wind.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it will be fine if you do it as shown in the photo.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will be blown away by your own wind power, but if you lay a handkerchief, there is no problem.
If you use it outside / family, etc., you will not notice the sound even if it is "middle", but in the office it is not noisy even if it is "small".
It is necessary to divide it by offering when going out.
Also, even if it is "small" in the office use, the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for the scene where you get sweaty and run away to the family restaurant and cool down at once with "large".
However, when you throw it into the bag, the power button is rarely pressed and it may remain around without knowing it.
It is good to have ingenuity such as slightly pulling the button (sinking) or holding the weak of the first push to long press.
In the era of extreme heat that is dangerous to life, it is an essential item, so it would be helpful if you could make something better.
Multifunctional Light Speaker
It is the weakest warm color and is used in the bedroom.
Better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the luminance and color with a touch type.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with a gradation, so it is beautiful.
Also, if you touch one touch at your favorite color, it will stop in your favorite color, so you can light up according to your mood!
Since it is LED type, long service life can be expected.
In terms of sound quality, I think that my ears, who are amateurs, are satisfied enough.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it is multifunctional anyway.
At the top is a large speaker.
You can pair it with your mobile phone via Bluetooth, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
If you pair it with your phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
・Also, because it supports MicroSD, it can be linked with a personal computer and play music as an mp3 player.
Ink and piano practice
At the age of sixty-six, he started challenging the DTM to prevent blurring.
Buy audio interface and equipment.
At first, I was intruding, but I was addicted to playing the piano, and I was practicing every day.
I downloaded the sound source, but the protection did not work well, and I downloaded ASIO at the beginning, but the free piano sound source sounds good, so I use this for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel cheated by the look.
Is it a product that has a hit?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of Doushisha's office chair (bouncing type armrest) used for 4-5 years deteriorated and became tattered, so we considered purchasing it with a raised armrest chair with non-synthetic leather.
I searched for home centers and furniture stores, but there was nothing suitable.
I am worried that I can not check the actual product, but I compromised the appearance and price of the design and purchased this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
[Caution] The included hexagon wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I didn't know how to attach oil to the hexagon wrench, so I was in a hurry when the oil was attached because the main body was white.
Completed in forty minutes.
Completed and confirmed the product.
The bounce-up armrest is different from the left and right, and the left is heavy for raising and lowering, the right is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak in the fixed force and "clicks" and immediately drips with the sound.
The seat feels hard in the non-regenerating high density urethane foam, and it is not comfortable to sit (is it weak elasticity?
The mesh for the backrest part is harder than other companies' mesh chairs, and if you wear it thin, your back hurts.
The height from the seat to the ground was not 550, but the height of the seat was 530 (the height of the seat height is important for height) and the leg that supports the casters is not made of steel, so the durability remains in question.
Separately purchased cushions are laid, and the mesh fabric part is used by laying a towel ket because it seems that the deterioration (scarred) will come quickly.
I felt that the 186cm 80kg fit was only good for me, but other than that, I think it is a product with low satisfaction, and I also feel that it is a product that has a hit deviation.
After all, it may be better to sit and buy an office chair by looking at the actual thing.
Since there was an Amazon email of purchase greeting from the manufacturer, do you inquire about the armrest and headrest?
under consideration.
Well, is it like this?
The environment of the house, apparently the right swivel BS4K is likely to be seen, so I bought a 4K tuner of Pixela that was cheap without expecting much.
As an experiment, free broadcasts of right-turning, including NHK BS4K, have been seen, and at the same time, I have been able to appreciate it beautifully with Panasonic's 4K TV purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the image is clicked) Immediately after purchase, an update came and it became recordable, so I made a few reservation recordings and watched it, but I wonder if there is an influence of the external 2.5inch HDD, it is a situation where only the image stops and the frame skip occurs with playback.
The user interface is also not praised, but it is divided into "4K broadcasting can be seen".
By the way, during the reservation recording, it feels like you can only follow the recording program, and this area is also accepted as a positive function that can record in 4K on HDD.
You may be disappointed if you buy a lot of things, so don’t expect too much.
We expect it to be improved with updates.
Heat retention function is OK
I have only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it became warm in about two hours and it felt hot in two and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of the compact car and used it, but the fan sound is concerned when the idling stop, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell like a chemical that was still new or discharged from the fan, so I opened the window regularly and needed ventilation.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr of the part that passes through the shoulder strap is terrible, so you need to fold the burr with a negative screwdriver.
Really fragile.
Today, I suddenly broke down after two months of using it.
I liked the keystroke feeling and the size, but it makes no sense if it breaks.
I use a PC all day in the work of processing the video, but the volume becomes one hundred percent without permission.
Even if you put it down, it will return to 100 per cent in an instant.
Earphones are not easy to use due to pain in the ears, and it is also a volume that makes you feel uncomfortable using a PC at night.
It is like sending a signal every few seconds, and the volume display appears on the computer screen and disappears repeatedly.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so if you do not turn off the keyboard every time, you can not use the mouse freely.
Enterkeys and backspace keys also stopped responding.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it is a thousand yen, you can buy it for a try.
If you are lucky, you can use it for six months.
Compared to the one-year-to-three-year warranty, the third-party contract is guaranteed for six months.
The short warranty period tells the story of the fragility.
The best products, the worst packing.
The product is different color and I love it.
I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a food stocker! !
However, there was a gap so much that it rolled around on a large cardboard, and there was no delivery slip, so the packing was the worst.
The lid was also removed when I opened the box.
I recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about strength, but at least.
When I replaced the lid, the support was unforgivable, so I bought it.
It plays a role in the stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, make a bad sound.
You have to choose something that matches the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when purchasing.
Meat ball is cute back
I had a dog and was looking for a bag to go out, and I was attracted to the fashionable gray bag and bought this.
It was a assembled style, and when I took it, it was surprisingly light, so it was not so heavy even if I took it.
The fastener also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as catching.
It is also easy to travel for a long time.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
Even if you fold it, you can see the design of the meat ball, and it is cute even if you put it on.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love with the cheapness of the appearance and price immediately! I bought it immediately.
TSA lock is a favorite of the coco years and has a few others, but it is convenient.
And for masters of forgotten or lost keys, number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I am good because I have the most important point in lightness, but if you ask for strength and security, the fastener is a week, so it is a cloth, so it will be broken in an instant.
In addition, the alignment of the fasteners is sweet, so I want to devise overlapping.
If you are abroad, we recommend carrying it on board.
I used it on a bullet train trip, but it was comfortable.
It is difficult to choose the size...
It’s hard to buy shoes because it’s so wide.
Converse and buns are wearing 24cm.
The MRL996 is 24cm.
At first I thought it was tough, but it was okay when I got used to it.
This time, ML574 was really tough if my sister said that 24.5cm was tough and I was allowed to wear it.
I felt like my little finger was hitting me.
I bought 25cm for that.
When you open it, it’s big...
If you wear socks, relax a little.
I was worried about returning it, but if it becomes tough in 24.5, it will be troublesome, so I will continue to lay it in 25 and wear it.
I bought Team Red, but it's very good with a bright red!
There are many black and white monotone clothes, so if you wear this, it will be bright!
165cm, 40s Male
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if it is similar to the following specifications, we recommend the M size.
Height: 165cm Weight: 60kg West: 81cm around the navel: 100cm It is a typical metabolic belly.
<Useful> In the water, the rash guard will rise up, perhaps because the waist part is loose.
I'm swimming while repairing the raised part.
Especially when you are careful in the jacuzzi, the metabolic belly is in a state where you can see it.
Also, if you walk while exercising violently up and down, you will still get up and down from below.
<Product making> The fabric is not too strong and too thin, so there is no worry that the nipples will be transparent.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this making, but I think that it will be better if you buy a small one.
The gas was gone, but...
Silver Colt25 was still leaking gas, and there was a problem that part of the tank was missing when I changed the valve, but I was able to use [Bus Bond Q] to seal the tank and repair grease up, and I was able to hit it quickly, I can disassemble or assemble this Colt25, or I can disassemble it while taking a digital camera, so I can not recommend it much if I am not confident, or I may not be confident because I do not disassemble while taking a digital camera, but I may be able to break it.When disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, remove the two screws of the left body, remove the two screws of the left body, remove the tip of the barrel, and pull out by pinching the front site and the inner barrel with a plier so that it does not pinch the front site and the inner barrel.
I wondered what kind of quality 188yen was.
You can use it when you need early turn and torque.
It is light and small, and above all, it is simple without fashion.
There was no rattling when I installed the bit, and I thought that it would be amazing if it was 188yen.
What about durability?
It may not be used often, but I think it is good to put it in the tool box.
I bought it with the same seller, "1/4 inch hexagon shank magnetic quick release driver throat bit holder 60/100/150 mm".
No problem, or rather, it was pretty good for the price.
The controller stops working.
The machine itself moves and cannot be operated.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but as soon as a few minutes, it moves in a direction that does not have its own machine, and it becomes a symptom that it can not be operated.
It is better not to buy this product.
I will warn you all.
It's a terrible commodity.
It is wired, but I recommend the controller of the BEBONCOOL PS3.
It is reliable and has not yet broken even if it is used for a long time.
You can also use it for PC games.
. . . with the return of the Amazon gift certificate as a defective product within a month, I was able to refund the Amazon gift certificate, so I think that was good.
Does this increase your calculation?
I think it is suitable for children who understand the calculation.
Isn't it impossible if you are a child who understands the calculation to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, I will let the screen objects slide on top with my fingers, such as to give tools to my master, but I tried it myself, but no matter how many times I do it, it will not be smooth.
In short, it may be easy to slip to those who are accustomed to DS. ?
I don't like the illustrations of the cartoon people, or rather, I think that the DS etc. may enter from the fun of the screen, but for some reason I can not be familiar.
The calculation method is also a way of competing for time, for example, how many questions are answered correctly in several minutes.
I know how it feels to rush in the exam, but... don't you rush it and calculate it?
I don't like the reason why the gong rings when it's over.
Can you make a better sound while you are working hard?
I feel like I’ve lost six hundred pounds.
I know the price of this half.
Sorry, but for this reason, I’m going to have two.
After all, Persona's songs are good!
Persona III reaches ED.
Five played along the way.
Persona4 is troconed in vita.
What you can do has not changed from the previous Persona4.
There is no story, and it feels shorter than the previous one.
The song is really cool!
Just listening to it makes me feel better!
The characters of Persona3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Junpei looked handsome somehow (laughs) Persona5 is beautiful from the original, so there is no freshness ... If you think about it, three feels better.
As for the sound game, I felt that it was easier to play than three.
Persona3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
The five are mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if you wear it with the background.
There are many assist functions, so I think that even those who are not good at sound game can play.
If you are a sound game expert, turning on the challenge function may be a tough game.
There is a suntra in the triple pack, but it is not about the size of a omake, but it is a solid four-disc set, so if you like persona songs, we recommend this.
Something's wrong.
I liked the color of the dial in the photo and bought it, but the actual one has a bluishness, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double-smoked
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but so far I'm on hold I'm giving up because the price is cheap?
Postscript After the review was posted, we received an apology from the seller and an email saying that it would be exchanged for a new product.
The process was also quick after that.
I think the response was very good despite the cheap products.
Four stars to respond Postscript After that, I also bought gold.
I think the color is almost as beautiful as pictured.
But after all the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the explanation photo is obvious.
It's just a pity there.
The evening will be very heavy.
I used it for a SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setting, I did not know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport and told me (setting > mobile communication > turning on the data roaming from the communication option) and I was able to do it well.
It didn't seem to have much to do with the instructions that were attached to the product...?
However, the area around Gimpo Airport was in poor radio wave condition, so I was grasping 3G all the time.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
In the evening or at night, communication became very heavy from time to time, but now that I think about it, I may have reached the upper limit of up to hundreds of MB per day.
Better than I thought.
I used the SoftBank Z4 for two years, made it sim-free, and used it with Ymobile, and the Z4 got worse, so I was looking for a second-hand Xperia, and I found and bought this phone that can use my new mobile phone.
I was using mobile Suica, so I was worried about whether I could use it properly, but it was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so I have the impression that it is an iPhone6.
I don't do GAME, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, and I'm a little quick. In the review, I was told that fingerprint recognition is slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so I use it here because it takes a little bit of recognition.
I thought it was amazing that it was like an iPhone Android was also Ver9, and I was able to make a satisfying purchase.
I'm curious, it's a little smaller, no strap hole. I don't have a case with a strap hole. I'm not experimenting with water resistance. I'm a little heavy, I'm only using a little, but I'm happy.
