Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Many accidents occur when young people press the wrong pedal (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Violations that violate the Road Traffic Act
Although reports of accidents caused by erroneous operation such as pressing the wrong pedal are increasing and attracting attention, it would be a big mistake to think that this is a problem only caused by elderly drivers.
Looking at the number of accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal by age group (2015 National Police Agency data), the most common age group was 24 years old or younger at 1,080, which exceeded the 1,032 cases for 75 years or older.
Missteps are by no means more common among older people, so it is important to call on younger people to be equally careful.
Do you want to make your feet look fashionable?
Do you want to be safe?
This data does not include the gender ratio or the causes, but unlike the elderly, where it is thought that this is often due to physical decline such as driving skills and reflexes, younger people tend to be distracted by other things such as music or conversation. It is also possible that you made a careless mistake when pressing the button, or that you pressed the wrong foot due to your clothes.
In particular, some women choose a variety of shoes, such as high heels, pumps, sandals, and mules, depending on their outfit for the day, and then drive.
Some people know that their shoes are not suitable for driving, but find it troublesome to change them, but there are also many people who drive without any malice, without thinking about the possibility of it being dangerous.
However, driving in high heels or sandals is against the road traffic law.
One is Article 70, ``Violation of Duty to Drive Safely,&#39;&#39; which stipulates that drivers must ``operate the steering wheel, brakes, and other controls reliably,&#39;&#39; and ``must not drive in a manner that may cause an accident or harm others.&#39;&#39;
The other is Article 71, ``Violation of Public Safety Commission Observations,&#39;&#39; which stipulates that drivers must comply with the matters stipulated by each prefectural public safety commission.For example, in the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law Enforcement Bylaws, ``Do not drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) wearing slippers, slippers, high heels, or other footwear that may interfere with driving operations, or wearing footwear in a manner that may impede driving operations.&#39;&#39; ” There is a sentence.
All prefectures have the same idea that driving in ``footwear that may interfere with driving operation&#39;&#39; is a violation, even if high heels are not specified.
So why is driving in high heels dangerous?
This is obvious if you consider the basics of safe pedal operation.
In order to operate the pedals safely and reliably, first fix the heel of your foot on the floor, place your foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, and tilt your foot to the right using this as a fulcrum when pressing the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep your heel firmly fixed so that it does not wobble, regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, with high heels, the area where the heel touches the floor is small, causing the heel to constantly wobble, and because the height of the heel makes the entire foot angle, the area of the tip of the foot that makes contact with the pedal is also small. It becomes difficult to press firmly and make minute adjustments.
This is considered to be dangerous.
Also, most cars have floor carpets, but high heels tend to get caught on this material, so when you suddenly brake, your heels get stuck and you can&#39;t press the pedal, or your heels get caught and your high heels come off. In some cases, the pedal may get stuck in the back of the pedal and become impossible to press.
Furthermore, there have been cases where the heel of the accelerator pedal got caught on the back of the pedal when the pedal was depressed and then released, making it impossible for the accelerator pedal to return.

U.S. lowers number of refugee admissions to 18,000 for third consecutive year | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
[Washington Kyodo] On the 26th, the U.S. State Department announced plans to reduce the maximum number of refugees accepted from around the world to 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year (October 2019 to September 2020).
This is the lowest number since 1980, when the Refugee Act was enacted, for the third consecutive year.
With an eye on next year&#39;s presidential election, the Trump administration aims to appeal to conservatives with its strict immigration and refugee policies.
As the number of people forced to flee their countries continues to increase, criticism from human rights organizations and other organizations is inevitable.
The previous Obama administration set the cap at 110,000 for fiscal 2017, but the Trump administration, which took office in January 2017, reversed this and cut it to 50,000.
The number continues to decrease year by year, from 45,000 in 2018 to 30,000 in 2019.

Kinki Ceramics, which manufactures Awaji tiles, a local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, files for quasi-voluntary bankruptcy with debts of approximately 2 billion yen (Teikoku Databank) - Yahoo! News
The slump in the housing market and repeated damage from earthquakes led to consumers becoming less interested in tiled roofs.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB company code: 530173983, capital: 99.2 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, CEO Kozo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-voluntary bankruptcy with the Kobe District Court on August 30th. I applied.
The application agent is attorney Daichi Yoshida (Yoshida Daichi Law Office, 1-10-8 Nishitenma, Kita-ku, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture, telephone 06-6365-6038) and one other person.
Our company is a tile manufacturer founded in June 1895 (Meiji 28) and reorganized as a corporation in April 1961 (Showa 36).
Initially, the business started as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry on Awaji Island, in Seidan-cho, Mihara-gun (currently Minami-Awaji City) under the trade name Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd.
In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. At the same time, the company changed its name to its current name and moved its head office to its current location.
After that, sales offices were opened in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., resulting in the current structure. Previously, the main product was ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western tiles such as flat tiles are now used. 70% of the total amount was manufactured by Japanese tiles such as ibushi tiles, and 30% by Japanese tiles such as ibushi tiles.
The company has built a wide-ranging business base primarily in western Japan, including major house builders, building material trading companies, and roofing contractors, and posted annual sales of approximately 3,116 million yen in December 2004.
It was well known as the top tile manufacturer on Awaji Island.
However, demand has been sluggish due to the slump in the housing market since the Lehman Shock and repeated damage from earthquakes such as the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, which has caused consumers to move away from tiled roofs. Down to approximately 1,345 million yen.
In terms of profits, in addition to declining profit margins due to soaring fuel prices, the company was constantly in the red due to excessive interest-bearing debt due to inventory burden and capital investment, and was forced to face severe cash flow.
As a result, although the company was trying to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease loan repayment conditions, there was no sign that business conditions would recover and cash flow gradually became tighter.
At this point, we were unable to support the company and gave up on continuing the business, resulting in the current measures.
Debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be approximately 2 billion yen.

In the spring, I thought, ``I wonder if this is how I&#39;ll end, too.&#39;&#39; , I can&#39;t believe that I was able to come back from there and be in a better position.&#39;&#39; It was also a fulfilling season.
From around the beginning of June, I gradually started to get a feel for it.
``I was able to do more things every day, and I was able to do one more thing each day.&#39;&#39;
There was some trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses I had set up one after another, my condition improved significantly, and my results improved accordingly.
The fact that he was able to pitch all year without going on the injured list also gave him confidence.
Darvish, who has the right to opt out of his contract after this season ends, said, ``I have to think about it now. I&#39;ll talk to my agent and family,&#39;&#39; but added, ``Basically, I have no complaints about this team. It&#39;s fun.&#39;&#39;
Although he has not come to a final conclusion, his feelings seem to be firm.

&lt;One year since the Eastern Iburi Earthquake&gt; Installation of &quot;water taps&quot; directly connected to water pipes continues, securing water even during power outages Hakodate apartment: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition
Countermeasures are underway in Hakodate City&#39;s apartment complexes, where water was cut off following the blackout caused by the Eastern Iburi Earthquake in September last year.
According to the Water Supply and Sewerage Department of the City Enterprise Bureau, in the year following the earthquake, seven apartment buildings installed ``water taps&#39;&#39; that can provide water even in the event of a power outage.
There are approximately 400 condominiums and private apartment complexes in the city that are four or more stories tall and are supplied with water through ``water tanks,&#39;&#39; which can cause water outages during power outages, and the department is calling for countermeasures to be considered.
There are two main types of water supply systems for residential buildings: the ``water tank type,&#39;&#39; which stores water in a tank located underground or on the roof, and the ``direct connection type,&#39;&#39; which supplies water directly to each unit from the city&#39;s water pipes.
With water tank type systems, even if the water pipes are not damaged, if the electric pump that pumps water from the water tank to each unit stops working due to a power outage or other reason, water cannot be supplied and each unit will experience a water outage.

Is “beauty and ugliness” a thin line?
What is the image of a &quot;snake&quot; that overlaps with the beautiful girls in Kazuo Umezu&#39;s works? (Magmix) - Yahoo! News
What do mysterious beauty and a shadowy expression have in common?
``Kazuo Umezu Bishoujo Collection&#39;&#39; (Genkosha) focuses on the beautiful girls drawn by Kazuo Umezu, who has released numerous works into the world since the 1950s and is known as the leading authority on ``horror manga.&#39;&#39; was released in August 2019.
When I pick it up and look at it, I am once again reminded of the correlation between ``beauty&#39;&#39; and ``horror&#39;&#39; in Kazuo Umezu&#39;s works.
[Image] Is it attractive because it has a “shadow”?
Beautiful girls from Kazuo Umezu&#39;s works (5 photos)
There is a line in the prologue of ``Bishoujo Collection&#39;&#39; that says, ``The beauty of these girls stands out in contrast to fear, ugliness, and shocking scenes and developments in the story.&#39;&#39; , the expression changes to one of hatred and resentment... Perhaps it is precisely because of this contrast that the ``fear&#39;&#39; stands out even more.
The keyword ``snake&#39;&#39; is often used in Kazuo Umezu&#39;s works, and snakes can be perceived in a variety of ways, with some people seeing them as ``creepy creatures&#39;&#39; and others finding them ``beautiful.&#39;&#39; .
Some people in this world love reptiles, while others simply don&#39;t like them.
In this way, a snake may be a creature whose beauty and ugliness are two sides of the same coin, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer.
Additionally, this creature has been worshiped as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and it is said that a house where a ``white snake&#39;&#39; has settled will have good luck.
Umezu&#39;s works that use snakes as their subject include ``Snake Girl&#39;&#39; and ``Spotted Girl&#39;&#39; from the 1965 ``Mama is Scary!&#39;&#39; series.
Generally speaking, it is a beautiful woman with a dark side who becomes a ``snake woman&#39;&#39;.
In modern terms, you could call her a ``cool beauty&#39;&#39; type... ...I feel like that&#39;s a common feature of the beautiful girls who appear in Umezu&#39;s works.
Among them, ``Orochi&#39;&#39;, the main character of ``Orochi&#39;&#39;, which has been serialized in ``Weekly Shonen Sunday&#39;&#39; since 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be said to be representative of Umezu&#39;s works, but she is also a beautiful girl character who is said to be a character with eternal life and eternal youth. The fact that it goes into a deep sleep every 100 years to maintain its health, and that it has mysterious powers, somehow reminds me of a ``snake.&#39;&#39;

A screen shot of the Twitter account in which State Minister of Defense Tomohiro Yamamoto posted a comment along with a photo of Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense Kazuchika Iwata, which was later deleted.
By the 27th, Deputy Defense Minister Tomohiro Yamamoto had deleted a comment on Twitter in which he wrote, ``It&#39;s delicious!&#39;&#39; when he ate at a yakitori restaurant in Saga Prefecture.
Mr. Yamamoto arrived in the prefecture on the 26th to explain to the local government the results of the investigation into the crash of a Japan Ground Self-Defense Force AH64D combat helicopter in February last year in Kanzaki, the same prefecture.
On the same day, he tweeted, ``I came to Saga Prefecture on a business trip!&#39;&#39;
He posted a photo of Kazuchika Iwata, Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Defense elected from the same prefecture, who was also present at the meal, and commented, ``It&#39;s delicious!&#39;&#39;

[Koshiyama Wakasui] The circle of ``children&#39;s cafeterias&#39;&#39; that provide free or low-cost meals to children is expanding across the country.
According to a survey by NPOs and other organizations, this year there are approximately 3,700 active locations nationwide.
The number of locations has increased rapidly by 1.6 times compared to 2018, and there are now 24 locations within Fukui Prefecture, an increase of 9 locations from last year.
Why children&#39;s cafeteria now?
▼NPO chairman and social activist Makoto Yuasa spoke about the background and significance at a lecture held in Sakai City.
With the declining birthrate and aging population, the area is becoming lonely and the shopping district is in decline.
There are no more places for people to meet.
Therefore, &quot;there was a need for a lively local exchange hub where people could interact.&quot;
▼Although it is called a children&#39;s cafeteria, it is a ``place for multigenerational interaction&#39;&#39; where the elderly also participate.
This not only eliminates eating alone, but also supports childcare and promotes the health of the elderly.
Breaking the chain of poverty and revitalizing the region.
The important thing is to not create children who are rejected from this.
▼Various locations, ranging from those that provide meals once a month to those that provide meals every day.
The scale varies from a few people to several hundred people, and the venues range from private homes to temples.
An atmosphere is starting to emerge where people who want to do it can do it.
The appeal is that it is so easy to enter.
However, it is difficult to secure operating costs and staff.
Sometimes we hear about issues such as safe management systems.
▼However, Yuasa says, ``Your values change when you interact with many people,&#39;&#39; and ``Connecting with society provides a safety net in the event of a disaster.&#39;&#39;
It&#39;s like a ray of hope in a closed society.

The &quot;real culprit&quot; who attacked Saudi oil facilities by drone (FRIDAY) - Yahoo! News
&quot;The performance of the Iranian Ababil drone used in this bombing has been dramatically improved in recent years through analysis of crashed U.S. military drones.
It can be manufactured cheaply and has a cruising range of approximately 1000km.
One of its strengths is that it flies low, making it difficult to be detected by radar.&#39;&#39; (Toru Yokota, news photographer)
On September 14th, the oil facilities of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia&#39;s largest oil company, were bombed by 10 military drones.
Immediately after, Yemen&#39;s Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility for the attack.
“There is no doubt that Iran, led by President Rouhani, is behind the Houthis. Iran cannot tolerate its enemy Saudi Arabia profiting from crude oil when it cannot export its own crude oil. The aim is to let the international community know that if the oil embargo against Iran continues, there will be corresponding pain.&#39;&#39; (International political analyst Izuru Sugawara)
The bombing halted as much as half of Saudi Arabia&#39;s oil production and caused oil prices to soar 15%.
Some say that if things continue like this, the oil crisis will return.
“Since Trump has pledged to withdraw US troops from the Middle East, he wants to avoid military intervention at all costs, at least until after next year&#39;s elections. Knowing this, Iran will continue to hide behind the Houthis. However, the United States will not be able to hold back forever.There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future.&#39;&#39; (Sugawara)
The ``proxy war&#39;&#39; between the United States and Iran is reaching a crisis point.
The reason why a super unique YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Ask the CEO who hired you (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 delivery
A YouTuber who is currently extremely popular among young people.
It is now not uncommon for companies to hire YouTubers to advertise their products, but there is one company that has started an unusual system called ``YouTuber recruitment&#39;&#39; in which they hire YouTubers as full-time employees.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX) is a company whose main business is CRM (customer relationship management) for companies.
What exactly does it mean to &quot;employ YouTubers&quot;?
We spoke to Yuki Kobayashi, who is the CEO of DmMiX and also the representative of Staff First, the subsidiary company that actually hired YouTubers this time.
I want to support young people who are working hard by hiring YouTubers.
― ― First of all, how does “YouTuber recruitment” work?
Yuki Kobayashi (hereinafter referred to as Kobayashi): The job of being a YouTuber is now a dream of many young people.
It ranks high in elementary school students&#39; list of desired future occupations, and more and more young people will continue to aspire to it.
Up until now, our company has employed and supported young people who are pursuing their dreams of becoming band members or comedians.
In the same way, ``YouTuber recruitment&#39;&#39; is an attempt to hire and support young people who are chasing their dream of becoming YouTubers.
― ― When we think of YouTubers, we have the image of individuals who voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to “employ” them?
Kobayashi: While many young people aspire to the profession of being a YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers cannot earn the income they expected.
There are many creators who create and post videos while working part-time, and creators whose families do not recognize them as YouTubers.
In this initiative, we will provide the hired creators with a salary and an environment to create content.
The disadvantage of being a YouTuber is that it can be an unstable position at first, so we would like to support their activities by supporting them.

“I hope South Korea returns to GSOMIA,” says U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Korea and Japan Affairs Knapper gave an exclusive interview to the Sankei Shimbun at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador in Tokyo, speaking about the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) between Japan and South Korea, which is set to expire on November 23rd. I hope that South Korea will reconsider its decision to abolish the agreement and come back.&quot;
It is unusual for a senior US official to mention reconsidering the abandonment of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is concluded by Japan and South Korea, Japan and the United States, and the United States and South Korea, and serves as the basis for sharing information such as missile launch information.
South Korea announced in August that it would revoke the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information between Japan and South Korea will collapse.
Knapper argued that ``without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to a crisis.&#39;&#39;
``There is still time until the agreement expires,&#39;&#39; he said, strongly urging South Korea to return to the agreement.
Regarding the joint flight training exercise conducted by China and Russia over the Sea of Japan in July, he recognized the threat as ``a first in history,&#39;&#39; and added, ``The United States, South Korea, and Japan, who share values such as democracy and human rights, are working together as an alliance. It is essential that we continue to do so.”
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-South Korea relations &quot;hurts the national interests of the United States.&quot;
Although he said he had &quot;no intention of mediating,&quot; he said he would &quot;play a positive role in helping Japan and South Korea bridge the gap.&quot;

Tokai Nuclear Accident, 30 days marks 20 years, 300 nuclear facility troubles: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition
From 2000, the year after the criticality accident in Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture, which resulted in the first fatality due to radiation exposure in Japan&#39;s nuclear history, to 2018, there were 336 reports of accidents and breakdowns that occurred at nuclear power-related facilities across the country. This was revealed in an interview with the Nuclear Regulation Authority on the 28th.
30 days will mark 20 years since the criticality accident that raised alarm over the nuclear industry&#39;s safety myth.
The report found that although approximately 90% of the incidents were at level 0 (not important for safety) or not subject to evaluation on the International Evaluation Scale (INES), which indicates the severity of the accident, this accident and the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011 Based on the lessons learned, there is a need to constantly improve safety awareness.
Koichi Muneta completes the story and original illustrations for his creative picture book and is collecting donations for publication. September 18th, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture.
Koichi Muneta (64), an artist and member of the Echizen City Regional Revitalization Cooperation Volunteers in Fukui Prefecture, is making donations online with the aim of publishing an original picture book inspired by legends in the prefecture, in order to promote town development using picture books. We have started a crowdfunding campaign.
Muneta, who is originally from Hokkaido and started working as a member of the volunteer group in April of this year, is enthusiastic, saying, ``I want to convey the compassion of the people of Fukui, which is based on their deep faith, through picture books.&#39;&#39;
[Click here to donate] To convey the heart of Fukui.
Mr. Muneta is active as an artist who works on contemporary art with mathematics as a motif, and since reaching his 60th birthday, he has also been active as a volunteer volunteer.
After being involved in urban development in Nagano, Kumamoto, and Tochigi, he took up his post in Echizen City in April of this year.
In honor of the city that produced Satoko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, the city aims to use picture books to develop the city.
After living in the city, Muneta says, ``I was surprised by the depth of compassion of those around me, which I realized for the first time.&#39;&#39;
What caught my attention was Awara City&#39;s legend, ``The Demon Mask of the Wife-Odoshi&#39;&#39;.
The story is about a mother-in-law who can&#39;t remove her demon mask, but a kind-hearted wife keeps chanting nenbutsu to help her mother-in-law, without worrying about being surprised by the mask.
``Forget hatred and repay it with compassion and kindness. I felt the origins of the piety and kindness of the people of Fukui,&#39;&#39; said Muneta.
After getting the hint, Muneta started researching for his original picture book, including visiting Yoshizaki Gobo in Awara City soon after taking up his post, and completed the story ``Meo to Oni,&#39;&#39; which features a kind-hearted demon couple and a young boy.
Starting in June, he used his day job to paint 10 scenes in warm watercolors, and the materials for the picture book were ready.
Furthermore, the cover of the picture book will be made of washi paper, making use of Echizen Washi, a traditional craft that lives on in Echizen City.
This will provide an opportunity for parents and children to enjoy the feel of Japanese paper while reading aloud.
The donation goal is 850,000 yen to publish 600 copies.
The deadline is October 25th.
Muneta said, ``The spirit of Fukui, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, is something we can be proud of throughout the country.
&quot;Through picture books, I want to convey to children the true meaning of kindness and compassion that has been passed down from generation to generation.&quot;
Fukui Prefecture has certified 11 regional revitalization projects undertaken by cooperation groups and businesses within the prefecture, and this is one of the projects that will be supported using hometown tax donations.
The Fukui Shimbun is providing information, and the Fukui Bank is providing management support.

Ahead of consumption tax hike, last-minute rush of customers at retail stores in Okayama prefecture, special sales: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San-Digi
Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store where sales of large home appliances are strong before the tax increase
On the 28th, the last weekend before the consumption tax hike from 8% to 10%, families flocked to electronics stores and supermarkets in Okayama Prefecture to make last-minute purchases.
All stores are focusing on sales, with some hardware stores setting up special sales areas to encourage bulk purchases, and some suit stores selling winter clothing ahead of schedule.
Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store (Ekimae-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama City) is holding a sale with special prices for a limited time until the 30th.
A 37-year-old office worker from the city who came to the store in search of a refrigerator said, ``Even though it&#39;s 2%, when it comes to expensive items, you can&#39;t overlook the difference.&#39;&#39;
According to the store, sales of large home appliances such as TVs, washing machines, and refrigerators have increased since September, with sales about twice that of the previous year.
``The last-minute demand is more than we expected.In the second half of the year, it&#39;s noticeable that customers are looking for big-ticket items,&#39;&#39; said a person in charge.
Haruyama Shoji (Omotemachi), a suit sales company, is holding a sale called ``Big sale just before the tax increase&#39;&#39;.
The coats have been on sale since early September, one month earlier than usual, and sales this month are up 10% compared to last year.
A 19-year-old office worker from Asakuchi City who visited the Kurashiki store (Hakuraku-cho, Kurashiki City) to buy a suit to wear to his coming-of-age ceremony said, ``The ceremony is still a long way off, but I want to buy it before the tax increase.&#39;&#39;
With this tax increase, the tax rate on food and beverages will remain unchanged under the reduced tax rate system, so home centers and supermarkets will focus their appeal on daily necessities and alcohol.
Time Takaya store (Kanemoto, Naka-ku, Okayama City), a home improvement center, has a special corner near the entrance loaded with large quantities of detergent and tissues.
Sales of daily consumables have increased 1.6 times compared to the same month last year, and ``If we don&#39;t replenish them multiple times a day, we&#39;ll run out of them,&#39;&#39; said store manager Seiya Shimizu.
A 63-year-old civil servant from the same city visited the store and bought kitchen paper in bulk, saying, ``I&#39;m going to buy it anyway, so I took this opportunity.&#39;&#39;
Tenmaya Happy Town Okaminami store (Chikko Shinmachi, Minami-ku, Tokyo) will also set up wagons loaded with detergent, toilet paper, disposable diapers, etc. at the event hall.
A 35-year-old office worker from the same city said, ``If I get points back for cashless payments, the cost will be almost the same, so I won&#39;t have to rush to buy daily necessities.&#39;&#39;
2019 Best Manager Klopp: ``The best manager&#39;&#39; honoring his greatest enemy (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! News
Jurgen Klopp, who won the Best Manager award, reflected on his career in an interview and also commented on the current situation.
Among his many comments, one that surprised the public was about Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, his biggest rival for the Premier League title.
Neymar&#39;s best friend Alves says: ``His happiness is still at Barça...&#39;&#39;
Speaking after the Best award ceremony, the German coach said: ``I couldn&#39;t have imagined anything so great. I&#39;m very happy and proud to have won this award.&#39;&#39; It was a great few days for me. I was able to win this award thanks to my players. The most important thing is the team.&quot;
Regarding Guardiola, Klopp said: ``I have a lot of respect for him,&#39;&#39; and added: ``What can I say about him? He&#39;s won a lot of titles. The style in which his teams play is extraordinary.&#39;&#39; &quot;He&#39;s the best coach I&#39;ve ever played against, and it&#39;s an honor to be nominated and compete for the award with him.&quot;
He also mentioned manager Pochettino and Tottenham.
&quot;His last year was unbelievable. In most cases, you don&#39;t stay in people&#39;s memories unless you win the title. He built the team little by little and played in a great style.&quot;
Klopp had no hesitation in naming his best moment of 2019: ``(CL) The comeback against Barcelona. Many experts and myself wouldn&#39;t have bet an inch on us. A team with Messi and Suarez. Being 3-0 behind against them... it&#39;s like a death sentence. We had a small chance and we were able to take it. It was unbelievable. We may be able to say we won. This match will remain in everyone&#39;s memory.&quot;
Finally, when asked a more personal question, Klopp said: ``When we celebrated winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench and didn&#39;t even know where I was. That didn&#39;t happen this time. I don&#39;t like getting drunk because I&#39;m a person who suffers from an obsession with self-control.I celebrated winning the Champions League very modestly.I remember everything.If I had everyone lined up in front of me... &quot;If we do that, we might be able to tell all the people we saw from the bus,&quot; he concludes.

I want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, distribution of the new OS macOS Catalina will begin in October.
The exact date has not been disclosed, but it may be released on October 4th.
[See all images] macOS Catalina release date may be October 4th?
The image above was posted on Apple&#39;s website in Denmark (it has now been corrected).
The image does indeed have the words &quot;From October 4th (fraden 4. oktober)&quot; on it.
If it is an official website, the accuracy of the information seems to be high.
By the way, the feature I personally want to try most in macOS Catalina is &quot;Sidecar.&quot;
This is a function that treats the iPad as a sub-display of the Mac, a function that was previously achieved with a third-party app.
And since Sidecar is a genuine Apple feature, it is expected to be more complete (and responsive).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro equipped with a 16-inch display, but first I want to fully experience this next-generation macOS.
Sakura shrimp in the growing process photographed at a depth of 290 meters by Shizuoka City PT | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
Sakura shrimp born this year successfully photographed in the deep sea of Suruga Bay on the 11th, off the coast of Kambara, Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City (Courtesy of Yui Sakura Shrimp Project)
The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, organized by the Marine Industry Cluster Council, an industry-academia-government collaboration including Shizuoka City, has recently succeeded in photographing cherry shrimp, which are believed to have been born during this year&#39;s spring/summer spawning season on the 290-meter-deep ocean floor of Suruga Bay.
The footage of the growth process is valuable, and officials hope it will help elucidate the mysteries of Sakura shrimp&#39;s ecology.
The photo was taken near the ocean floor about 1.5 kilometers offshore from the Kambara area of Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City.
A total of about 300 fish were confirmed in 17 minutes.
The previous knowledge that Sakura shrimp, which live in the deep sea during the day, ``form a certain degree of swarm on the ocean floor,&#39;&#39; has been confirmed once again.
Adults are about 40 mm long, and the individual in the photo was about 23 mm long.
The spawning season was determined by comparing it with seasonal data on landed Sakura shrimp.
Detailed analysis will be requested from Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Industrial Technology College, which are part of the team.
Keisuke Mizuno, the project leader, says, ``We want to capture the live appearance of shrimp as they grow, including young shrimp.&#39;&#39;

[First half of the Bud Olympics race] World champion Kento Momota and Chou Tienchen, who is in good shape, are one step ahead!
&lt;Men&#39;s Singles&gt; (Bado x Spi!
The Japanese representative won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland, Basel), a big badminton event held in August. After completing a training camp in early September, they will be competing at the China OP (starting on the 17th). Participated in Changzhou/Super1000).
Here, we look back at the first half of the Olympic race from May to August, when the race to qualify for next year&#39;s Tokyo Olympics began, and look ahead to the men&#39;s singles as we move towards the mid-game (September to December). /Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
The badminton Olympic race started in May, and by the time the world championships were over, four top tournaments (Super 500 and above) in which top players competed had been completed.
The two players who maintained good form in the first half were Kento Momota, who won two of the four tournaments, and Taiwan&#39;s Chou Tien-chen.
Momota won the World Championship, and Chou Tien-chen won the Indonesia OP (S1000), tournaments where you can earn a high number of &quot;world ranking points&quot; that are directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also won the Japan OP (S750).
The four tournaments I have been participating in since May are the team competition Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/top 16), Japan OP (July), and World Championship (August).
Although his numbers are small compared to other top athletes, his schedule puts less strain on his body.
Since there was only one World Championship tournament in August, the fatigue was probably not as great as when competing in consecutive races.
Good results are required in the mid-way games, which include consecutive top-level tournaments starting in September.
Taiwanese ace who is strong in consecutive matches.
Pay attention to young Thai people!
Chou Tien-chen, who also won the top tournaments Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
He also participated in his hometown Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September and won the race.
He is physically strong to begin with, and is not bothered by consecutive matches.
Even if the tournament continues, there will be no major problems with match performance.
In fact, by getting high points in the first half, it probably became easier to adjust the schedule for future tournaments.
Until last year, Chou Tien-chen gave the impression that he lacked explosive power, but since the beginning of this year, he has become more consistent in his play and has been able to continue to show good results.
For Momota, who is ranked No. 1 in the world, this will likely be an even more difficult opponent than before.
Other than these two players, other players who achieved results in the first half were Thailand&#39;s young ace Kantaphon and India&#39;s B. Sai Praneeth.
And Anders Antonsen, who is struggling alone as a European player.
Although Kantaphon has not advanced to the finals in any of the top tournaments, he has been able to finish in the top four in two tournaments this season, and is gaining the ability to win and advance to the top.
Although he still has some rough edges, the 20-year-old (he turned 21 on the 18th) is now able to rally on an equal footing with the top athletes, and it can be said that he has great potential to make a big leap forward in the Olympic race.
Also, Sai Praneeth B. has taken a step forward among India&#39;s lineup of good singles players.
Sameer Verma, Prannoy HS., and Srikanth Kidambi, who has fallen behind due to injury, will catch up in the future, so we need to be careful about the Indian players from the mid-game onwards.
New mobile phone charges: Lower prices through fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Edition
Mobile phone companies have released new rate plans in line with the enforcement of the revised Telecommunications Business Law in October.
However, it generally remained high.
Last summer, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, ``There is room to lower prices by about 40%,&#39;&#39; and despite heightened expectations for price cuts, no price competition occurred.
A major factor is that Rakuten&#39;s full-scale entry into the market has been postponed, and the oligopoly of the three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to have a fee structure that is easy to use through fair competition.
I would like to see more efforts from mobile phone companies.
The revised law prohibits bundled discounts on device charges and communication charges.
This is because, in exchange for selling devices at a lower price, communication charges were set to be higher.
Softbank and KDDI (au) have announced plans that will make devices up to half the price.
However, both companies have a ``SIM lock&#39;&#39; on their devices that prevents them from using other companies&#39; lines for 100 days.
NTT Docomo will cut device fees by up to one-third only for subscribers of its own lines.
It appears that all three companies are continuing to &quot;lock in&quot; customers to prevent them from switching to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has announced a policy that requires immediate release of SIM locks.
Companies also need to respond quickly.
Rakuten&#39;s postponement was due to the construction of base stations and other communications networks not proceeding as planned.
This was a disappointment, as it was expected to be a catalyst for price competition.
Perhaps the outlook was naive.
The start date and price of full-scale service have not been disclosed.
As a company that is responsible for social infrastructure, I would like the company to engage in its business responsibly.
The latest fee revision was prompted by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga&#39;s remarks.
Mr. Suga expressed his dissatisfaction with the three companies&#39; new rates, saying, ``I think competition will start from now on.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s okay to leave things as they are.&#39;&#39;
However, I don&#39;t think that ``official price cuts&#39;&#39; distort the market and encourage healthy competition.
Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before the government dictates to them.
Each company&#39;s fee structure is very complex and comparisons are not easy.
The Consumer Affairs Agency has warned that even though devices are advertised as being ``up to half price,&#39;&#39; there are cases where consumers end up paying more than half the price.
Companies themselves must try to provide thorough and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misunderstandings among users.
Withdrawal limit lowered to 500,000 yen for cash cards of three Shinkin banks in Mie Prefecture - Ise Shimbun

[Rugby World Cup] Instant sending off and scuffle. American player&#39;s &quot;face-threatening tackle&quot; causes ripples overseas as &quot;insulting and despicable play&quot; (THE ANSWER) - Yahoo! News
US FL player Quill plays rough play, former England player: ``It can&#39;t be called a tackle&#39;&#39;
At the Rugby World Cup in Japan on the 26th, the United States, the last of the 20 participating nations, was completely defeated by England 7-45.
Although it started with a loss, the rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half is causing a stir.
He was sent off for a shoulder tackle to the opponent&#39;s face.
The actual scene was also released by overseas media along with a video, with a former England player complaining that it was ``an insulting and despicable play&#39;&#39; and ``it can&#39;t even be called a tackle.&#39;&#39;
[Video] “Insulting and despicable play” causes ripples overseas!
A red card, players from both sides get into a commotion...The actual moment of the ``face-threatening tackle&#39;&#39; performed by Quill from the U.S. national team
His passionate fighting spirit has crossed the line.
It was the 29th minute of the second half with the score at 0-38.
Deep in the enemy half, England captain Farrell lost his balance slightly while catching a pass from a teammate.
Quill was the one who went to tackle this.
However, he raised his upper body, not from the waist down, and violently collided with his upper body.
As a result, the opponent&#39;s heads come into contact, resulting in a headbutt.
Farrell was sent flying hard and fell to the ground.
England players violently protested the clearly unjustified play, trying to push Quill.
Players from both sides quickly gathered together, creating a tense atmosphere.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill was given a red card and immediately sent off.
He left the pitch looking embarrassed, but some boos were heard from the audience who wanted fair play.
Stuff, a local media outlet in New Zealand, a rugby powerhouse, featured the headline ``Rugby World Cup 2019: US player sent off for sleazy play, England cruise to victory.&#39;&#39;
``Kill was sent off for a nasty shoulder charge to England star Farrell&#39;s face,&#39;&#39; the report said. ``A scuffle ensued, mostly involving players from both sides.&#39;&#39;
The article features comments from former England player and commentator Hugo Monya.
&quot;It&#39;s insulting and despicable. It can&#39;t even be called a tackle. It&#39;s a despicable play,&quot; he said.
With one player missing, the USA managed to escape a shutout with a try in the 81st minute.
However, Quill&#39;s play left a bad taste in his mouth.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals out of 1,455 public hospitals such as Japan Red Cross and other public hospitals nationwide that were deemed to have ``poor medical performance.&#39;&#39;
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has verified the treatment performance of 14 public hospitals: National Hospital Organization Awara Hospital in Awara City, Sakai City Mikuni Hospital, Oda Hospital in Echizen Town, and Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town. Four facilities were targeted.
⇒4 hospitals subject to reorganization “Standards are strange”
The government decided to take this unprecedented step, citing the need to encourage hospitals in competing regions to reorganize and integrate in order to curb medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging of the population.
The plan is to request targeted hospitals to seriously consider reorganization and consolidation in October, with a conclusion to be reached by September next year.
Although there is no compulsion, local leaders and residents are expected to oppose the move, fearing that there will be no nearby hospital.
It was announced at a meeting on the same day.
Targeted hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, and many were hospitals with relatively few beds.
By prefecture, the highest percentages were Niigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%), and Okayama (43.3%). Ta.
Hokkaido had the highest number of targets at 54, while Okinawa was the only one with zero targets.
Based on data from 2017, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare surveyed 1,455 public and public hospitals that can handle the ``highly acute phase&#39;&#39; for critically ill patients and the ``acute phase&#39;&#39; for general surgery.
The necessity of publicizing the hospital&#39;s name was determined by analyzing medical treatment performance in nine categories, such as cancer and emergency care, and whether a competing hospital was within a 20-minute drive.
Targeted hospitals will be asked to consider measures such as abolishing their services or moving some departments to other hospitals.
Medical costs will skyrocket in 2025, when all baby boomers will reach the age of 75 or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal of reducing the number of hospital beds nationwide from 1,246,000 (2018) to 1,191,000.
Currently, there are many beds for the ``highly acute phase&#39;&#39; and ``acute phase,&#39;&#39; which require a generous staffing of nurses and medical costs, but there is a shortage of beds for rehabilitation, which is highly needed by the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to simply reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
Regarding the reorganization and consolidation of hospitals, each prefecture is formulating a ``regional medical care initiative&#39;&#39; that determines the number of beds needed in 2025.
The country has been divided into 339 regions, and local governments and medical professionals are discussing the matter, but many local residents and leaders remain cautious, and discussions have stalled.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare hopes to stimulate discussion by publishing the names of hospitals with poor performance.
Hypothesizing Komagatake eruption, Hokkaido and other areas conduct comprehensive disaster prevention training for the first time in 18 years with resident participation (Video): Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition
A comprehensive disaster prevention drill hypothesizing the eruption of Mt. Komagatake (1,131 meters) was held on September 27th in the towns of Mori, Nanae, and Shikabe in the Oshima jurisdiction.
Approximately 400 people, including residents and employees of 20 organizations including the prefecture and three towns, participated.
This was the first such event since the Hokkaido Komagatake Volcanic Disaster Prevention Council formulated an evacuation plan that included evacuation routes for residents in August.
This is the first time in 18 years that a wide-area training exercise involving local residents has been held.
It is assumed that Komagatake erupted at 8:45 a.m., and a mudflow reached the town at the foot of the mountain.
When the eruption alert level was raised to level 5 (evacuation), evacuation shelters were opened in Mori and Nanae towns, and residents were transported using buses prepared by each town and prefectural police vehicles.
100,000 students attend Vancouver climate demonstration, canceling school to appeal for global warming measures (Minna no Keizai Shimbun Network) - Yahoo! News
Approximately 100,000 citizens, mostly students, who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, marched in Vancouver on September 27 to call for climate change countermeasures.
Climate demonstration in Vancouver
The march started at Vancouver City Hall, crossed Cambie Bridge, and ended at the downtown library.
People holding placards began to gather in front of the city hall, the meeting point, several hours before the start, and by the time the event started at 1:00 p.m., the number of people had grown to fill several blocks of road in front of the city hall.
The number of participants continued to increase after that, and eventually over 100,000 people participated.
Police also cooperated by regulating the roads along the way, and watched for several hours until everyone had finished walking.
To coincide with the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York, a number of events to think about global warming have been held in Vancouver since last weekend.
On the final day, the 27th, a school strike was held as ``Fridays for Future.&#39;&#39;
The students who took time off from school to participate on this day appealed to adults, saying, ``I want to protect the earth even if it means taking time off from something as important as school.&#39;&#39; Many adults who took time off from work to participate also said, ``I want to seriously study and think about it.&#39;&#39; We will also do our best for the future of our children.&#39;&#39;
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends 9 prefectures for swine fever vaccine (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a draft amendment to the epidemic prevention guidelines that would allow preventive vaccination of domestic pigs, which is currently not permitted, in order to prevent the spread of the livestock infectious disease &quot;swine fever.&quot; did.
The plan is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi prefectures, where infections have been confirmed in pigs and wild boars.
The movement of live vaccinated pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted within the area, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the area is permitted.
The aim is to complete the process as early as October, after receiving public comments from the general public.
By using vaccines and allowing the distribution of meat and other products outside the region, Japan will no longer be a &quot;free country&quot; as certified by international organizations, which could have an impact on pork exports.
Since the outbreak last September, Japan&#39;s status as a free country has been temporarily suspended.
In the revised bill, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has established ``areas where vaccination is recommended&#39;&#39; based on expert opinion for areas where there is a high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
Target prefectures create a ``vaccination program&#39;&#39; that outlines the scope of vaccination, timing, number of animals, and how to proceed, and after approval from the ministry, use is permitted at the discretion of the governor.
The other seven prefectures recommended for vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
Regions will be determined once the guidelines are revised and the situation will be assessed.
In principle, the movement of vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses, excrement, etc. will be restricted within the area.
Meat and processed products are not targeted due to the cost of restricting distribution and the impact on farmers, and in effect, distribution outside the area is allowed.
Thoroughly dispose of food waste to prevent the spread of the virus.
They will appeal to the safety of vaccinated pigs and work to prevent harmful rumors.
The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Epidemic Prevention Task Force.
From now on, the government will hold opinion inquiries and public comments from prefectures until October 7th, and the new epidemic prevention guidelines will be implemented.
Independent Keisuke Honda makes an open approach to Man U!
&quot;Please make me an offer. I don&#39;t need money&quot; (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
Delivered on 9/28 (Sat) 2:57
Former Japan national team midfielder Keisuke Honda, who left Australia&#39;s A-League side Melbourne Victory at the end of last season and is currently an independent midfielder, has taken a surprising action.
[Video] Was Keisuke Honda actually in the match?
The shocking truth is revealed
Honda updated his Twitter account late at night on the 27th, Japan time, and said, ``Please make me an offer. I don&#39;t need money, but I need to play with a great team and great teammates.&#39;&#39; He made a public approach to a club. It was.
The person to whom he sent the &quot;counter offer&quot; was Manchester United, a world-famous club.
Why did Honda make such a grand request to one of the most powerful clubs in the Premier League?
The trigger lies in an article published on the Australian version of FOX Sports on the 24th.
The article, titled ``5 forwards Manchester United could sign amid injury crisis,&#39;&#39; lists five free agents who are currently available for signing.
Honda&#39;s name was also mentioned among players such as Hatem Ben Arfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfried Bony.
United are currently in a state of emergency due to a number of injuries to midfielder Paul Pogba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, forward Anthony Martial, and forward Marcus Rashford.
The Red Devils, led by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, have had a difficult start to the league with just two wins and 22 losses, and are facing issues with the quality of their front line.
Therefore, the Australian media named Honda as a new candidate to strengthen the team.
The article states, ``Honda&#39;s signing as a creative wing player, not strictly a striker, could fill the void left by Andreas Pereira.&#39;&#39;
It said his nine goals in 18 games for Melbourne Victory was a &quot;solid record&quot;, but it was also noted that &quot;Honda, 33, needs to step away from his pastime of managing the Cambodian national team and command full attention&quot;.
Will Honda&#39;s approach bear fruit?
It will be interesting to see if United make a move for the veteran, who has declared his goal to participate in next year&#39;s Tokyo Olympics.
Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce completes installation of 500 portable translation devices, lending them free of charge to stores, etc. | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
PockeTalk, a portable translation device lent free of charge to 500 locations including stores in Hamamatsu City
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on the 26th that it has completed the installation of a total of 500 portable translation devices, ``PokeTalk,&#39;&#39; at stores and other locations in Hamamatsu City, in a project that lends portable translation devices, ``PokeTalk,&#39;&#39; free of charge to member businesses.
This is said to be the first time in the country that the translation machines have been deployed intensively in the same area, and attention will be focused on whether this will lead to improved ability to respond to inbound tourists.
The lending locations include 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
The city&#39;s Naka Ward accounts for 60%.
We have also begun displaying lending locations on the map app Google Maps, allowing you to locate ``stores with foreign language support&#39;&#39; on your smartphone.
It can be accessed from the Lake Hamana Tourism Area website.
The free lending of PokeTalk, which is available in 74 languages, was started in April in response to the declaration by nine organizations in the city that Hamamatsu is ``Japan&#39;s number one inbound tourism support city.&#39;&#39;
The Chamber of Commerce will purchase 500 units and lend them for two years to small and medium-sized businesses that meet conditions such as obtaining hospitality certification and implementing cashless payments.
A representative from the Chamber of Commerce said, ``We hope this will lead to the development of new foreign customers amidst the difficult business environment.&#39;&#39;
Does Tomoyo Ikemura, now a master of the straight drive, not need to tee up for the first shot?
Today&#39;s caddy&#39;s best shot
A 1W shot is not necessarily hit from a tee up.
When you want to gain distance, such as on the second shot of a par-5, there is also a technique known as the &quot;straight drive&quot; where you hit the ball on the ground.
The recent 1W has a large head volume and comes with the risk of the ball scattering, but there are players who frequently practice this on the teeing ground.
Hiroyo Ikemura is looking forward to his first victory on tour.
The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a pro, is small at 166cm tall, but currently ranks 7th in driving distance (average of 304.02 yards).
While he is good at long shots, one of his issues was the accuracy of his fairway wood.
In early spring, he was enlightened and said, ``Since the spoon (3W) shot wasn&#39;t working, I thought I&#39;d try the straight drive shot.&#39;&#39;
From the practice round, he sometimes drops the ball onto the grass in the teeing area and casually swings off a 1W.
He often uses the tee up when a big carry is required, but he also makes effective use of the straight drive on holes where both sides are narrow.
``It can be used on holes where the line of sight is downhill.&#39;&#39;
The trajectory measurement device recorded a carry of 270 to 280 yards.
``That&#39;s why you don&#39;t need a 3W.The caddy also says that a straight drive is safer than a 3W...&#39;&#39;.
Since the Japan Tour Championship in June, the only wood in my caddy bag is the 1W.
The second longest club is the UT with a loft of 17 degrees.
His tactics surprised even his fellow tour mates, and the audience who witnessed them were also happy to hear the voices of admiration.
The trick is to swing the club level.
&quot;Whether you hit it with a down blow or an upper, it won&#39;t fly straight. If it&#39;s a cut trajectory, it will go to the right. Originally, I used a straight drive to correct the swing of a 1W shot (when teeing up). As you practice, your attack angle (the angle of incidence of the club) will become more gradual.
Although there is a risk of not being able to catch the ball and slicing it, ``That&#39;s why I can erase the left side (it doesn&#39;t curve to the left)&#39;&#39;.
It&#39;s easy to say, but it&#39;s a professional technique that will make you groan.

GQ MEN&#39;s 10-day mix and match - Day 9 &quot;Skateboarding with friends&quot; (GQ JAPAN) - Yahoo! News
My only means of transportation is skateboarding!
I started skating when a friend invited me, and I&#39;ve been hooked ever since.
I&#39;m still a beginner, but it feels good to push along the asphalt.
Filson&#39;s hunting jacket is convenient because you can put your smartphone, wallet, and other luggage in it, allowing you to be hands-free.
With shorts, you can feel the wind directly and it feels good.
Keep your feet light with Converse skateboard shoes.
The fashion and culture surrounding skateboarding is also cool, so I check magazines and Instagram frequently!
I also started going to a salon in Yutenji run by a skater hairdresser for my haircuts.
I&#39;m inspired by the fact that I&#39;ve been taught tricks that I can&#39;t do yet, information about skateboard parks, and all sorts of other things.
After school, our daily routine is to stroll around town with our friends on our skateboards.

Akutagawa&#39;s handwritten manuscript before his suicide will be exhibited for the first time Literary theory of weakness and tragedy | Shizuoka Shimbun At-S
Ryunosuke Akutagawa&#39;s handwritten manuscript to be exhibited for the first time at the Tabata Writers&#39; Village Memorial Museum
Author Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) published the essay &quot;Sequel to Literary, Too Literary,&quot; which he published in his final years after a literary debate with Junichiro Tanizaki, and was sent to a writer named Tabata in Kita Ward, Tokyo.

It will be on display at the museum from October 1st.
Although the existence of his essays was known, including in his complete collection, this is the first time that his handwritten manuscript has been exhibited to the public.
It is believed that Akutagawa wrote this several months before he committed suicide, and Jo Tanei, a researcher at the museum, said, ``It shows how Akutagawa, who was weakened both physically and mentally, earnestly faced literary challenges with tragic determination.&#39;&#39; .
The 12-page essay, each containing 200 characters, was published in the April 2017 issue of Bungei Shunju.
Greta Thunberg wonders on Twitter: ``Why do adults mock and threaten children?&#39;&#39;
Greta Thunberg, a Swedish environmental activist, gave a speech on September 23rd at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.
While her speech has garnered attention, messages insulting Greta have also emerged.
[Tweets] Greta Thunberg: &quot;Why do adults mock and threaten children?&quot;
A political commentator said on an American TV show about Greta, ``She is mentally ill. She is being exploited by her parents and the international left,&#39;&#39; and the TV station that featured her has apologized.
In Japan, there are many comments online that comment on things that are not Greta&#39;s own words, such as ``I feel sorry for her because she is being used&#39;&#39; and ``She should go to school.&#39;&#39;
Meanwhile, on September 26th, Greta posted on her Twitter, ``Why do adults spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children?&#39;&#39;
“They come up with every lie and conspiracy theory they can think of.”
Greta said, ``Here we go again. As you have noticed, my haters are as active as ever, chasing me about my appearance, my clothes, my attitude, and what makes me different.&#39;&#39; &quot;They come up with every lie and conspiracy theory they can think of,&quot; the post began.
He went on to point out that adults seem to be shifting the focus of the discussion because they don&#39;t want to face the climate and environmental crisis.
I honestly don&#39;t understand why adults would spend their time mocking and threatening teenagers and children.
I could have done something better with that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don&#39;t waste your time paying any more attention to them.
The world is starting to wake up.
Change is coming.
Whether adults like the change or not.
See you on the streets on Friday!
Last Friday, the 20th, climate change strikes were held in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta called for the event to be held again on Friday the 27th.

Garcia&#39;s wedge shot
I was able to make some progress in the first half, so I thought I would be able to continue with that momentum in the second half, but my putter didn&#39;t work very well and I wasn&#39;t able to make any progress, so that was frustrating.
-Did you see victory with the eagle on the 6th and birdie on the 7th?
Even after hitting the bogey on the 4th hole, there were still 5 pars left, so I was trying to get back on track, and a chip-in eagle came on the 6th hole.
I got a birdie on the 7th hole, which gave me a chance, but I was disappointed that I couldn&#39;t improve in the second half.
-What did you learn from this tournament?
I haven&#39;t been feeling well lately (with my shots), so it was good that I was able to hold the fairway well even on a course with narrow fairways.
It was a course where the rough was different from normal to bad, and the way you hit and distance changed, so I didn&#39;t have much experience with it, so I learned a lot.
- How is it different from regular tournaments?
I mean places where it was possible to take pictures with a camera (such as a smartphone).
It didn&#39;t bother me at all, but there were quite a few people in the gallery taking videos.
Other than that, there wasn&#39;t much that had changed, but since it was a co-sponsored tournament with few Japanese players, I went into the match with the mindset that I wouldn&#39;t lose to the overseas players.
The second half will start, but I can&#39;t aim for the top prize if I don&#39;t win one or more, so I want to get one more win, and the ZOZO Championship is coming up soon, so I can qualify for the tournament by finishing high in the tournaments up to that point. I will do my best.
How can I prevent dementia and keep it at a level of &quot;forgetfulness&quot;?
Interview and text by Yo Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have attempted to research and develop a drug for dementia, but have failed.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is becoming clearer, and it has become clear that it is possible to keep the symptoms to an extremely mild level, to the extent of forgetfulness.
We spoke to Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of Kinki University Hospital Stroke Center.
Dementia will not go away
― ― Drugs to prevent or treat dementia are long-awaited, but what is the current status?
Otsuki: Anyone can develop dementia as they age, with varying degrees of severity, from mild to severe.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years for a new dementia drug to be developed.
The drug donepezil, which is commonly used in Japan, is already not covered by insurance in some countries overseas, so it cannot be expected to have a significant cure.
On the other hand, people are now able to live longer lives as deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and deaths from cancer are also decreasing due to remarkable advances in treatments such as anti-cancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
It is not something that can be solved by the individual and their family alone; society as a whole needs to create an environment where people can live safely in the community.
How to keep it to a level of “forgetfulness”
― ― Are there people who are more likely to develop dementia or those who are less likely to get it?
Otsuki: Even if dementia is unavoidable, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep the symptoms to a level of ``forgetfulness.&#39;&#39;
Dementia is considered a lifestyle-related disease, and there are certain people who are more susceptible to it.
First, people with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop dementia.
Dementia is considered a lifestyle-related disease.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.
The presence or absence of economic power also plays a role.
For example, in some parts of the United States, food stamps are distributed to the poor.The food stamps can be used to store frozen hamburgers, pizza, and chicken.
It can be used by people who live in environments where they cannot cook in the first place because they do not have access to gas or electricity.
This results in a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, leading to a lifestyle that is biased towards fat and carbohydrates.
Eventually, they become poor but obese, and all they have to do is watch TV, leaving them physically disabled.
A similar situation could exist in Japan.
Additionally, people who don&#39;t think well or don&#39;t work are also more likely to develop dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to avoid getting metabolic syndrome, read books on a daily basis, and think about things.

Jaguar F-PACE undergoes first major improvement...possibility of hybridization (Response) - Yahoo! News
An improved prototype of Jaguar&#39;s first crossover SUV, the F-PACE, has been caught on camera for the first time in southern Europe.
The F-PACE originates from the C-X17, a four-seater concept SUV that was first unveiled in 2013.
A 5-seater version was then released in 2014, and it officially debuted as the F-PACE at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show.
The first and current model was released the following year in 2016, and this is the first facelift.
The captured prototype is covered in thick camouflage, but some of the new design can be seen.
The headlights have been designed to be more compact and thinner, and the side air intakes have also been revised to a sportier oval shape.
The grille is completely disguised, but we&#39;re sure it will be redesigned.
At the rear end, part of the new taillights can be seen, with elongated reverse lights at the top.
It seems possible that the design of the current model, which wraps around to the sides a lot, has been revised to be more compact.
The cabin is expected to feature the company&#39;s Pivi Pro touchscreen infotainment system, as well as a new digital cluster, HVAC control screen, refreshed steering wheel, and gear selector.
The powertrain options are expected to include a 2.0-liter inline 4-cylinder turbo diesel engine and a hybrid 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder Ingenium.
The world premiere is likely to take place within 2020.
