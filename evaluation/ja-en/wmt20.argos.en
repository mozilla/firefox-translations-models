Driving in high heels is dangerous!
There are many accidents in the pedal of young people. Yahoo! News
Violations that violate road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem with older drivers, though the news of accidents caused by mistakes such as pedal stepping mistakes is increasing.
In the number of accidents caused by pedal treading in the age of 24 years old, the number of cases in which the police department data in 2015 exceeded 1032 of the age of 75.
It is important to call attention in the same way as the young people, not the mistakes in the elderly.
Do you take aシャray on your feet?
Is it safe?
There is no description of gender ratio or cause in this data, but unlike the elderly who are often thought to come from the deterioration of the body such as driving skills and reflective nerves, there are also mistakes that you may be aware of other things such as music and conversation in the youth layer, and a stepping mistake caused by clothes.
In particular, some women choose high heels,プs, sandals, mules, and clothing for the day and drive as they are.
Some people think that it is not suitable for driving, but it is troublesome to wear. However, there are many people who do not think about the possibility that it will lead to danger at all, and there are people who are driving without worry.
However, driving in high heels and rivers conflicts with road traffic laws.
Article 70 "Safety Driving Obligation Violation" stipulated as "Reliably operate handles, brakes, and other operations", "Do not drive accidents and harm people."

There is one sentence.
Each prefecture is considered to be a violation of the operation of the footwear that may interfere with the operation even if it is not specified as high heel.
Why is driving in high heels dangerous?
It is clear if you think about the basics of pedal operation safely.
For safe pedal operation, first place the foot heel on the floor, put the foot vertically against the brake pedal, and tilt the foot to the right when stepping on theセルel pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep it firmly so that the heel does not shine regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the heel is small, and the heel is always bleeding with the grass, and the heel height has an angle to the entire leg, so the area of the foot that grounds the pedal is small, and it is difficult to adjust finely.
This is considered to be dangerous.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to ペダル high heel heel heel heel, and heel can not be ペダルped when it is a sudden brake, or the heel is pulled off and the heel is pulled off.
In addition, there is a case where heel pulls behind the pedal and theセルelerator pedal disappears.

"Beauty and Ugly" is a paper weight?
What is the image of "Hobi" overlapping with the beautiful girl of the work of Kazuo Ume (Magics ) - Yahoo! News
What is mys  beauty and my dow?
From the 1950s, many works were sent out to the world, and as the first person of "Fear Manga", "Kazuo Ume, Beautiful Girl Collection" (GENKOSHA), which is introduced focusing on the beautiful girl painted by Kazuo Ume, was released in August 2019.
If you are using it, you will be aware of the correlation between "beauty" and "horror" of the work.
[Image ] Is it attractive because there is a 「dow?
Beautiful girl of the work of Kazuo Ume (five pieces)
In the beginning of the “Beautiful Girl Collection”, there was a statement that “beauty of fear, uglyness, the shocking scene and deployment of the story can stand out only because of the beauty of her polarity”, but because there is a contrast such as the beautiful face distortion and the expression of the grief. ...
There is a keyword called "snake" in the thing that appeared many in the works of Kazuo Umezu, but snakes are らed as "innocent物atures" by the person who sees, and people who feel "innocent" are various.
There are people who like虫tiles in the world, and some people are suffering.
Thus, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beauty" and "ugly evil" may be the "serpent" of the生きature in the front.
In addition, this物ature is worshipped as a生きature that is more spiritual than ancient times, and the house where "white snake" lived is said to have a good edge.
There is a series of “Habi ” and “Still Girl” in 。.
It is a market to be a beautiful woman with a dow.
If you say it is imadoki, it should be said that it is a "cool beauty" type ... ... It seems like the common point of the beautiful girl who appeared in the Umeji work.
Orochi, the main role of “Orochi”, which was serialized in “Weekly Shonen Sunday” from69, is a beautiful girl character that is considered the representative of Umeji’s work, but it reminds me of “serpent” somewhere such as making a deep sleep every 100 years to keep e。 life and e。 youth.

【First half of the Bado Olympics】World champion, Kento MOMOTA, and Shutennari favored one step!
<Men's Singles> (Bad x Spie)
Japan won six medals at the 25th World Championship (S、zerland), the big event of badminton held in August.
In this section, we will look back on the first half of the race from May to August, where the Olympics will be held next year. Badminton Magazine Editorial Department
The 5th Badminton Olympics race was held at the time of the World Championship, and the top players competed in the tournament (Super500 or higher) were digested.
The first half of the game was Kento Momoda, who won the 2nd prize during the game, and Kensei Suoten, Taiwan.
MOMOTA wins the World Championship, Suotenari, Indonesia OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympics.
MOMOTA also has Japan OP (S750).
The 5th tournament will be held in Sudirman Cup (May/China), Indonesia OP (July/Result is 16), Japan OP (July ), World Championship (August).
Although the number is limited compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
In August, only one tournament of the world championships will not cause fatigue.
High-ranking competitions from September are expected to be a good result.
Taiwan’s戦 is strong against the war.
Japanese
At the same time, Suotennari won the top tournament of Indonesia OP and Thailand OP (S500).
I participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the championship.
A player who is not suffering from the fight because the physical is strong.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the upcoming tournament by winning high points in the first half.
天ing last year, I felt that I was lacking in力 force. However, I felt stable in the play surface this year, so I could continue my favor.
For Momoda, the world ranking number one, it seems to be more comfortable than ever before.
In addition to this two players, the result was left in the first half of the game, Thailand’s young  Cantafon and India’s Sai Planetyz B.
Anders Antonsen, who struggles as an European force, is the three players.
Cantafone is not a top tournament, but it has the power to win the top, such as entering the best 4 in this season.
Even though there is still a rough face, it is 20 years old that can rally with top players. On the 18th, the 21st year old) is likely to have a lot of potential to leap in the Olympic race.
In addition, Sai Praスs B. has stepped out in India where singles have a good player.
Samil Barama, Prano H.S., and Slikans Kydambi, who is late in Kega, will be in the future, but it is necessary to pay attention to India after midfield war.
New Price of Mobile: Low Price in Fair Competition: Hokkaido Newspaper
The new price plan of the mobile phone company has been released due to the amended Telecommunications Business Act in October.
However, it became high.
Mr. Yoshihiro Sugi said, "There is a room to lower about 4 percent in the last summer," and the price competition did not occur even though the expectation to lower the price was high.
It is a big factor that the full-fledged entry of ten will be forward and the state of widow for three major companies.
It is desirable to be a cost system that is easy to use by fair competition for consumers.
I would like to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment law pro ts set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal price, the communication fee was set to be expensive.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced a plan to make the terminal up to half price.
However, it is a mechanism that "SIM lock" can not be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT コモOMO makes the terminal fee up to one third for its own line contractors.
It is reflected to continue "enclosed" to prevent transfers to third parties.
Regarding SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications expressed an obligation to immediately cancel.
It is necessary to respond quickly to the business side.
The postponement of ten was because the maintenance of communication networks such as base stations did not proceed as planned.
It is a good feeling that I put on the shoulder just as I expected to be an explosion of price reduction competition.
It was the sweetness of the甘.
The start time and price of full-scale service are not clear.
We want to be a company responsible for social infrastructure.
This price revision was triggered by Mr. Suga Secretary General.
Mr. Suga’s new price for three companies, “I think the competition will start from now on.” I was dissatisfied, "I have no idea what to do.
However, it seems to be a healthy competition because of the market.
Businesses should develop customer-focused competition before they are out of the government.
The rate system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency calls attention as there is a case where the consumer’s burden exceeds half price even though the terminal is advertising such as “up to half price”.
In order to avoid misunderstandings of users, the company must be careful and understandable.

【Rugby W Cup】A場 & Brawl Overseas baptism "In t and inferior play" ( THE ANSWER ) - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL kuil is a rough play, former England representative, “It is not a thing that can be called “Tackle”.
Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan Tournament was completed on 26th, and the United States in 20 countries lost 7-45 in England.
The rough play that FL John Kyle built in the second half is called Ripple.
A place where the shoulder tuckle is placed on the face of the opponent.
The actual scene is also released with video, and former England representatives are suffering from saying, “In。t and inferior play” and “It is not a thing that can be called “Tackle”.
[Video ] "In t and inferior play" and overseas 紋s!
One place to leave, two army players enter into the dying...The real moment of the "facial danger tackle" built by the US representative Quill
Hot fighters crossed the line.
It is the second half of 29 minutes.
Faler of England’s flagship, deep in the enemy team, had a slight balance when catching the ally path.
This was a quill.
However, he caused the upper body rather than lower from the waist, and he つけed the body with the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the other party are in contact with the head.
Farrell was blown away and fell.
Obviously, England tries to push the quills to play lacking justity.
Both army players gather at once, and they became airy.
As a result of TMO (video judgement), the kuil is re。ed with a red card.
I left the pitch with a bad face, but some people asked for fair play.
Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave the game and England wins.
“Kill had a negative shoulder charge on the face of England Star’s Farrell, and it was re場ed.” “It was almost a struggle with both army.”
In the article, I introduced a comment by former England representative and commented by Commentator Ugo Moña.
"In。t and inferior. It is not called "Tackle". It is a subtle play.
The U.S. whose match is missing is 81 minutes, and the U.S. who missed the final race.
However, the play of the kuil left behind the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the name of 424 hospitals that the number of public hospitals such as public hospitals in 1455 and Japan-red would be poor medical records.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare examined the results of the treatment of 14 public hospitals ▽ Awara Hospital ▽ Mikuni Hospital in Sakai City ▽ Oda Hospital in Echizen Town ▽ Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town
⇒ 4 hospitals to be re編ed "のonential"
In order to reduce the medical expenses caused by aging, we had to re編e and integrate with hospitals in the competing area.
In October, I would like to ask the hospital for a full-fledged review of re編ation and integration and make a conclusion by September next year.
There is no compulsory force, but it is expected that the local chief and the rebellion of the residents is caused by anxiety that there is no familiar hospital.
The meeting of the same day was announced.
The number of beds was relatively small.
In the order of Niigata(53・7 % ), Hokkaido(48・6 % ), Miyagi(47・5 % ), Yamaguchi(46・7 % ), Okayama(43・3 % ) was higher.
The number of targets is the largest of 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was the only zero.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare surveyed 1455 hospitals that can correspond to "high acute period" for severe patients and "acute period" for general surgery based on data for FY2017.
We analyzed the need for publicization of the hospital name byを分析しing 9 medical records such as cancer and uterine medicine, and whether the competing hospital is located within 20 minutes by car.
The target hospital should consider decommissioning and transfer some medical departments to other hospitals.
The medical expenses will be increased to 25 years, which will be 75 years old or older.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare aims to reduce the number of beds in hospitals that have 1246 thousand beds in 18 years.
Currently, the number of beds of "high acute period" and "acute period" that require medical expenses is large, while the rehabilitation is lacking for elderly people.
In order to respond to aging, it is necessary not only to simply reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
In the re編ation and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated the "regional medical concept" which determines the number of beds required for 25 years.
The whole country is divided into 339 areas, and local governments and healthcare professionals are discussing, but most of the local residents and seniors maintain a careful attitude, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare intends to contribute to the revitalization of discussions by publicizing the name of the hospital with a poor record.

Porkラra vac  9 prefectures Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fish ( fu Shimbun Web ) - Yahoo! News
On 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced the amendment of the deficiency guidelines that enable preventive vaccination of pigs that are not currently recognized.
The target area is a policy to select 9 prefectures such as Gifu, Aichi, etc. that are affected by the infection of pigs and wild boars.
The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is limited in the area, but the distribution of meat and processed products is admitted.
After public comments (invited opinions), we will aim to complete the procedure in October.
By using vac s and admitted distribution of meat, etc., it is no longer a "purifier country" certified by international organizations and can affect the export of pork.
After the occurrence of last September, Japan was temporarily pending.
In the amendment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set "Vac  Vaccination Recommended Area" based on expert opinions on areas with high risk of infection from wild boar to pig.
The vaccination program is created by the prefectures of which the target is vaccination, the period, the number of heads, and how to proceed.
Other 7 prefectures listed as recommended vaccination area are Saitama, Toyama, Fukui, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, Shiga.
When the guidelines have been revised, the region will consider the situation.
As a general rule, the movement of vaccinated pigs, essential fluids, fertilized eggs, carcasses, and つfacts is limited.
For meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of restricting distribution and the impact on farmers, and it is admitted to distribution outside the region.
In order not to spread the virus, we will thoroughly treat food waste.
 ing the safety of vaccinated pigs to prevent reputation.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the common sense meeting held in the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Empersion Headquarters.
In the future, we will conduct opinions and public comments to prefectures by October 7 and implement new anti-epidemic guidelines.
Unaffiliated Keisuke Nagata, approach to Man U!
Contact Us No money needed ” ( Football Channel ) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 Delivery
In the last quarter, he left Melbourne Victory in the Australian A-League, and the former Japan representative MF Honda Keisuke, who is currently unaffiliated, had a remarkable action.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, actually appeared in the game?
The truth of the ephemeral is revealed
Honda, who updated his Twitter on the 27th of Japan, said, “Please give us a offer. I don’t need money, but I need to play with a great team or a great teammate, “I’ve made a public approach to a club.
The other party who sent "Reverse Offer" is Manchester United, a world famous landmark.
Why Honda has made a grand request to the Premier League’s most powerful club?
In the article of "FOX Sports" published on 24th.
In the article titled “Five FWs in which Manchester United grabs in the crisis of injured persons,” five non-affiliated players were picked up.
There was a name of Honda among players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Juseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bonny.
Currently, in United, injuries such as MF Paul Pogba, DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FWトニーony Mars。, FW Marcus Rushford have been in emergency situations.
"Red Devil" directed by Ole Gunner Surshar is forced to lose 22 wins in the league, and has a problem with the quality of the front.
That’s why Australia’s media named Honda as a new battle candidate for theコ.
In the article, it is analyzed that the agreement of Kubota as a creative side player, not strictly speaking striker, can fill holes filled with And。 Perera.
The 9th place in the 18th match in Melbourne Victory was a solid record, but he said, “The 33-year-old Honda has to leave his entertainment to manage Cambodian nationals and gain full attention.”
Is Honda’s approach true?
For the veteran whose next Tokyo Olympics competed in the next year, it is also noted whether the United will move.
Completed 500 portable translation machines Free rental to Hamamatsu office and stores|Shizuoka Shimbun at S
Pokétók, a portable translation machine that lends free of charge to 500 stores in Hamamatsu City
Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it has completed 500 installations in stores in Hamamatsu City.
It is said that the translation machine is the first in Japan to be deployed in the same area, and it is noted whether it leads to improvement of the ability to respond to inbound travelers.

It occupies 60% of the Naka Ward of the city.
In addition to displaying the rental destination for the map app "Google Map", the location of the "shop for foreign languages" was confirmed by smartphone.
You can access from the site of Lake Hamana.
The 74-language Pokétók was launched in April with the initiative浜松d by nine organizations in the city of Hamamatsu, Japan’s largest inbound support city.

The person in charge of the office said, “I want to connect to the development of new foreign customers while the operating environment is severe.”
Ikemura Kansei is no need for the first shot?
Today's Caddy's Best Shot
1W shots are not necessarily tied up.
There is also a technique called "Direct Dora" that you want to throw a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance such as the second shot of par 5.
The 選手1W also has a large head volume and has a risk of scattering the ball, but there are players who practice this frequently on the tig ground.
Ikemura Kansei is the first time to win the tour.
The 7th year of the professional is 166cm tall, but it is currently 7th in the driving distance division (ave  304.02yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairway Wood.
In the spring, "I thought that the shot of the spoon (3W) is cut, and I tried to do the direct dora."
You may drop the ball from the practice round to the turf of the tea area, and you may have to sprinkle 1W.
In the case where big carry is required, it is used to make a lot of tea-up, but it is effective to use the direct dora in a small hall.
"It can be used in the hall where the eyes become knocked down."
270yd to 280yd in ballistic measuring instrument.
I don’t need 3W. The ディdy can be more secure than 3W.
Wood is only 1W in the ディdie bag from the Japan Tour Championship in June.
The second long club is a loft of 17 degrees UT.
The battle method that is surprised by the tour associates is also a voice of theギャラリー that leaks from the viewed gallery.
Kotsu says “I want to move the club to level.”
"Down blow, even if it hits with a touch panel, it does not fly straight. Go to the right if it is a cut orbit. Originally, I was doing a direct dora to correct the swing of 1W shot at the time of tie-up. In this practice, the Attack Angle (the angle of injection of the club) is also loose."
The ball is not captured, but it isのリスクd by the risk of ボール, so the left side can be turned off.
It is a professional technique that you can think of, though I say to Kantan.

Garcia Wedge Shot
I stretched about the first half, so I thought that it was a momentum in the second half, but the putter was not able to stretch easily, so it was regretful.
―Is the 6th Eagle, the 7th Burdy champion?
After hitting the bogie in #4, I also saw the par 5, so if I had a feeling of taking it, I saw a chip ineagle in #6.
I had a chance to get Burdy on the 7th, but I was regretted that I could not stretch it later.
―What did you get in this tournament?
It was good that I could keep the fairway in a narrow course because I didn't have a good condition.
There was no experience, so I learned a lot.
―What is the difference between regular competitions?
(e.g. smartphone) It was possible to take a camera.
I didn't care at all, but I was taking videos and videos.
I didn’t have any other changes, but I just co-hosted a tournament with few Japanese players, so I decided to match with the feeling that “I don’t lose to overseas players.”
The second half of the game will continue, but if you do not win more than one win, you can not aim for the prize king, so I want to win another prize. There is also a ZOZO Championship in the near future, so I will do my best to enter the top in the tournament so far.
How to prevent dementia and keep things down forgotten?
Interview / Text / Yoko 
Drugs for dementia that large pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are facing R&D.
However, it seems that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been cleared, and there is a possibility that it can be very light and forgetful.
I asked Professor Shunsuke Otsuki, Brain Graduation Center, Kinki University Hospital.
No dementia
― ― What is the current situation?
Everyone can become dementia when age is over.
However, it is believed that it takes more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
Drugs that are commonly used in Japan are already out of insurance indications in some countries overseas, and cannot expect outstanding curative effects.
On the other hand, death due to in ious diseases and accidents is reduced, and cancer death is also reduced due to the まendous advances in treatment of anticancer drugs, etc.
This is why patients with dementia are increasing.
It is necessary to set up an environment that can live safely in the entire community, not only by the person or family.
How to keep things forgotten
― Is there a person who is sensitive to dementia or is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that it can be suppressed as much as possible and it can be fastened to the degree of "forgetting things".
Dementia is considered as one of life-style diseases, and tends to be  ent.
First, metabolic people tend to be dementia.
Dementia is considered as one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are areas where food tickets are distributed to poor people, but food tickets are preserved frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
Gas and electricity can not be used, and people living in an environment that can not cook in the first place can be used.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life biased to lipids and sugars.
It is poverty, but it becomes obesity, and it is possible to do it.
It is possible that there is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to be dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, it is necessary to think about things by reading books from a day to day.
