If a small group of物のatures (a small number of individuals) is apart from a large group (e.g. moving across the mountains and rivers, or moving to a new island that cannot be easily returned), you will often notice that you are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different資源 from different resources, so new populations need different features and adaptations to what they needed and can be a powerful。.
The original population has not changed at all, but it still needs to be adapted like in the past.
When a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, it begins to present a different phase from other groups over time.
In the end, two groups of thousands to several millions of years have a different look than the same species.
This is called the most common species formation, which simply means the formation of new species. Seed formation is an inevitable result and is a very important evolution part.

For example, the film format of the most popular still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the mainstream film size around the end of the analog film era.
Although it is currently produced, the more important thing is that the aspect ratio inherits the format of the image sensor of the digital camera.
The size of 35 mm is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the aspect ratio of this format is 3 times.
Many of the general recording formats (e.g., APS記録 recording format) are similar or close to this aspect ratio.

Internet is an environment that combines both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The pronounced feature of the Internet leads to further dimensions from the viewpoint of the use and satisfaction approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as an important、 for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “co。ous relationship” have been identified as a new動機 when Eighmey &orord (1998) investigated the audience’s response to the website.
The use of video recordings leads to a micro-expression that lasts about a few milliseconds, i.e., an important discovery in interpreting facial movements.
In particular, by accurately interpreting the microscopic expression, it claims that the person is lying or not.
Oliver Sachs pointed out that even those who are unable to understand the speech due to a disorder in the brain can correctly evaluate their honesty.
He suggests that such ability to interpret human behavior is common to animals such as dogs.
In the 20th century study, there are two gene pools that are expressed as hidden in genetic mutations.
A new genetic mutations with mutations are added, and the selection is removed from the mu  pool, which is expressed.
In recombinant with the habits, the mutations are shuffled while going between two pools per generation.
It is difficult to take essential amino acids from plant resources in Savannah environment for primates with人間ve systems like humans.
In addition, if you neglect it, it leads to serious situations such as growth suppression, malnutrition, and ultimately leads to death.
The most accessible plant resources were protein contained in leaves and beans, but this is a nutrient that is difficult to digest if not cooked for our primates.
On the other hand, animal food (ali, siloary, egg) is a good source of protein that contains all essential amino acids that are easy to digest.
If you think about any point, it is not possible even if our ancestors have solved the problem of protein, just like chimpanzees that affect today’s savanna.
Sleep interruption is a process that intentionally  s up during normal sleep time and falls to sleep for a while (10-60 minutes).

In the United Kingdom, there was already a car road in the 16th century.
The freight road was layed in板 with the board material, but the horse pulled it, and it was able to transport large luggage more quickly than the time was rough road.
Pillow wood was introduced at a fairly early stage to fix the line to the place. Finally, when the tip of the iron is set at the top, the efficiency gradually increased.
This is common, but iron has become a cause of the wear of the wooden wheel of the horse carriage.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first steel rail was introduced.
The first known means of transportation was a walk, and the upright walking of humanity began at the time of the emergence of Homo Electras (the “right man”) 2 million years ago.
Austraropices, a direct ancestor, has no habit of continuing upright walks for a certain period of time.
Saharan Trops can be walked in two feet early 7 million years ago, but the characteristics of bipedal walking are confirmed with the fossils of Astraropitex between 390 and 420 million years ago.
I have been a 活動ist to start a more environmentally friendly life, participate in the environmental movement, and become an activist to reduce future suffering.

Science has now demonstrated that this large carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable conditions that have supported the evolution of humans over the past 2 million years.
Anyone who runs social life uses transportation. Most of them are dissatisfied with traffic systems.
In developed countries, there are few complaints such as water quality and bridge collapse.
Why does transportation cause such a complaint and fail on a daily basis? Is the technical staff of transportation only inefficient? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow research is a study of individual drivers and vehicle movements between two points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because it is possible to predict the behavior of the driver with 100% probability.
Fortunately, the driver tends to act within a reasonably consistent range, and therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have a reasonable consistency and can be expressed mathematically largely.
The relationship between the three main characteristics of (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed is established to better express the traffic flow.
These relationships help you plan, design and operate road facilities.
