Driving in high heels is dangerous!
Many accidents on the pedal of young people (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo! News
Violations of Road Traffic Law
The number of reports of accidents caused by mishandling, such as pedal missteps, is increasing and is attracting attention, but it is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem for elderly drivers.
In the number of pedal missteps by age group (data of the National Police Agency), the most common age was 1080cases under the age of 24years old, exceeding 1032cases for over-75s.
It is important to call attention to the same for young people, as it is never more common for the elderly to take the steps.
Do you want to take the sting of your feet?
Do you want to be safe?
This data does not describe the gender ratio or cause, but unlike elderly people who are thought to be due to a decline in the body such as driving skills and reflexes, young people may be distracted by other things such as music and conversation, and mistakes caused by inadvertent mistakes due to clothes, etc.
In particular, women choose high heels, pumps, sandals, mules, and various shoes depending on the day's clothes, and some people drive as they are.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think that it is suitable for driving, but there are many people who do not think about the possibility of danger at all and are driving without malicious intent.
However, driving with high heels and sandals is in conflict with the Road Traffic Act.
The first is “to operate the steering wheel, brakes, and other operations reliably” and “violation of safe driving obligations” stipulated in Article 70, “Do not drive in a way that causes an accident and harm to people.”
For example, the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations stipulate that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural public safety committee. For example, in the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law Enforcement Regulations, there is a sentence that says, "Do not drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) by wearing footwear that may interfere with driving operation, or wearing footwear that may interfere with driving operation, such as wearing shoes that may interfere with driving operation."
In each prefecture, the purpose of considering driving with "adhes that may interfere with driving operation" is the same as a violation, even if it is not specified as high heels.
Why is driving in high heels dangerous?
This is obvious when you consider the basics of pedaling safely.
In order to operate the pedal safely, first place the heel of the foot on the floor, place the foot on it so that it is perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when you press the accelerator pedal, tilt the foot to the right with it as a fulcrum.
At this time, it is important to keep the heel firmly fixed so that it does not shake regardless of the behavior of the car.
However, in high heels, the area where the heel is grounded on the floor is small, and it always shakes, and the heel height has an angle to the entire foot, so the area of the foot grounded to the pedal is also small and it is difficult to make fine adjustments.
I think this leads to danger.
In addition, most cars have a floor carpet, but this material makes it easy for the heel to catch the heel, and when it is a sudden brake, the heel is caught and the pedal can not step on it, or the high heel is taken off at the time of the heel caught, and it may not be able to step on it by being pinched by the back of the pedal.
In addition, there are cases where the heel gets stuck to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and then returning it, and the accelerator pedal does not return.

The U.S. and the minimum number of refugees accepted for three consecutive years, to eighteen thousand|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Tuesday announced a policy to reduce the number of refugees from around the world to 181,000 in the 2020 fiscal year.
It would renew the minimum number since 1980, when the Refugee Act was enacted, for three consecutive years.
The Trump administration is aiming to promote strict immigration and refugee policies to conservatives in the run-up to next year's presidential election.
With the constant number of people being driven out of the country in various places, it is inevitable that there will be criticism from human rights organizations and others.
The Obama administration set the upper limit for the 17th fiscal year to 11 million, but the Trump administration, which was inaugurated in January, overturned it and cut it to fifty thousand.
In the 18th fiscal year, it is forty-five thousand, and in the 19th fiscal year, it continues to decrease by thirty thousand.

Kinki Ceramics, a local industry in Hyogo and Awaji Island, manufactures "Awaji-gawara" manufacturer, filed for quasi-in-bankruptcy.
The sluggish housing market and the frequent earthquake damage caused by the "consumer's roofs" progressed.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB company code: 530173983, capitalized at 992 million yen, 881-8 Otani, Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, representative Kozo Fukuhara, 44 employees) filed for quasi-bankruptcy with the Kobe District Court on August 30.
Daichi Yoshida (1-10-8 Nishi-Tenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka; Yoshida Daichi Law Office, Tel: 06-6365-6038) and one other person were represented in the application.
The company was a tile manufacturer founded in June 1895s and reorganized into a corporation in April 1961.
Initially, he started his business as a local industry on Awaji Island in Nishitan-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minamiawaji City) under the trade name of Kinkigyogyo Co., Ltd. as a local industry on Awaji Island.
At the same time as the absorption-type merger of Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd. were succeeded, the head office was moved to the current location after changing to the current company name.
After that, it opened sales offices in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, etc., and became the current system, and it was mainly Ibushi tiles, but due to changes in consumer needs, Western tiles such as flat roof tiles are now 70% and Japanese tiles such as Ibushi tiles are manufactured at a rate of 30%.
The company has built a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building material trading companies, and roof construction companies.
It was well-known as the top tile manufacturer on Awaji Island.
However, demand was sluggish due to sluggish housing prices after the Lehman shock, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Kumamoto Earthquake, which caused consumers to leave their roofs due to the recent sluggish housing market, and the Kumamoto earthquake.
On the profit margins of the economy due to soaring fuel prices, the company was forced to face severe cash developments, with a series of losses due to excessive interest-bearing debt associated with inventory burdens and business fixed investment.
For this reason, although the Bank was trying to restructure its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the repayment conditions for borrowings, business conditions showed no signs of recovery and the cash flow was gradually tight.
We were unable to support our business activities here, and this was the measure.
The debt is currently under investigation, but is expected to be around two billion yen.

In addition to the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen in the spring of 2023, the city wants to attract accommodation facilities by moving from a day trip center to a stay-at-home type, with an eye on the opening of the entire prefectural section of the Chubu Jukan Expressway, the extension and renovation of the prefectural dinosaur museum (Katsuyama City) and enhancement of functions.
The private idle land next to the east side of the roadside station construction site is acquired.
Surrounded by Kuzuryu-gawa River, Takinami-gawa River, and prefectural roads, it is more than twice the size of a roadside station.
The municipal land development corporation will proceed with land negotiations from this fiscal year in the name of industrial housing complexes, and will proceed with land acquisitions and other purposes, and in the 21st fiscal year, land will be remediated.
According to the city, private businesses such as farmers' restaurants and harvest experience facilities, fast food, and restaurants have already asked to enter the market.
As for accommodation facilities, it was also revealed that the city is making a name for attracting hotels that are specialized in accommodation facilities adjacent to roadside stations planned by Sekisui House throughout the country.
Sekisui House is scheduled to expand into three locations in Fukui Prefecture, but several other cities and towns have expressed their intention to attract them and may compete.
The city is also planning to build parking lots.
Some members said, "The maintenance schedule is slow," and asked for speed-up, and some members said, "I hope that there will be no land that will fall asleep (unsold)."
Deputy Mayor Mikio Mizukami said, "I would like to promote the superiority of Katsuyama City by putting the prefectural dinosaur museum and ski jam Katsuyama in the foreground," and said, "I would like to promote the superiority of Katsuyama City by putting the prefectural dinosaur museum and ski jam Katsuyama in the fore."

The only remaining Tsuruga Kihi in the seed school is in a face-to-face with the Hokuriku region.
Tsuruga, who won a close match against Fukui Commerce in the quarterfinals, clashed with Hanami, who is currently riding the momentum of the tournament.
All of Tsuruga's Kihi, who appears in the first game, have won everything so far in the cold.
In the first round of the Asuka battle, the pitching is a quick victory.
In the second round of the Takefu Industrial War, Naoki Kasashima, who was active in Koshien this summer, climbed the board and showed the dignity of the ace with nine strikeouts in five innings.
Even in the three-country match of the quarterfinals, the batting line was left alone with 15th hit, and he greeted Hokuriku with a perfect posture.

In the first round of the Wakasa War, the pitchers stepped on and won with the lowest score.
The two-round battle of Takefu also lost two points.
In the quarterfinals, it was a close match with seeded Fukui Shoko 10-9, but it should have strengthened confidence by downing a competent school.
I also want to win the battle of Hamizu with a solid defense as a weapon.
[Team introduction] Tsuruga - a chance to win on the battery axis
On the other hand, Hayumizu defeated the seeded Fukui Kodai Fukui in the first round.
When he got on with the momentum, he won the Kintsu match with a swing of the fourth batter from a painful development.
The center axis, which the director also says has "destructive power", is also noteworthy in the semifinals.

I gradually got my response from about the beginning of June.

There was trial and error, but by challenging the hypotheses I had made one after another, my condition improved dramatically, and along with that, my grades have improved.

<One year since the Eastern Iburi Earthquake> Water secured even in the event of a power outage Installation of a "sprisoning fauced" directly connected to a water pipe Hakodate apartment: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
In response to the blackout (blackout) caused by the Eastern Iburi earthquake in September last year, measures are being taken at condominiums in Hakodate City, where water was cut off.
Seven condominiums have installed water fauceds that can provide water even after a power outage, according to the Municipal Bureau of Corporate Affairs and Sewerage, the Water and Sewerage Department of the City Enterprise Bureau said the water was installed in the year after the earthquake.
There are about four hundred condominiums and private housing complexes in the city that are four or more that are water supply in the "water tank type" that may be cut off in the event of a power outage, and the ministry is calling for consideration of countermeasures.
There are two main types of water supply for houses: the water tank type, which stores water in the underground or on the roof, and the water supply system, which is directly supplied to each house from the city's water distribution pipe.
In the water tank type, even if the water pipe is damaged, if the electric pump that pumps water from the receiving tank to each door does not move due to a power outage, it becomes impossible to supply water, and each house is cut off from water.

[See photos] The state of the drinking party of Hidetoshi Nishijima is clear!
"Ninyo Gakuen" First Day Stage Greeting
This is a poignant story in which the head of the yakuza, Aki Hongumi, who has no eyes for social contribution, takes on the rebuilding of a high school on the verge of bankruptcy and solves a number of difficult problems with his in-laws.
Nishida plays the strong but unhinged leader, and Nishijima plays the number two of the Akimoto-gumi, His Village, the number two of the Aki-hon-gumi, who is always turned around by his boss.
Nishijima said, "I was nervous until today," and had an undying look on the first day.
"Not only during the filming period, but also after the shooting, this group was a team with so much unity that they gathered and talked about various things all the time," he says.
Ito also laughed, “There was a reflection session, just a drinking party that did not reflect at all,” and “It was a positive thing for the site to be able to make such a time. Teamwork has improved and motivation has increased. It continues regularly even after the end, and I have many good memories.” He said that he spent precious time.

Prefectural Fisheries Federation "Start discussions for full-scale operation" Chairman Nozaki "Iwaki Minpo official website
With the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, discussions toward full-scale operation of the fishery off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture in each district have been decided to materialize.
On the 27th, the president of the prefectural fishing federation (the Federation of Fishery Cooperative Associations) was held at the prefectural Fisheries Hall in central Taii Iino, and the head of the prefectural union attended, and President Nozaki said, "I think that it is necessary for the prefectural fishing federation to make full-scale operations. I hope that each representative will gather and start discussions."
The union president's meeting also approved the official addition to the target fish species of fish for the maggots, sakura trout, and mulesoy off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where the shipping restrictions have been lifted.
The remaining two fish products were Binosgai and Common Kasbe.
After the meeting, Chairman Nozaki responded to the press interview, emphasizing that the start date of full-scale operations is undecided.
“The Keren-tasteful discussion is a problem, and the position against ocean release will not change,” he said, referring to the treatment of treated water after the contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station was purified, and he rejected the remarks of former Minister of the Environment Yoshiaki Harada and Mayor of Osaka City, Ichiro Matsui.
In discussing full-scale operations, Akira Egawa, head of the Iwaki City Fishery Cooperative (Fishery Cooperative), said, "It is necessary to absorb opinions from below," and said he respected the intentions of the members.
The board of directors is held, which is a group of branches, and after solving the problems they have one by one, they come to a conclusion as a municipal fishing cooperative.
"In addition to fishermen, it is necessary to discuss with middle-aged brokers," said Kanji Tachiya, president of the Soma Futaba Fishery Cooperative.
The Soma Futaba Fishery Cooperative, with the support of the government, said that it is important to return the catch first, because seven new ships will be included next year, and expressed the intention to promote the improvement of the environment in parallel with the discussion of full-scale operations.

“Beauty and ugly” is a piece of paper?
What is the image of "snakes" that overlaps with beautiful girls of Kazuo Kajizu's work (Magomics) - Yahoo! News
Do the mysterious beauty and the expression that dwells in the shadow have in common?
Since the 1950s, he has sent out numerous works to the world, and he has been a pioneer of "Fear Manga" and introduced "Kazuzu Kazuo Bishoujo Collection" (Genkosha) with a focus on beautiful girls drawn by Mr. Kazuo Kazu, who is known as the leading figure in "Fear Manga".
When I look at it in my hand, I am reminded again of the correlation between "beauty" and "fear" of Kazuo Kuzu's work.
[Image] Is it attractive because there is a "shadow"?
Beautiful girls of Kazuo Kajizu's work (five pieces)
In the beginning of the "Beautiful Girl Collection", there was a sentence that "fear, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story stand out only because of the beauty of the girls who are opposite", but the beautiful face is distorted and the expression of resentment that the resentment that has changed to the expression of resentment ... ...
There is a keyword "snake" in many of the works that appear in Kazuo Kuzu, but snakes are perceived as "seriously creatures" by the viewer, and there are people who feel "beautiful", and there are various ways to receive it.
Some people love reptiles, and some people don’t like them.
In that way, depending on the sensibilities of the viewer, the creatures that "beauty" and "ugly" are two sides of the same coin may be "snakes".
In addition, this creature has been revered as a creature with high spiritual power since ancient times, and it is said that the house where the "white snake" lived is said to be auspicious.
The "Snake" is based on the "Snake" in the "Hydala Girl" series and "Maihara no Shōjo" in the "Mama is Scary!" series.
For the most part, it is a beautiful woman with a shadow that becomes a "sheavior woman".
To put it in a shambles, I wonder if I can say "Cool Butty" type ... ... I feel that it is the commonality of the beautiful girls that appear in the Kuzu work.
Among them, "Orochi", which is the leading role of "Orochi" which was serialized in "Weekly Shonen Sunday" since 1969, is a beautiful girl character who can be said to be a representative of the 楳図 work, but in order to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, it is somewhat reminiscent of "snake" such as falling into deep sleep every hundred years and the part with mysterious power.

Deputy Defense Minister Tomohiro Yamamoto posted a comment along with a photo of Defense Minister Kazuchika Iwata, and deleted Twitter screen
Deputy Defense Minister Tomohiro Yamamoto deleted Twitter comments such as "It's delicious" when he ate at a yakitori restaurant in Saga Prefecture by the 27th.

On the same night, he tweeted, “I came to Saga Prefecture on a business trip!”

[Koshiyama Wakamizu] The circle of "children's cafeterias" that provide free or inexpensive meals to children is spreading throughout the country.
According to research by NPOs and others, about 3700 locations nationwide are active this year.
There are twenty-four locations in Fukui Prefecture, which has increased by nine from last year.
Why is it a children’s dining room now?
▼Makoto Yuasa, the president of an NPO and a social activist, talked about the background and significance of the lecture held in Sakai City.
Due to the declining birthrate and aging population, the area is lonely and the shopping district is also in decline.
There is no place for people to meet.
Therefore, "a regional exchange base where people and people are crowded with each other were required."
▼Even if it is a children's cafeteria, it is a "multi-generational exchange place" where elderly people also participate.
Not only will it eliminate solitary eating, but it will also lead to child-rearing support and the health promotion of the elderly.
Break the cycle of poverty and energize the region.
The important thing is not to have children who can be kicked out of it.
▼From once a month to serving meals every day, there are various places.
The venue ranges from several people to several hundred people, and the venues range from private homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere that people who want to do it can.
The low threshold is attractive.
However, it is difficult to secure management costs and staff.
You may also hear issues such as a safe management system.
Yuasa says, “Responsible values will change when you interact with many people,” and “connecting with society is a safety net in the event of a disaster.”
It seems to be a glimmer of hope for a closed society.
On the final day of the Fukui Prefectural High School Baseball Tournament in the fall, the final and third place decider will be held at the prefectural baseball stadium (Fukui City) on September 29th.
In the final, Tsuruga Kihi, who is aiming for the top spot for the first time in four years, and Tsuruga, who is aiming for his first win in 36 years, will fight in the autumn tournament.
The seeding school, Kihi Tsuruga, won three consecutive games from the first round.
In the semifinal against Hokuriku, ace Naoki Kasashima won the final pitching on pitching that tightened the key points.
The strikeout line was good with 13 hits, and I also want to support the pitchers in the final.
On the other hand, Tsuruga won from Nose.
In the quarterfinals, they won the close match by one point, and in the semifinals with Hayu, they ran away with a squeak, such as scoring a pre-emptive point in a squeeze.
I want to make sure that I have a chance in the finals to score points.
The third place decision match with one frame remaining in the Hokushinetsu tournament was Hokuriku - Hasui.
In Hokuriku, the starting point of the semifinals, the runner base and bunt were disturbed, but I want to rebuild in the third place decision game.
On the other hand, Hamizu attracted the attention of this tournament, such as defeating the strongman Fukui Institute of Technology.
It is interesting to see if we can win the third place decision battle of Hokushinetsu.

"The real culprit" that droned attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities (FRIDAY) - Yahoo! News
“The Iranian drone used in this bombing, the Abba beer, has dramatically improved its performance in recent years by analyzing the crashed U.S. military drone.
It is inexpensively manufactured and has a cruising range of about 1000km.
It is also a strength that it is difficult to be caught by radar because it flies low.”
On September 14, an oil facility at Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, was bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly after, Yemen's anti-government group "Hoosi" claimed responsibility.
“Behind the Houthis is Iran led by President Rouhani. Iran cannot allow its rival Saudi Arabia to make money from oil in a situation where it cannot export oil. If we continue to impose an oil embargo on Iran, we aim to make the international community aware that it will be painful to respond to it,” said Ie Sugawara, an international political analyst.
In the wake of the bombing, Saudi Arabia's total oil production of half of the country's total was halted, with oil prices hitting a 15 percent surge.
There are also voices that the oil shock will come again.
“As long as Trump has pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from the Middle East, he wants to avoid military intervention at all costs, at least until the election is over next year. After that, Iran will continue to bomb drones with the Houthis as a cover. However, the United States cannot stand it forever. There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future.” (Sapproximately Sugawara)
The "proxy war" between the United States and Iran is in a tactile crisis.
The reason why super-individual YouTubers became full-time employees.
Ask the president who hired (bizSPA!
9/27 (Fri) 8:47 PM
A YouTuber who is now extremely popular, mainly among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use them to advertise their own products, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber recruitment" that employs them as full-time employees in-house.
Direct Marketing Mix Co., Ltd. (DmMiX) is a company's main business, which is a CRM (customer relationship management) of a company.
What does it mean to “reopt a YouTuber”?
We spoke to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, the president of DmMiX and the representative of the subsidiary and staff first, who is actually adopted by YouTuber.
I want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber recruitment
How does YouTube adoption work in the first place?
Yuki Kobayashi (Kobayashi): The YouTube profession is now aspirational for many young people.
Elementary school students are also at the top of the career rankings they want to pursue in the future, and the number of young people aiming for will continue to increase.
Until now, we have hired young people who are chasing their dreams, such as bandmen and comedians, and have supported them.
In the same way, "YouTuber recruitment" is to hire young people who are chasing the dream of becoming a YouTuber and to support them.
There is an image that YouTubers are the ones that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you decide to “adopt”?
Kobayashi: While many young people yearn for the profession of YouTube, most YouTubers are unable to make the same revenue they think.
There are many creators who work part-time while making and posting videos, and creators who do not allow their families to recognize the existence of YouTubers.
In this initiative, we will provide the creators who hire them with an environment for salary and content creation.
At first, we are thinking of supporting the demerits of the profession of YouTuber, which becomes unstable at first, and we will support our activities.
Environmental Girl "Fighting for a Safe Future" Protests around the world for the second week in a row|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
Greta Thunberg (center) and others at a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada, on Monday (Reuters)
Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who advocates for global warming, said on Monday she took part in a protest in Montreal, eastern Canada, and stressed that she would “continue to fight for a safe future.”
The youth protests of the day followed in Asian countries, including Europe and the United States.
A large-scale protest in response to Greta's call was held for two consecutive weeks following the 20th.
Greta met with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau on Monday.
Trudeau, who is usually showing his enthusiastic stance on global warming countermeasures, also participated in the march.
But Greta, after the meeting, said of Trudeau that he “clearly lacked action.”
"I hope that South Korea will return to GSOMIA" Assistant Secretary of State of the United States (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
In an interview with the Sankei Shimbun at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Tokyo on Monday, Napper said he hoped South Korea would reconsider its decision to reconvene and return to the GSOMIA, which expires on November 23rd.
It is unusual for a senior U.S. official to refer to the reconsideration of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is a foundation for Japan, South Korea, Japan, the U.S., and South Korea to share missile launch information.
South Korea will notify in August that it would cancel the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military intelligence in Japan and South Korea will be broken.
Mr Napper insisted: "We cannot effectively respond to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time until it expires," he urged South Korea's return.
"This is the first time in history that China and Russia have conducted a joint flight drill over the Sea of Japan," he said, adding that "it is essential that the United States, South Korea and Japan, which share values such as democracy and human rights, work together in the alliance."
He pointed out that the recent deterioration in Japan-ROK relations "would harm the interests of the United States."
“There is no intention to mediate,” he said, adding, “I will play a positive role so that Japan and South Korea can bridge the gap.”

Tokai Village Criticality Accident, Twenty Years in Thirty-Day Nuclear Facilities Troubles: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Version
From the 2000s to the 18th year of the criticality accident in Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture, where the death toll from radiation exposure was the first in Japan's history of nuclear power, there were 336 reports of trouble with accidents and breakdowns at nuclear-related facilities nationwide, according to an interview with the Atomic Energy Agency on the 28th.
Twenty years have passed since the criticality accident that sounded the alarm over the safety myth of the nuclear industry.
According to the report, about ninety percent of the cases were classified as level zero (non-safety-critical) and cases that were not evaluated by the International Assessment Scale (INES), which indicates the severity of the accident, but it is necessary to constantly improve safety awareness based on the lessons learned from the accident and the TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
Koichi Muneda, who has completed the story and original drawings of the original picture book and is asking for donations for publication, on September 18th, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
Koichi Muneda, 64, an artist and member of the Echizen City Regional Revitalization Cooperation Team in Fukui Prefecture, started a crowdfunding campaign to raise donations on the Internet with the aim of publishing creative picture books inspired by the legends of the prefecture in order to promote community development using picture books.
Munoda, who was born in Hokkaido and started his activities as a support team in April this year, says, "I want to convey the compassion of the people of Fukui based on deep faith through picture books."
[Donation is here] To convey Fukui's heart.
Munoda is active as an artist who works on contemporary art with a motif of mathematics, but after his 60th birthday, he also works as a support team.
After working on community development in Nagano, Kumamoto, and Tochigi, he arrived in Echizen City in April this year.
In connection with the city that produced Satoko Kako and Chihiro Iwasaki, she aims to create a town that makes use of picture books.
When I lived in the city, Munoda said, "I was surprised by the depth of compassion around me that I understood for the first time."
The legend of Awara City, "The Face of the Oni of the Bride-to-wife Odoshi", attracted attention.
It is a story about a mother-in-law who can no longer take the face of an ogre, but a kind-hearted wife continues to chant Nenbutsu to help her mother-in-law without worrying about being surprised by the aspect.
“Forget the hatred and return it with compassion and kindness, I felt the origin of the piety and kindness of the people of Fukui” (Mousta).
In preparation for the original picture book, Munoda, who got a hint, made many interviews, such as going to Yoshizaki Mibo in Awara City as soon as he arrived, and completed the story "Meoto Oni" in which a gentle oni couple and a boy appear.
From June, he drew ten scenes with warm watercolors using his full-time job, and the materials of picture books were all set.
In addition, the cover of the picture book is planned to be made of Washi paper, which uses the traditional craft that lives in Echizen City.
It will lead to opportunities for parents and children to enjoy the texture of Japanese paper by reading stories.
For the publication of six hundred copies, the goal of the donation amount is eighty-five thousand yen.
The deadline is October 25th.
Mr. Munoda said, "Fukui's heart, which has been nurtured under the historical Buddhist culture, can be proud of all over the country.
I want to convey what true kindness and compassion are passed down to children through picture books."
Fukui Prefecture has certified eleven projects for regional revitalization that the cooperation teams and businesses in the prefecture are challenging, and it is one of the projects that supports using the hometown tax payment.
The Fukui Shimbun is cooperating with the dissemination of information, and Fukui Bank is cooperating with management support.
You can donate from the crowdfunding site "Lady Four".

A company employee who visited the Kurashiki store (Hiraku-cho, Kurashiki City) to buy a suit to wear for the coming-of-age ceremony (19) = Asaguchi City = "The ceremony is still ahead, but I want to buy it before the tax increase."
In this tax increase, the tax rate on food and beverages will be fixed under the reduced tax rate system, so at home centers and supermarkets, we will appeal to daily necessities and sake.
At the home center's Time Takaya store (Kaneki, Naka-ku, Okayama City), a special corner with large-capacity detergents and tissues is developed near the entrance.
Sales of daily consumables increased one to six times from the same month last year, and “If you do not replenish it many times a day, you will be cut off” (store manager Seiya Shimizu).
A 63-year-old civil servant in the city who came to the store said, "I'm going to buy it anyway, so I'm going to take this opportunity," and bought a kitchen paper in bulk.
The Tenmaya Happy Town Okanan store (Tsukiko Shinmachi, Minami-ku, Tokyo) also set up a wagon loaded with detergents, toilet paper, and disposable diapers at the event hall.
A 35-year-old company employee in the city said, "If you receive a point return for cashless payments, the burden will hardly change, so you don't have to rush to buy daily necessities."
2019Best Director Klopp Honors Biggest Enemy General of 2019 "Best Director" (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! News
Jürgen Klopp, who won the best director award for The Best, reflected on his career in an interview and also left a comment on the current situation.
What surprised the public among his many remarks was his biggest rival in the Premier League title, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.
Neymar's best friend Alves says: "His happiness is still at Barca... "
After the The Best awards, the German commander said, “I never imagined something so great. I was very happy and proud to receive this award. It was a wonderful few days for me. Thanks to my players, I was able to win the award. The most important thing is the team.”
Regarding Guardiola, Klopp said, “I respect him very much” and said, “What can I say about him? He has won many titles. His style of playing is exceptional. He is the best director I have ever played against, and it is an honor to be nominated and competed with him for the award.”
He also mentioned manager Pochettino and Tottenham.
“Last year was incredible. In many cases, if you don’t win the title, you won’t be remembered. Gradually, the team was building up and playing in a great style.”
Klopp was undecided about the best moment of the year, he said, “(CL) It’s a reversal against Barcelona. Many experts and myself wouldn’t have been betting on us for a centimetre. With a 3-0 behind-the-scenes against a team with Messi and Suarez. It's like a death sentence. We got a small chance and we were able to make it happen. I couldn't believe it. Looking back, I might be able to say that I won this game. This match will be remembered by everyone."
At the end of the day, Klopp was asked a more personal question, “When I congratulated the Bundesliga win, I woke up on a bench and didn’t even know where I was. This time, it didn’t happen. I don’t like to get drunk because I’m a person who was plagued by self-management obsession. The blessing of CL domination was very modest. I remember it all. If I had lined everyone up in front of me, I might be able to identify all the people I saw from the bus.”

I want to use Sidecar.
According to Apple, macOS Catalina, the new operating system that will be available in October.
The exact date has not been revealed, but it may be delivered on October 4th.
Could the macOS Catalina release date be October 4th?
The image above was posted on Apple’s website in Denmark (now fixed).
There is certainly a letter "from October 4 (fra den 4. oktober)" in the image.
On the official website, the accuracy of this information is also high.
By the way, the most important feature I personally want to try on macOS Catalina is “Sidecar”.
This is a function that treats iPad as a sub-display of Mac, and it is a function that was previously realized in third-party applications.
And since Sidecar is a genuine Apple feature, it is expected that it is better in perfection (and response).
There are rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first you want to fully experience this next-generation macOS.
Growing sakura shrimp in the process of growth PT, water depth 290m shooting in Shizuoka City, etc.|SHIZUOKA SHIMBUN AT S
Sakura shrimp born this year who succeeded in shooting in the deep sea of Suruga Bay = 11th, off the coast of Kamahara, Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka City (provided by "Yui Sakura Ebi Project")
The Yui Sakura Shrimp Project, a member of the Marine Industry Cluster Council of Shizuoka City and other organizations, has recently succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp, which is believed to have been born during the spawning season in spring and summer this year, on the seabed at a depth of 290m in Suruga Bay.
The images of the growth process are valuable, and the people involved want to lead to the elucidation of the ecology of cherry shrimp, which is often mysterious.
The photo was taken near the seabed about one and a half kilometers offshore in the Kamahara area of Shimizu Ward, the same city.
I checked about three hundred in seventeen minutes.
The conventional knowledge that cherry shrimp in the deep sea in the deep sea during the day forms a certain amount of herds on the seabed was again supported.
The adult body was about 40mm long, and the individual that was reflected was about 23mm long.
We identified the spawning season by comparing it with seasonal data of the sakura shrimp landed.
For detailed analysis, Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka Industrial Technology College, which make up the team, will be requested.
Keisuke Mizuno, project leader, says, "We want to capture the living figure of individuals in the growth process, including young shrimps."

[Bud Olympic race first half] World champion Kento Momota, good Shutensei leads one step!
<Men's Singles> (Bad x Spi!
The Japanese national team, which won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Basel, Switzerland), a big badminton event held in August, will compete in the Chinese Open (Super1000) starting on the 17th after the training camp for strengthening in early September.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the first round from May to August, when the Olympic race for next year's Tokyo Olympics began, and look forward to the men's singles for the midfield (September-December) (Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
The badminton Olympic race, which started in May, digested four top competitions (Super500 or higher) in which the top players competed at the end of the world championships.
Kento Momota, who won two of the four tournaments, and Cho Tiancheng of Taiwan, both of whom have been doing well in the first half of the tournament, will have been the two players who have been doing well.
Momota won the World Championship, Shutenjo won the Indonesian Open (S1000) and the Olympic race, where he can earn high points for "World Ranking Points" that are directly connected to the Olympic race.
Momota also controls the Japan OP (S750).
The four tournaments that have been competing since May are the Sudiruman Cup (May / China), the Indonesian OP (July / the result is 16th), the Japan Open (July) and the World Championship (August).
Although the number is small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that reduces the burden on the body.
Since there was only one world championship in August, fatigue will not be much greater than during the consecutive war.
A good result is required in the midfield battle where the top tournaments from September onwards are consecutive.
A strong Taiwanese ace in a row.
Pay attention to the young people of Thailand!
Shu Tensei, who also won the top tournament of the Indonesian OP and the Thai OP (S500), has already participated in seven tournaments.
He also participated in the local Taipei OP (S300) at the beginning of September, and won the championship wonderfully.
A player who has a strong physicality and does not suffer from consecutive fights.
Even if the tournament continues, there are no major problems with the performance of the game.
Rather, it would have been easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament to be played in the future by scoring high points in the first half.
Until last year, Shutenjo had the impression that he lacked explosive power, but this year, the stability in terms of play has increased, so it has become possible to continue good results firmly.
For Momota, who is ranked number one in the world, it is likely to be a troublesome opponent more than ever.
In addition to these two players, Thailand's young ace Kantaphone and India's Sai Pranis B. left results in the first half of the game. .
And there are three players of Anders Antonsen who are struggling alone as a European team.
Although Cantaphone did not advance to the finals in the top tournament, he has gained the power to advance to the top, such as entering the top four in the two tournaments this season.
There is still a rough side, but the 20th year old (21years old on the 18th) who can rally on equal with the top players seems to have a lot of potential to leap in the Olympic race.
Sai Planis B. also took a step away from India, which has good players in the singles.
Samir Barama, Planoy H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who is lagging behind in injury, will follow up in the future, so attention should be paid to the Indian team after the midfield game.
New Mobile Phone Charges: Price Reductions in Fair Competition: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Electronic Version
A new pricing plan for mobile phone companies was released in accordance with the implementation of the revised Telecommunications Business Act in October.
But it became mostly high.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said last summer that there was "room for a quarter to go down" and that price competition did not occur even though expectations for price cuts were high.
Rakuten's full-scale entry has been postponed, and the oligopoly of the three major companies continues to be a major factor.
For consumers, it is desirable to have a fee system that is easy to use with fair competition.
I want to see the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The revised law prohibits the discount of the set of terminal fee and communication fee.
This is because the communication fee was set to be expensive instead of selling the terminal fee at a low price.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) have announced plans to reduce their devices by up to half price.
However, both companies have a "SIM lock" that can not be used for other companies' lines for a hundred days.
NTT DOCOMO will reduce the cost of the terminal to a maximum of one-third for subscribers of its own line.
It seems that all three companies are continuing to "cive" to prevent them from transferring to other companies.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has indicated that the SIM lock will be required to be immediately released.
Businesses also need to act quickly.
Rakuten's postponement is due to the failure to proceed as planned by the development of telecommunications networks such as base stations.
It was expected to be a trigger for the price reduction competition, so it was dressed with a slender shoulder to shoulder.
Was there a sweetness of the prospect?
The timing and price of the full-scale service are also not clear.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I want you to take responsibility for your business.
This price change was triggered by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga's remarks.
Mr. Kan expressed his dissatisfaction with the new fees of the three companies, saying, "I think that the competition will start from now on. I do not think that it is good at all as it is."
However, I do not think that a "government-made price reduction" distorts the market and promotes healthy competition.
Companies should develop customer-oriented competition before they are interfered by the government.
The pricing structure of each company is very complex and easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention to the fact that there are cases where the burden on consumers exceeds half the price, even though the device is advertising such as "up to half the price".
Companies themselves must keep in mind a polite and easy-to-understand explanation so as not to create misunderstandings among users.

[Rugby World Cup] One-shot exit & brawl overseas ripples "insulting and despicable play" to the "face danger tackle" of US players (THE ANSWER) - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Quill rough play, former England squad 'not what you can call a tackle'
The Rugby World Cup (World Cup) in Japan was the 26th, and the United States, which was the last appearance in twenty countries to participate, defeated England 7-45.
It became a black star launch, but the rough play played by FL John Quill in the second half is causing ripples.
A one-shot exit in the form of adding a shoulder tackle to the opponent's face.
The actual scene was also released with a video in overseas media, and the former England national team player also complained that it was "insulting and despicable play" and "not what can be called a tackle".
[Video] "Insult and despicable play" and overseas ripples!
A one-shot exit, a commotion where players from both armies are in a mess ... The actual moment of the "face danger tackle" played by the U.S. representative Quill
The hot fight has crossed the line.
It was the 29th minute of the second half that we got 0-38.
Deep in the enemy line, England captain Farrell lost his balance when he caught a pass from his side.
It was Quill who went to the tackle on this.
However, he raised his upper body, not from the waist down, and hit his upper body violently on the upper body.
As a result, the other person's head and head come into contact, and it is in a shape that causes the head to hit the head.
Farrell was violently blown away and fell down.
The Englishman protested against the clearly lacking legitimacy, trying to push Quill away.
The two players gathered at once, and the air became a quick blow.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill was sent off with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad face, but some spectators who wanted fair play also booed.
The local media of rugby's strong New Zealand "Staff" featured the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: U.S. players leave with a despicable play, England win".
"Kill made a despicable shoulder charge on the face of England star Farrell, and he was out of the box." "It was a brawl between almost both sides."
The article introduces the comments of former England international and commentator Hugo Monya.
"It's insulting, it's despicable. It's not a tackle. It's a despicable play," he said.
The United States, which lacked one game, managed to escape the complete defeat with a nasty try in the 81st minute.
But Quill's play left with a bad aftertaste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) released the names of 424 hospitals that were judged to be "poor in medical care" among 1455 public hospitals nationwide and public hospitals such as the Japanese Red Cross.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare verified the treatment results of fourteen public and public hospitals, ▽ National Hospital Organization Awara Hospital in Awara City ▽ Sakai City Mikuni Hospital ▽ Oda Hospital in Echizen Town ▽ Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town ▽ Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town ▽
⇒Four hospitals subject to reorganization "standards are crazy"
In order to control medical expenses that are expanding due to the aging of the population, it is necessary to encourage reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions, so we decided to take an unusual response.
In October, the hospital requested full-scale consideration of reorganization and integration, and plans to have a conclusion reached by September next year.
There is no force, but local chiefs and residents are expected to rebel against the fear that there will be no more hospitals nearby.
It was made public at a meeting on the same day.
The target hospitals accounted for 29-1% of the total, and there were many hospitals with relatively small beds.
By prefecture, the percentages were high in the order of Niigata (53 and 7%), Hokkaido (48 and 6%), Miyagi (47 and 5 percent), Yamaguchi (46, 7%), and Okayama (43 and 3%).
The number of targets was the highest in Hokkaido, with the number of targets being the highest in Okinawa, and the only zero in Okinawa.
Based on the data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare surveyed 1455 hospitals in public and public hospitals that can respond to the "highly acute phase" for seriously ill patients and the "acute phase" for general surgery.
The researchers analyzed the nine-item medical record, including cancer and emergency medical care, and whether the competing hospitals are in a place "within twenty minutes by car" to determine the necessity of publicizing the hospital's name.
The target hospitals should consider abolishing it and transferring some departments to other hospitals.
Medical costs will soar in the 25th year that all baby boomers will be over the age of seventy-five.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set a target of reducing the number of beds in hospitals with twelve hundred and sixty-six thousand beds nationwide to eleven thousand beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "highly acute" and "acute phase" where nurses are carefully arranged and medical expenses are incurred, but there is a shortage for rehabilitation with high needs for elderly people.
In order to cope with the aging population, it is necessary not only to reduce the number of beds, but also to increase the number of rehabilitations.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture has formulated a "regional medical care initiative" that stipulates the number of beds required in twenty-five years.
The country is divided into 339 districts, and municipalities and medical personnel are discussing it, but many local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious attitude, and the discussion is difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to revitalize the discussion by publishing the name of the hospital, which has a poor track record.
Mt.Komagatake eruption assumption, comprehensive disaster prevention drill such as road participation, wide area with the participation of residents, for the first time in eighteen years (video) : Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
On September 27th, a comprehensive disaster prevention drill was conducted in the forest, Nanae, and Shikabe-cho in Watarishima Kannai, assuming the eruption of Mt.Komagatake (11131m).
About four hundred people, including officials and residents of twenty organizations such as roads and three towns, participated.
The Hokkaido Komagatake Volcano Disaster Prevention Council has held the event for the first time since it formulated an evacuation plan in August that included evacuation routes for residents.
It is the first time in eighteen years that a wide-area training in which residents participate.
It is assumed that Mt.Komagatake erupted at 8:45am and muddy drift reached the town at the foot of the mountain.

Sixteen-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, a student-emsiding centering on students, marched in Vancouver on September 27th to protest against climate change.
Climate protests in Vancouver
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall to the Canbe Bridge to the downtown library.
People with placards began to gather in front of the city hall of the meeting place a few hours before the start, and at 13th the start time, the number of people who filled the road in front of the city hall several blocks in front of the city hall.
After that, the number of participants continued to increase, and in the end, more than a hundred thousand people participated.
On the roads along the way, the police also put road restrictions in place to cooperate, and watched until everyone was finished walking for several hours.
In conjunction with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, Vancouver has held a number of events to discuss global warming since the end of last week.
On the 27th of the last day, there was a school strike called "Fridays for Future".
The students who took a break from school on this day appealed to adults to protect the earth even if they take time off from school, and many adults who participated in the absence of work answered, "We will do our best for the future of children who are seriously learning and thinking."
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced a draft amendment to the epidemic prevention guidelines that allow preventive vaccination of domestic pigs, which are not currently permitted, in order to prevent the spread of the livestock epidemic "pork cholera".
The policy is to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefectures, where pigs and wild boars have been confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The movement of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the region is permitted.
After public comments to the general public (public opinion solicitation), we aim to complete the procedure as early as October.
By using vaccines and allowing the distribution of meat outside the region, it may no longer be a "clean country" certified by international organizations, and may affect pork exports.
Since the outbreak in September last year, Japan has been temporarily on hold for the status of a clean country.
In the revised plan, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries set up a "promised vaccination area" based on the opinions of experts on areas where there is a high risk of transmission from wild boar to pigs.
The target prefectures will create a "vaccination program" that summarizes the range, timing, number of vaccinations, and how to proceed, and will be approved for use by the governor at the governor's discretion after receiving confirmation from the ministry.
The other seven prefectures that are recommended for vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie, and Shiga.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will take a look at the situation and make a decision again.
In principle, the movement of infected pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses, excrement, etc. shall be restricted to the region.
Meat and processed products are not covered based on the cost of restrictions on distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and will be allowed to be distributed virtually outside the region.
In order not to spread the virus, we will thoroughly dispose of food waste.
We will also work to prevent harmful rumors by appealing to the safety of the pigs that have been vaccinated.
The revised guidelines were compiled at a meeting of experts held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the epidemic prevention headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments to prefectures will be implemented until October 7th, and new epidemic prevention guidelines will be implemented.
Keisuke Honda, open approach to Man U!
"Give me an offer, I don't need any money" (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57 PM Delivery
Keisuke Honda, a former Japan international who left the Australian A-League Melbourne Victory only last season, has taken a surprising step.
[Video] Keisuke Honda, were you actually in the game?
The truth of heaven will be revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter account at midnight on the 27th in Japan time, said, “Please make an offer. You don’t need money, but you need to play with a great team and great teammates,” and made a public approach to a club.
The opponent who made the "reverse offer" is Manchester United, a world-famous country.
Why did Honda make a grand request to one of the Premier League's most powerful clubs?
The story is based on the Australian version of Fox Sports, which was released on the 24th.
In an article titled "Manchester United could grab in the midst of a continuing crisis of injuries, five unaffiliated players were picked up.
Among the players such as Khatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfredo Bonnie, there was also the name of Honda.
United are currently in an emergency with injuries including midfielder Paul Pogba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, FW Antony Martial and midfielder Marcus Rashford.
The "Red Devils" led by manager Ole Gunnar Sulechar have been forced to make a painful start with two wins and 22 losses in the league, and they are facing challenges in the quality of the front.
Therefore, it was Honda who listed the name as a candidate for a new force for the Australian media to take advantage of the attack.
“Strictly speaking, Honda’s contract as a creative player, not a striker, can fill the hole that Andreas Pereira is filling.”
“The 33-year-old Honda needs to move away from his entertainment to manage the Cambodian national team and get full attention,” he said.
Will Honda's approach work?
It will also be interesting to see if United will move on for the veteran, who is professing his goal to participate in the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Completed installation of 500m portable translation machines Free loan to Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce, stores, etc.|SHIZUOKA SHIMBUN AT S
Pokétoke, a portable translation machine that is loaned free of charge to five hundred stores in Hamamatsu City
On the 26th, the Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced that it has completed the installation of a total of five hundred units at stores in Hamamatsu City in a project to lend the portable translation machine "Poke Talk" to member offices free of charge.
It is said to be the first in Japan to intensively deploy the translator in the same region, and it will be interesting to see if it will lead to an improvement in the ability to respond to inbound tourists (travelers to Japan).
The breakdown of the loan destination is 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
The city’s mid-terms account for six percent.
We also started to display the loan destination to the map application "Google Maps", and made it possible to know the location of "stores that support foreign languages" with smartphones.
It can be accessed from the Hamanako sightseeing area website.
The free loan of PokéTalk, which supports seventy-four languages, was launched in April in April after the declaration of "Japan's best inbound support city Hamamatsu" by nine organizations in the city.
The Chamber will purchase five hundred units and rent them out for two years to small and medium-sized business establishments that meet the requirements of obtaining hospitality certification and introducing cashless payments.
A representative from the office said, "I hope that it will lead to the development of new customers for foreigners in the midst of a severe sales environment."

The recent 1W has a risk of the ball scattering due to the large head volume, but there are players who frequently practice this on the Tiground.
Hiroyo Ikemura is waiting for his first victory on the tour.
The 24-year-old, who is in his seventh year as a pro, is currently 7th in the driving distance category (average 304.02yd).
While he was good at long shots, one of the challenges was the accuracy of the fairway wood.
In early spring, "The shot of the spoon (3W) was not good, so I thought I would try to do a straight Dora" and opened his eyes.
From the practice round, the ball is dropped on the turf of the tea area, and sometimes 1W is shaken off to the grass.
In cases where big carry is required, tee-up is used a lot, but Naodora is effectively used in halls where both sides are narrow.
“You can use it in a hall where your eyes are down.”
In the ballistic instrument, 270yd to 280yd with a carry.
"That's why I don't need 3W. The caddie is also more secure than 3W ... ???
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, there is only 1W of wood in the caddie bag.
The second longest club is the UT of the loft 17 degrees.
The tactics that are surprised by the tour friends are also happy to hear the exclamations leaking from the gallery that I saw.
The trick is to "be at the level (horizontal) of the club."
“Even if you hit the down blow or hit the upper, you will not fly straight. If it is a cut track, it will go to the right. Originally, I was doing a straight Dora to correct the swing of the 1W shot (at the time of the tee-up). In this practice, the attack angle (club angle) also slows down.”
The ball is not caught, and it involves the risk of slicing, but "so the left side can be erased (not bent to the left)".
I tell Canada, but it is a professional skill that I can not think of.

Greta Toonberli: Why do adults laugh and threaten children?
Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg gave a speech on September 23rd at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.
While the speech has been attracting attention, there have been outstributing messages that insult Greta.
Greta Thunberg: Why Do Adults Laugh and Threaten Children?
A political commentator told an American television show that Greta is "morly ill, it is being used by her parents and the international left wing," and the television station that used it apologized.
In Japan, there are many messages on the Internet that comment on the parts that are not Greta's remarks, such as "I'm sorry for being used" and "I'd better go to school" about Greta-san.
On September 26th, Greta posted on Twitter, “Why do adults spend so much time laughing and threatening teenagers and children?”
“I come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as I can think of.”
Greta began posting, “Look, it started again. As you notice, people who hate me are still active. They follow me around my looks, my clothes, my attitude, and I’m different from people. They come up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as I can think of,” she said.
He pointed out that adults do not want to face climate and environmental crises, so they appear to be slackening their issues.
To be honest, I don’t understand why adults spend so much time laughing and threatening teenagers and children.
You can do something good at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't spend your time paying attention to them any more.
The world is starting to wake up.
Change is coming.
Even if adults like the change, they don’t like it.
See you on the street on Friday!
On the 20th of the previous Friday, there were strikes on climate change in New York and other parts of the world.
Greta also called on Friday the 27th to do so.

Garcia's wedge shot
I was able to stretch it to a certain extent in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but the putter did not go well and I could not stretch it, so that was frustrating.
Did you see the eagle on the 6th and birdie at the 7th?
Even after hitting a bogey at the fourth, there were still par fives left, so if I was doing it with the feeling of getting it back, Chip-in Eagle came to the 6th.
Even in the 7th, I got a birdie and I had a chance, but I was disappointed that I could not stretch in the second half.
What did you get at the meeting now?
I haven't been feeling well lately, so it was good that I was able to keep the fairway firmly even on a narrow course.
The rough was also a course where the order and the reverse of the order were different and the way of hitting and the distance changed, so I did not have much (experience), so I learned quite a lot.
How is it different from a regular meeting?
It was a place where camera shooting was possible (such as a smartphone).
I didn't mind it at all, but the gallery was shooting a lot of videos.
There were not many other things that changed, but there were few Japanese players in the tournament, but there were few Japanese players in the co-hosting tournament, so I went to the game with the feeling that "I will not lose to overseas players".
The second half of the race will continue, but if you do not win more than one win, you can't do it to aim for the prize money king, so I want to win another one, and I will do my best to qualify for the entry by entering the top in that tournament because there is a ZOZO Championship up close.
How to prevent dementia and keep it to the extent of "forgetting things"?
Interview / Text / Yo Watanabe
A medicine for dementia that major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrated by the challenge of research and development.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has become clear that it is extremely mild and may be able to keep things to the point of forgetting things.
We spoke with Professor Shunsuke Otsuki of the Stroke Center at Kinki University Hospital.
Dementia will not go away
Dementia prevention or treatment is expected, but what is the current situation?
Otsuki: Everyone may have dementia as they age, regardless of the degree of difference, from mild to severe.
However, it is believed that it will still take more than 20 years for a new dementia drug to be developed.
The drug Donepezil, which is often used in Japan, is also not covered by insurance in some countries overseas, and it is not expected to have a noticeable complete healing effect.
On the other hand, while deaths from infectious diseases and accidents are decreasing, and cancer deaths are decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment of anticancer drugs, people can now live longer.
As a result, it is also true that the number of people with dementia is increasing.
It is not only possible for the individual and his family to be able to solve the problem, but it is necessary to create an environment in which society as a whole can live with peace of
How to “forget” things.
Are there people who are more likely to have dementia or who are difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to have dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress symptoms as much as possible and keep it to the level of “forgetting things”.
Dementia is considered as a lifestyle-related disease, and people tend to be prone to it.
First, people with metabolic syndrome tend to be more prone to dementia.
Dementia is considered as a lifestyle-related disease.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia.
The lack of economic power also affects.
For example, in the United States, there are areas in the United States that distribute food vouchers called food vouchers to the poor, but the foods you can get with food tickets are frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens that can be stored.
It can be used by people who can not use gas or electricity and live in an environment where they can not cook in the first place.
Then, it becomes a diet with low vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life that is biased to lipids and sugars.
Eventually, you will be poor but obese, and the only thing to do is to watch TV and your body becomes disabled.
A similar situation can be found in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things and do not work tend to be more likely to develop dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is not a metaphor, it is necessary to read books and think about things on a daily basis.

At thirteen locations, including the former Uchiyamashita-ko (Marunouchi, Kita-ku, Okayama-shi) and the Tenjinyama Cultural Plaza (the same Tenjin-cho), about forty pieces of video and three-dimensional works will be shown.
Before the opening ceremony, an opening ceremony was held at the same small building, and about a hundred people from the people involved attended.
Mayor Masao Omori and general producer Yasuharu Ishikawa, the chairman of the executive committee, said, "There are works that stimulate intellectual sensibilities and creativity to stir up imagination and creativity. If it becomes an exhibition that attracts attention from the world," and cut the tape.
Families and out-of-school students who visited immediately watched the snake-shaped robot that reacted to the surrounding sounds in the ring of the schoolyard and turned their bodies around, and toured the school building, which turned into a stage for a video work depicting the world three thousand years later.
I was enjoying the art of the other world.
A 15-year-old high school student in Tokyo, who is traveling with his father, said, "The works that make use of the atmosphere of the old school building are interesting. Let me imagine the time that flowed to this place."
Closed until November 24th on Mondays (or the following day if Monday is a national holiday).

Five years have passed since the Umbrella Movement, and the people gathered at the meeting venue = 28th, Hong Kong (joint)
On the 28th, five years after the "Umbrella Movement" began to democratize the Hong Kong chief executive election, tens of thousands of people held a rally in a park near the Hong Kong government headquarters building of Admiralty, where the largest base of the demonstrators were located.
Around the venue, some young people occupied the main road and threw flaming bottles at the government building.
As protests continued to stem from the amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the participants renewed their determination to fight until the realization of a "true general election" that they could not win at the time.
The protests, which began in earnest in June, were 112 days, more than the 79th day of the Umbrella Movement, and the demands of the demonstrators have expanded to the "Five Major Demands" such as electoral system reforms.
