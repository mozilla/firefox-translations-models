Full-page cut report (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long [Minna-kaze] Fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka is a challenge to hairstyles with movements like Minami Tanaka, who longs for "beautiful, of course, but professionalism is very high and I respect it!"
I asked Mitsuteru Asahi of SunVALLY, a hair salon in Omotesando who actually works on the haircut of Minami Tanaka, and asked her to make it "Minna-style hair".
Report that cut process!
Nogizaka46 Mizuki Yamashita, short hair and the first cover!
First, check your hair before you cut.
Thin, soft, and more.
There is a habit, especially during the rainy season, so you can put a straight perm on it.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing bangs.
The cut begins!
First, lightly wet the whole thing so that it is easy to cut.
After that, separate the bee (the part above the top of the head's protruding circumference) and cut it from the bottom.
By the way, the hair point that everyone can get close to the real is here!
1 Tabblebang By shortening the inside of the bangs a little, you can enjoy the change depending on the styling, such as slightly thicker when you lower it in full, and it makes the skin see-through if you divide it lightly.
2 Cuts that make use of habit If you have a habit of high-haired hair too much, it may spread out.
While consulting with the balance around it, it is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and keeps the balance that your own swells live.
3 Layers and hair around the face Layer = cut with steps.
If you put a layer around the face, it will be easier to move and it will have a cute finish.
If you make your hair in three places, before the temple, the front and back of the miage, it looks fashionable even when you put your hair together.
If you cut the hair on the bee, it is around the face.
Pull out the hair bundle of the upper part around the face in front of you and cut the hair tip a little.
In this way, when the hair bundle is lowered, the step is attached, and it is easier to move (this is a layer cut).

In particular, bicycle accidents have occurred in the past five years, and the rate of accidents in the past five years has also exceeded the prefectural average, and we planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was multiplied by the meaning of "bike" and "bicycle" for accident eradication.
In traffic safety classes, we will encourage related organizations to instruct the elderly on driving and use of luminous reflectors, such as in traffic safety classes.
The police station will issue a yellow card (guidance warning ballot) during the crackdown, etc., and warns of caution.
The commencement ceremony of the operation was held on the 21st at the Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City.

The person in charge of the police station showed the policy and the activities of each organization.
As a starting event for the operation, we held a bicycle class.
The participants demonstrated how the impact of the bicycle is different, such as when a police officer in a car hits a bicycle by applying the brake and hitting a bicycle, and when it collides at about 55km/h without stepping on the brake.
"I felt the horror of traffic accidents again. I wanted to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people," said Koichi Kaneuchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Traffic Safety Activities Promotion Council.

Butler praises Tyler Hero, the future of the Heat, again "thought is not that of a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo! News
Photo by Getty Images The first match of the heat's scrimmage (practice match) was against the Kings.
In this match, Duncan Robinson won 104-98 with a team-high 18 points, followed by a 15-pointer on the backcourt, followed by a team-high 18.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, as well as the 13th overall pick of the draft, the step-up of the hero, will be an important factor for the Heat.
The hero missed fifteen games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and his return game against the Hornets on March 12th was the last time the season was interrupted.
The hero said, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to get back to one hundred percent of the condition. It's the best feeling I've ever felt," but the performance at the scrimage was more persuasive than the words.
The hero's playing time increased due to the delay of the joining of the starting point guard Kendrick Nan, and the way he made use of that opportunity.
The value is great because it is 15th score after playing a different role as usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his favorite hero.
"He can handler, he can score, he can defend. He can do everything for the team. He can do everything for the team. He can do any position because the way of thinking is not that of a rookie. I watch the video and research, I study it, where my teammates move and how they are free, and I'm hitting it in my head to see what I should do."
Even before the start of the season, Butler likes the strength of losing, not like a rookie of the hero, and the stoic attitude to work on basketball.
That's why I invited them to practice privately at four in the morning and trained together.
Butler once said, "He speaks his opinion to everyone, and he does not back down, and I can respect such a fighting spirit."
The Butler is the type that always says what he thinks, and if you think it will be for the team, you will be aware that there will be a collision, and you will hit a harsh opinion.
In the past, my relationship with my teammates has deteriorated.
Butler is a hero who has been a young man.
Butler’s sometimes too stern character for his teammates is a good guide for those who have the guts to come with it.
If the two teachers and pupils who respect each other, the relationship between two teachers and students who respect each other will spread to the whole team, the Heat should be able to become a team that can aim even higher.

▽4 round (Kusanagi 1st match) Hamamatsu Castle North Ko 0000000-0 410000×-5 Shimada Sho ▽Match time 1 hour 26 minutes
[Review] Shimada Sho took advantage of the opportunity at the beginning and won the Hamamatsu-jo Castle Hokuko.
Shimada sho pre-emptively hit Matsuura's two-point timely hit at first base with no-death-less bases.
He added two more points in the infield rumbling and squeezing.
In the throw, the starting pitcher Saito showed a good throw with only one hit in six innings.
Hamamatsu-jo Castle Kitako was unable to make use of the opportunity of the final two-run death base.
Three years led to four rounds.
Two years, Matsuura, a pre-emptive strike of gratitude
It was the fourth time in two years that he missed his opponent's appearance at the beginning of this summer.
Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit a changeup ball at first base and carried it to the left.
“If I lost three years, I would retire immediately. I wanted to beat myself and win.”
The talent who carried the fourth one last autumn also put his heart out.
The 1 to 3 rounds were fought in a three-year battle, and two years of strength were spent on the reserve.
Manager Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nine, “Three years have passed so far, and I will go as the best member in the future.”
On this day, four of the nine stars were the mainstay in two years.
It seems merciless, but it is proof that it is devoted to serious competition.
Matsuura is reassuring, saying, "From now on, the level of the opponent pitcher will also increase. I will face with the intention of returning the runner."
Saito, who had thrown consecutive throws, did not even step on second base with a good throw that limited six hits to one hit, and showed his ambition for three years.
The number ten is a favorable reception as a synergistic effect, saying, "I will be stimulated for three years when two years come out, if it leads to victory."
The team aiming to make it four consecutive years together with the Shizuoka tournament until last year together is not going to make the remaining games memorable.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world of singing with the people of Fukushima (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo! News
I want to deliver the cheerful singing voice of Hama, Naka, Aizu to the world - .
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gathered to create a message song.
The lyrics describe the dedication of Fukushima Prefecture in its struggle with the novel coronavirus, as it progresses toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
The "full version" will be completed by next summer, which marks the milestone of the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, by the summer of next year, by the singing voice of the citizens of the prefecture.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video posting site "YouTube".
The song is called “Pray from Fukushima.”
I put people's positive attitude on a bright and energetic melody that I want to convey from Fukushima.
Due to the impact of the new coronavirus, the live house, which is the base of music activities, was forced to close, and many musicians lost the opportunity to sing and perform.
It was planned by singer-songwriter Nappo (46) living in Minamisoma City and DAZU-O (37) of the music group Mehikari Boys, who live in Minamisoma City, to believe in the power of music because it is when the future is not visible.
Mr. Nappo wrote the lyrics and composed, and Mr. Dazuo is in charge of rapping.
When the project started in March of the coronavirus pandemic, singer-songwriter Manami (28) and Jun Kanno (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in a blink of an eye.
Mr. Nappo says with a sense of emotion, "I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a measure against infection, there was no opportunity for sixteen people to gather, and each recorded it in a live house or at home.
In order to support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew down an image character.
It is shaped like Fukushima Prefecture and expresses a rich natural climate with blue and green.
The finished song will be transmitted to the world on YouTube, and it will also be aimed at making it into a CD.
The Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, which have been postponed since the earthquake, are scheduled to be held next year, which will be held ten years after the earthquake.
Dazuo said, "What we have overcome difficulties is big, and I hope that it will encourage many people to encourage us to release songs at milestones."
The other musicians are as follows:

Instant detection of crisis outbreaks from Internet information, and hoaxes are also judged (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
“I want to know where and what disasters and accidents have occurred!”
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but also in social infrastructure companies and local governments, and many companies, such as local governments, have strong needs.
The service that responds to this is "Spectee" developed by Spectee, an AI-based information analysis company.
[Photo] Alerts from Spectty allow a professional team to determine the authenticity of social media information
Now, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is starting to shift from television to social media.
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident.
However, it is difficult for manpower to constantly watch overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
Specti has a function to detect information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc., and analyzes the contents of natural disasters and accidents, and distributes it to companies that use it after determining the authenticity of the information.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises that are occurring in Japan and overseas, and it is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises that are occurring in Japan and overseas.
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use case of Spectty, and since then, the adoption movement has spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to television stations, newspapers, and other news organizations, there are companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and more than three hundred and fifty companies in Japan, including local governments across the country, are currently using specties.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of the "crisis"
Specti distributes information by following four steps: “Information Collection,” “Analysis and Content Classification,” “Title,” and “Creally Decision-making.”
The companies that use the information should specify in advance the area (prefecture, city, ward, village, etc.) and the category of crisis (disasters, accidents, etc.) in advance.
Specti collects posts that fall under that designation using the APIs provided by social media.
Next, analyze and classify the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire truck showing a fire truck, black smoke rising from the building, and an orange flame coming out of the room, it is classified as a “fire”.
In addition, if the image of the overturned car is "traffic accident", if the image of the road covered with water is classified as "road flooded".
Specti also makes estimates of the location of disasters and accidents.
"I often don't know where the post is, so I'm contemplating it by combining various information," Murakami says.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, it extracts the information of the place name from it and compares it with the place name database to identify the location.
Angels lose opener in opening game... Ohtani hits five, hits five, hits three-run homer in the first and ninth innings (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
○ Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <Oakland Coliseum on July 24 local time> Shohei Ohtani (26) of the Angels made a start in the opening match against the Athletics held at the enemy ground on the 24th (Japan time 25th).
In the first inning, he hit a hit in the middle of the season, but in the subsequent four innings, he was out of the lineup and was a record of five hits, one hit, one strikeout.
Ohtani played against Montana again with one out in the third inning, one-out first base.
In the third inning of the fifth inning, which he picked up at 1-1, he faced his second right-hander, Pettit, at first base with one out in the first inning, and he also fell to the ground running.
The eighth inning, which he picked up with a 2-1 and one-point lead, faced Deikman, the fifth-inning left-hander as the leading hitter.
I played the straight of the second ball backwards at a good angle, but it was not over the fence and fell to the left flight.
The Angels took a one-point lead in the bottom of the eighth inning, with the relief right-hander batry losing two points and allowing them to reverse, but Castro, the seventh and new catcher, took the right-wing solo shot to the right-field seats, which will be the team's first this season.
They trailed 3-3 at the last minute.
After that, two deaths, one second base, and the batting order was second and trout.
The athletics bench shunned the trout here and opted for Otani at second base.
It was Otani who was expected to win, but three-ball three-strikes in front of the Athletics guardian deity Hendrix.
The game was not settled in nine innings, and he entered an extended game starting at second base without death this season.
Otani was the last hitter in the ninth inning, so he was a two-run double to second base.
The Angels pitched in the 10th inning, with Walsh hitting a painful first base rumble, but Olson, a first baseman who caught this hit, sent a ball to third base.
Otani, who was caught between second and third base, was a touchout.
The Angels then went on to second base, but in the end Simmons fell to two in the eighth.
On the back of that, Robes, who continued to throw in the inning, pinched two and third base with a dead ball and a strikeout.
The new manager, Maddon, made a shift to make Uchino five, but Robles walked the fourth and Davis in the fourth with four balls and filled the base.
Milner, the left-hander who replaced him, was carried to the right-wing seat with a good-bye to Olson in the fifth, and the game was decided.

"Words I thought it was not a dialect" ( ねとらぼ ) - Yahoo! News
It is a Chiba Prefecture citizen near Tokyo.
Thirty years after I was born, I have lived in the same prefecture.
When I used it in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), which means "side-down", I was called "Kyoton" for a moment.
The meaning was understood by the flow and the sense of language, but the people of Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture told me that they would not use it.
―― Certainly, “Is it a shambles → cheat and slipped in?”
As it turns out, I can guess what it means.
Then, one more thing.
This was not pointed out and noticed, but the expression “Uchinchi” which means “my home” is not used at all even if you read books, and it was a dialect when you investigated it as an adult, thinking that you should not hear it from your friends.
― eh, “Uchinchi” was ... ... was it so?

Japan's "Cold Chinese" is not a Chinese ... ?
"Cold noodle dish" unpopular reason (modern business) - Yahoo! News
"Japanese-style cold noodles" is "Japanese-style cold noodles" in China
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese cuisine originated in Japan, which originated in Japan, and was invented based on the Chinese "Lyang Bang Mien" (Chilled mixed soba).
Therefore, it does not exist in China originally, but due to the diversification of food, it began to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, at Japanese convenience stores, there are also arranged products such as "Japanese-style soba cool side / soba cold Chinese" and "Kawaka chicken Koryomen / Sichuan wind chicken cold Chinese".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China is generally not high, driven by popular Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it is not bad, but if the impact is poor, it tends to be criticized harshly.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor existence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese in China is "Nikshiki cold noodles".
The Chinese are recognized as one of the Japanese cuisines.
The standard summer is "Ryampi"
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is “Lyampi”.
In Japan, many people are not familiar with it, but Ryosame is a flat noodles made with flour, rice flour, starch, etc., which originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of two thousand years.
It is a classic of B-class gourmets sold at stalls, and the price is around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen), and it is very reasonable.
The word "cool" is included, but it is not covered with ice like cold Chinese in Japan.
Warmth is more basic.
On top of the noodles, add condiment such as coriander, chili pepper, ginger, garlic, and other ingredients topped with your favorite ingredients, such as chopped cucumbers, carrots, and boiled bean sprouts.
Finally, a special seasoning is used to mix soy sauce, lar oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc.
The noodles are well-rounded and prickly, with a refreshing and rich spicy sauce with a refreshing acidity, and even when you have no appetite for summer, you will get into it.
In addition, since it has penetrated throughout China, various toppings and seasonings exist, and the variety is abundant, which is one of the characteristics of cool skin and is one of the ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of "cold water shower" bring to the body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Reduces inflammation such as muscle pain
A study of the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water-based therapy) published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences found that it can be expected to have an effect on physical and mental healing.
By taking cold water after exercise, it is possible to suppress muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute, who teaches at the University of Connecticut and teaches at the University of Connecticut, “It is important to exercise and take a cold water shower without spending as much time as possible. After moving your body, you can quickly lower your body temperature and reduce your body temperature, which will help you recover from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise faster.”
Reduces fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"When exercising, the heart rate increases because the heart rate is high, which increases blood flow to the heart, and muscle blood flow increases because it requires energy to contract the muscle. In addition, a lot of blood flows in the skin to regulate body temperature," says Professor Kasa.
“Dy-skin showering a cold water shower reduces the temperature of the skin, which reduces the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, so water and nutrition are easier to ingest after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise.”
Expected for the hormesis effect
Drozesky also explains that the "holmesis effect" can be expected to be activated by being exposed to cold water.
The holmysis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances and stress for the body than to have no substance or stress at all.
“Low oxygen, petit fasting, and cold water showers are prime examples of hormesis effects for health. Taking a cold water shower stimulates hormones and neurotransmitters, and can increase physical and physical resilience and resilience.”

Hanshin, Oyama, two consecutive shots!
Director Yano "Looking and Style" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Se League, Chunichi 2-5Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin four wins and three losses, 24th, Nagoya D) 4th momentum does not stop.
The ball that soared high hits to the middle dan of the left seat.
Oyama released two consecutive arches and circled the diamond.
When I returned to the bench, I saw his white teeth.
"I was able to swing well, and I was able to narrow down the target ball and swing boldly."
He struck out 0-2 four times in the lead.
He actively swings from the first ball, and the second ball after a foul.
I didn't miss the 134km slider that I entered with Ohno Yu's sweet.
The hit ball caught at the core is perfect enough to be convinced of stand-in at the moment of hitting.
Two games in a row following the match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day, was a responsive counterattack.
It was also a valuable book that I hit from the opponent I was not good at.
When he played against Ohno at Koshien on the 17th, he scored four runs in nine innings.
However, in the Nagoya Dome, he allowed seven wins, one loss and one hold in twelve games in the past, and he suffered from seven consecutive defeats through a draw from August 23rd.
From such a difficult enemy, he took away the score that became the 23rd inning in the Nagoya Dome (counting one inning in the middle also counted in one inning) in a dynamic one shot, and did not pass the flow of the game.
Director Yano also said, "The level is high that you can firmly finish the sweet ball. There is a high level of feeling to watch, and there is an atmosphere even if the timing of hitting is a foul. I think that you will still hit it" and I expected further explosions.
Leave the right forehand hit at one time, and this marks the six consecutive hits and three consecutive multi-hits.
The opening was a modest start, but seven home runs and 16 hits have already worked impeccably as the top and fourth on the team.
For the sake of victory, we will continue to leave the result from now on.

Kenjin Iwabuchi, head coach of the rugby sevens men's team in Japan, told reporters online on the 25th that he was determined to "unite and work together to win the medal of the target" for the Tokyo Olympics, which have been postponed to next year.

"Health care workers" infected Nagano Prefecture's first woman in her 40s at Suwa Red Cross Hospital To conduct PCR tests on all contacts (NBS Nagano Broadcasting System) - Yahoo! News
It was found that a woman in her 40s in Suwa City, Nagano Prefecture, was infected with the new coronavirus.
It is the first infection of a health care worker in the Suwa Red Cross Hospital.

Macau casino superintendent observes the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities ... required to present a new coronavirus negative certificate at the time of entry (Macau Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There are about 40 casino facilities in Macau that were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and since the 20th of the same month, they have resumed operations after taking strict epidemic prevention measures.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires the operating companies to protect the health of employees and guests as much as possible when reopening, and ensure the distance between gaming (casino) tables, vacating the next seat in table games (for example, three to four people can be seated at the table at the same time at the Baccarat table), and slot machines are also set to operate every other day, and the risk of cross-infection is reduced.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
In addition, guests are required to wear a mask, measure their temperature, and present an effective health code (the most recent stay history, whether they have contact with the new coronavirus patient, whether they have symptoms such as fever or cough, and those that are generated by entering the contact information) at the time of entry.
From midnight on July 15th, the presentation of a negative certificate of new coronavirus nucleic acid test (limited to those within the validity period issued by the authorized facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was also added to the condition.
The reason why the presentation of a new negative certificate is mandatory is the relaxation of border measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6am on the 15th (the elimination of quarantine for fourteen days, there are conditions), and it will be a precautionary measure accompanying this.
On July 18th, DICJ announced that in response to the change in entry conditions from the 15th of the same month, the director of the bureau, Adriano Ho, and others visited the casino facility to observe the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at the casino facility, and held a meeting with representatives of the security departments of the six casinos operating companies, held a meeting to thoroughly manage the admission of guests, and asked again to protect the health of employees and guests.
DICJ will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities in the future, and will have regular meetings with the operating companies according to the situation and evaluation, and indicated that it will adjust the epidemic prevention measures at casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the government health department.
Mr. Hayashimatsu, director of the Center for Disease Supervision and Prevention of the Health Bureau, accompanied him on the site to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and how to secure the distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
In addition, due to a sharp decrease in inbound tourists due to epidemic prevention measures including entry restrictions, casino sales for the January-June period of this year decreased by 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 337.2 billion Macau Pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: about 451 billion yen).
A cheer of light from Yuwaku Onsen Next month, a message to medical workers in place of the Bonbori Festival (Hokukoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual "Yuwaku Bonbori Festival" has been canceled due to the influence of the new coronavirus, efforts to make Bonbori with messages of support for medical workers will start from August 1st.
The paper written by fans and local residents across the country is bonbonned on about three hundred and fifty, and the city of the hot spring is wrapped in the light of the ale, and healing is delivered to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that reproduces the festival that appears in the anime "Bana Blooming Iroha" modeled on Yuwaku Onsen, and is sponsored by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It began in 2011, when the anime was broadcast, and every year, many anime fans from all over the country visit.
Every year, every day from the lighting ceremony in July to the October of the main festival, the bonboro is raised on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to the Soyuyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be canceled due to the new corona, but fans from the local people and all over the country said, "I will miss the summer of Yuwaku", and the association proposed this project.
He named it “Recovery Campaign” because he wants to help the healing and recovery of the world, which is in trouble due to the coronavirus pandemic, as much as possible.
So far, about fifty students in Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibaharanaka have been asked to write messages with illustrations one by one, and more than a hundred applications have been submitted from all over the country.
The message form is purchased from the Association's website, and after filling it out, you can send it to the association in a reply envelope, and you can receive a photo with the light on it by sticking it on the paper.
Applications are accepted until a set of six thousand yen is reached, and the total of bonbonbori is reached.
The lights are scheduled to be on until the end of November.
Shinichiro Yamashita, 48, who is the executive committee of the festival from the first time, said, "Reading the message will encourage us, and we want to hold the 10th festival next year at a grand scale."
For the campaign, we also prepared illustrations of the flower-flowered Iroha character and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge.
From the first day, we will give clear files with illustrations to users of the special accommodation plan of the inn of Yuwaku Onsen.
Seibu's core four "Moriyama Gaigen" supports soul cooperation (Higashi Spo Web) - Yahoo! News
Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gaigen" showed the cooperation of the soul and produced a farewell victory for the second time this season.
The 24th game against Lotte (metlife) was two-two in nine times, and the four who are still far from the main condition showed their obsession for victory.
Genda, the leading, took the lead from the safety bunt to first base with a head sliding to first base.
Then, in the last six games, Mori, who is at the bottom of the bottom, decided to send a bunt and hit one death and two bases.
Yamakawa, ranked 4th, was shunned to declare, and Sotozaki, who returned to the 5th position to replace Mori from this day, smashed Masuda's direct ball and led to a 3-2 victory.
The hero, Tonozaki, said, “ (Genda’s safety) was surprised even on the bench, and I thought that I had to do something about it. I felt that Tomoya also believed in me behind me with a bunt and connected me. Yamakawa-san gave me a word saying 'Go actively!' before going to first base with Keien, so I was able to get in, so I was able to get in the feeling of goodbye."
Mori, Yamakawa, who was drafted in the 13th year, Mori, Yamakawa, who was third in the 14th year, and Genda, who was third in the 16th year, and Genda, who was third in the 16th year, were the four of the fielders who are referred to as "the heart of our current home" by the baseball team.
Both have experience as captains in the amateur era, and the sense of responsibility is more than double.
Sotozaki, who took over the captain from Yamakawa when he was four years old at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa-san is a captain who leads the team with words because he is good at speaking anyway. On the contrary, I was the type who left the talking to the good vice captain of the speaker and set up behind him." Each of them supports the forest of the new captain Genda and the new player chairman while demonstrating their own individuality.
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But I thought, 'I can go well' with that. Tomoya was also a wonderful bunt. Sotozaki also hit me well." The soul of "Moriyama Gaigen" is the cooperation of the soul of "Moriyama Gaigen".
All four are now suffering from a two-fifths batting average of four to five minutes, but even if they don’t hit, they support the team with the wisdom of winning.

Coronavirus "Art familiarity" Online museum "HASARD" launched by Mr. Konno (from Hachinohe) (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can touch art for free whenever they want.
He has a wide range of works, from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since the opening of the online museum "HASARD" in April, it has captured the hearts of users from its convenience and newness, and the attention has been further increased by the new lifestyle due to the corona disaster.
Shinnosuke Konno, 26, who was born in Hachinohe City, who founded the site, said, "I wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art. I want people to experience art in the midst of difficult situations."
When I visited Azor, I was surprised by the abundance of the exhibition and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of fourteen exhibitions and exhibitions of permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions have been released, and ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush attract the viewer.
There is no need to register as a member or admission, and not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition is not expensive.
The online way of showing is also attracting attention.
Moving the painting is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Begins to Move Again", it is digitally processed so that clouds, flowers, grasslands, etc. move.
"I want to be able to enter even people with low interest in art" (Konno representative), so you can feel like you are in a picture.
I met Konno and art when I was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by the power of Marc Chagall's three huge paintings of "Aleko".
From the next day, the art class changed to a fun time, and after I went to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, I started to visit galleries and so on.
At the same time, I felt that there are many people who do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there are no museums nearby, and only large exhibitions are held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working at an IT company, I spent about two months setting up a site where I could appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of ten thousand per month in the first ten months, and after the spread of the new coronavirus infection, it increased to about thirty thousand.
If anyone can see art when they want to see it, they can appreciate art in a free way.
Azor's aim was unintentionally accepted by more people due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr. Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation enriches the imagination.
“When you have a rich imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I hope that by becoming closer to art, we will become a better society."
The Simple Reason for the End of the Chinese Quality Era and the Era of Japanese Quality Coming (Modern Business) - Yahoo! News
Shifting values with the pandemic
There are various predictions and discussions about the after-pandemic world.
On the business side, the article of July 8th "In fact, the work of "managerial management" is beginning to disappear in Japan ...! The cruel reality" and the article of July 4th "In the world of "post-coronavirus", in fact, "Japanese manufacturing industry" is likely to be a big comeback ... There is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the "" etc. will occur.
[Photo] The identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people do not know ... An unexpected reality seen in Asia
In terms of spirit, the flow of the June 26th article "The knowledge of complete combustion to those who have become aware of the end of life due to corona" and the article on June 10th "Let's review the utility of "God's request in times of hardship" now full of corona and riots" will become mainstream.
The major flow from Chinese quality to Japanese quality is that it seems that the two “materials (economics and business)” and “spirit” will be clearly visible to our eyes as a combined form.
For example, if there is a defect or defect in a T-shirt or digital camera, it is infuriating, but there is no separate article in the life of the person who bought it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic, is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you cannot buy such a product.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will be looking for "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not happening only in Japan.
It is clear that Western countries, which have been in a difficult situation due to the shortage of masks and medical equipment, have returned them one after another due to the terribleness of "Chinese quality".
Safer and safer than cheap
In addition, products such as automobiles can be fatal (deaths due to accidents) due to defects.
No matter how much China and other countries go on the offensive in the low-selling strategy of "Let's be cheap and bad", in the end, it will not be able to compete with Japanese products in the case of June 16th, as stated in the article "Do the world's automobile manufacturers bow down to Toyota?" because the product of automobiles is strongly required "Japanese quality" is strongly required.
And this pandemic reminded us that many other products also need to be “safe and secure.”
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services".
Like the toilet paper riot, even though the production capacity is right, the intermediate distribution may not reach you due to the delay.
In addition, as in the article "Who is the real culprit of the shortage of masks! Don't forgive the fire place thief of the Chinese Communist Party government" on April 17th, I was keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is an important element of "safety and security".
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for any country to prioritize their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical equipment) and food in your own country.
South Korea's new coronavirus cases surpass 100 for first time in 115 days = 86 overseas inflows highest (Yonhap News) - Yahoo! News
NEW YORK (Reuters) - South Korea's central anti-epidemic task force said on Tuesday that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus as of midnight on the same day had increased from 113 as of midnight on the previous day, bringing the total to 14,4092.
The number of new infections per day exceeded 100 for the first time in 115 days since April 1 (101 people).
Thirty-two Russian sailors who entered the port of Busan were found to be infected, and thirty-two of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.
The number of new infections in South Korea was 30 to 60, with the exception of 20 days (26 people).

Nagoya · Miyahara player positive for corona soccer J1, the first after the resumption of the league|SHIZUOKA SHIMBUN AT S
Soccer J1's Nagoya announced on the 25th that DF Kazuya Miyahara (24) has tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first time that a player has tested positive since the resumption of the J-League.
He is the third player from the club, following FW Yumeo Kanesaki (31), who was infected in June, and GK Mitchell Langerak (31) from Australia.
Both have already been treated and are back in the game.
Miyahara was benched on the 22nd at the J1 Oita match at the Showa Denko Dome Oita.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th, revealing that 60 players, staff and others were given PCR tests on the same day.

It turns out that the white paint derived from the frying pan of Teflon processing, the insulation enhances the cooling effect!
A true discovery!
This year was the rainy season, with an unusual amount of rainfall, which was conspicuous, but if it is clear, the hot summer will be in full swing.
It's hot and hot, and the scorching days are so hot that even the air conditioning is not effective ... just imagine it already, it's almost likely to be swell, isn't it?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been working hard to figure out how to overcome the hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear light white clothing.
You don’t have to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And it seems that the number of cases using white paint is increasing by applying the same principle to the architecture of the house.
White is a white color, but it is also the latest research field, which can not be used as a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the United States, in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University's Faculty of Applied Physics and Applied Numbers, announced that it has found a way to blend white paint that can play back solar heat most efficiently and improve the cooling effect inside the building.
It is expected that early practical use will be aimed at.
Until now, white paint, which has the highest reflectivity of sunlight, has been made of titanium oxide, which has a reflectance of 85%.
White paint that already uses titanium dioxide is applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and is used to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from the fluoropolymers of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that is used in the Teflon-processed frying pan.
This white paint, which applies the Teflon effect, reflects the sun's rays to nearly ninety-eight percent, making it possible to cut the heat significantly.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon unexpectedly, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to extreme heat.
Maybe that time is coming, right?
I feel that the roof of a Japanese house has a lot of dark colors, but from now on, white will become the mainstream?
Amazon's annual big sale, when will this year's event be held?
Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual “Prime Day” sale, CNBC reported on July 21st.
It is held every July, but this year it was said that it was postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
A spokeswoman said in a statement that the company would be announced in a statement.
“Prime Day has become a special celebration that we’ve been looking forward to for over the past five years. This year, we’re holding it at a slower time than usual, while ensuring employee safety and supporting customers and exhibitors.”
However, he said, “Details will be announced soon,” and did not specify a specific date.
On the other hand, we decided to hold a meeting in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it would be carried out for 48 hours from midnight on August 6.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year it may take unusual measures.
Amazon started a large-scale sale for its members last year as a way to promote sales in the summer when sales are declining.
It was originally a 24-hour event, but it expanded in size year by year, and last year it was held in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia, with 48 hours from midnight on July 15.
According to the company, last year, sales for two days exceeded the previous sales of "Black Friday" (the first day of the year-end sales campaign) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
This event also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers of paid members "Prime", and last year, the number of applications on the first day was the highest on record as a daily number, and the next day there were the number of applications for the first day.
It also said it sold 175 million items worldwide last year.
Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that the world's total sales for two days increased by seventy percent year-on-year to $7160m.
Mobile number transfer, severe eyes to excessive hold.
What about fees and points?
(NEW SWITCH) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in full swing to review the MNP system, which allows the conventional telephone number to be used as it is when changing mobile communication companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, the policy was to revise the guidelines for MNP, which were established in 2004.
Specific issues include the nature of MNP fees and the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
While telecommunications companies are expected to face a backlash, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
The darkness of telecommunications companies where unlimited mobile phones is far from unlimited transfer of mobile phones The fee for users was 2000yen at the time of the introduction of MNP, but now it is 3000yen.
MNP commission revenue of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated to be up to 15bn yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation of MNP at the Working Group on the Verification of Competition Rules (WG), a meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
The time required for consumers to issue MNP reservation numbers when moving to other telecommunications companies was also listed as well.
Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of operation of the core system, the reception time is mainly from 9th to 20th.
In the WG materials, it was clearly stated that the principle of all-day measures will be taken as a direction for future consideration.
For those who wish to move in MNP, mobile communication companies are also concerned by trying to retain points by granting points.
Excessive retention could hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner of Nomura Research Institute, which is a member of the WG, recommends that "it is important to thoroughly implement this process first, thoroughly implement this process."
However, in a series of points of discussion, the structural problem of MNP fees, such as “the higher the price, the harder it is for customers to outflow, so it is difficult to actively motivate them to lower it” (the person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) is concerned.
If there are companies that take the lead in lowering MNP fees, there will be an increase in customer outflows from the company, and there is concern that corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications also pointed out that many countries overseas do not ask for user-based fees for MNPs, and there is a possibility that this will happen in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications wants to compile the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then start the procedure for amending the MNP guidelines.
The time when the amendment is to be implemented is expected to be after the 21st year.
Mobile phone companies are likely to be troubled, including sales and customer support.

In the match against Fukudome, which I received here, I drove in with two balls, and finally a fork.
In a three-ball game, he took a three-strike swing and overcame the pinch.
Katsuno struck out six innings and was 83rd innings, but at the end of the midfield game, Yoda came out on the bench and announced a change of pitchers.
Isamu Nishi, who played a pitching battle, was 108balls at the same time, but he was not able to get the right to win for the first time this season because he got off the mound first.

The name was changed to "Sunny Megumi Okayama Brand", and a new system was established to honor excellent products.
I tried to strengthen the PR.
The certification was started in FY2004 with the aim of developing sales channels for small-scale businesses.
It was renewed after 15 years had passed.
In March of this year, we reviewed products recommended by each Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and certified twenty-two items such as local sake and hats handmade by craftsmen.
The store offers a variety of products, including sweets, seasonings, and cosmetics that have been inherited from the old brand.
We will continue to recruit in the future.
Products with particularly excellent quality are awarded as the "Best Selection Award".
This time, I gave it to Hiruzen Jersey Yogurt of Hiruzen Dairy Farming Cooperative (Maniwa City).
Asahi Tex (Bizen City) selected "Kakioko canned food" as the "Challenge Award" for new products.

Masuda Shrine, located in the Takagushi area of Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu City, celebrates the death of police officer Keitaro Masuda (1869-95), who was committed to the fight against the epidemic that spread to the region 125 years ago.
The annual festival has been held in late July every year, but this year it was canceled due to the influence of the new coronavirus.
On the 26th, the self-governing presidents and others perform only Shinto rituals.
The annual festival was held by a self-governing association, and a parade of sergeant Masuda's floats on a white horse and fireworks were launched.
Nearly two hundred people, including bereaved families, police officials, and local residents living in Kumamoto Prefecture, attend the ceremony every year.
This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the media has received more inquiries about coverage, and Ryotoku Takeda, 72, the chairman of the self-governing government, says, "It is crowded every year at the annual festival that has been connected to the community. I am very sorry for the cancellation."
The prefectural police also canceled a memorial service visited by police school students this year.
On the 21st, Yumiko Sugiuchi, the head of the headquarters, and Hiroto Fukushima, the chief of the Karatsu Police Station, visited Komatsujima, which was located off the coast of Takagushi Port, attached to Dabi, and offered flowers to the monument.
"The spirit of bravery and dedication is the origin of the police, and I want to inherit it as the way it should be," said Mr. Sugiuchi.
Officer Masuda, who was born in Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895.
He took measures to prevent insomnia, such as disinfecting the patient's house, and then he himself was infected with cholera.
He said, "I will carry all the high-kushitsu cholera on my back," and died at the age of twenty-five on the fourth day after arriving.

On the 25th, a "health hot spring seminar" (sponsored by Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa of glasses) was held at the Yonezawa Saga Main Store in the glasses of Shimoda Town, Saga City, where experts advise on various health-related concerns.
Dr. Akio Kinoshita, Director of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained about eye diseases that are deeply related to daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "disease of tears", and the quality of tears is broken, and tears do not spread evenly on the surface of the eyes.
Mr. Kinoshita said, “Contact lens users are about four times more likely to be used,” and urged caution, “Do not use it for a long time or do not sleep while wearing it.”
Measures were taken, such as placing the computer screen below the height of the eyes and humidifying in rooms with air conditioning.
He also introduced ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eye.
"Omega-3s, which are contained in blue fish, prevent the evaporation of tears, and 'mucins,' which are often found in natto and okra, improve the quality of tears," he said.
For cataract surgery, there are monofocal and multifocal intraocular lenses inserted instead of the lens, and I touched on the differences in appearance.
About 40 people attended the seminar.
As a measure to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, it was divided into two parts, morning and afternoon, and it was held in small groups in two parts, and temperature measurement and disinfection before admission, and sufficient ventilation of the venue were carried out.

Director Miyamoto "Scoring power stands out" (Sports Bulletin) - Yahoo! News
G Osaka's manager Tsuneyuki Miyamoto (43) responded to the interview before the Kobe match (26th · Noesta) facing four consecutive victories on the 25th, and revealed his expectations for high school third-year high school FW Shoji Karayama (17), who joined the top team for the first time in the previous section.
The commander made Karayama, who was promoted to the top in this season's jump class, as a bench member in the 22nd and Hiroshima battles on the 22nd.
I did not give him a chance to participate, but in J3 so far, the striker who has scored three goals in five games this season in J3 said, "There is a prominent part against the fact that I score points. I want to do more and more gumshala. I have seen players who go abroad at a young age, but I want them to play with high consciousness and greed."
Karayama has eight goals in ten games for J3, where he competed as a specially designated player last season.
He is slender at 178cm and 65kg, but he boasts a staggering scoring rate of 11goals in 15 games and 11 goals in 15 games, with his sense of taking the back of the defender with instantaneous movement, and the calmness of the shots to be shown in front of the dense opponent's goal.
In the Hiroshima match, FW Ademison and MF Onose were off the bench due to injury, and Karayama got a chance, but there was no opportunity to participate.
Director Miyamoto explained the state of Ademison and Onose in preparation for the Kobe match, "Both of them are not one hundred percent, but they are eager to prepare."
If they save the two, there is a possibility that they will be benched in Karayama again.
At G Osaka, MF Doan = current PSV = made his J1 debut at the age of sixteen and eleven months, and FW Usami made his J1 debut at the age of seventeen and 0 months, and moved overseas in his teens.
Karayama, who is now seventeen years and ten months old, is expected to make his J1 debut as a follower of them.
A Ferrari stolen twenty-six years ago is found at the bottom of the river│To the work without restoration (octane.jp) - Yahoo! News
In 1994, there was an incident in which a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
The time had passed without the police being able to resolve it, but twenty-six years later, the Mondial was miraculously discovered.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (four photos) The trigger for the discovery was the diving training of the fire department.
On July 8th, a trained diver discovered something in the wedge shape that had slumped into the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army were dispatched, and it was Ferrari Mondial who pulled up something.
By matching the VIN number with the stolen car database, it was possible to associate this Ferrari with the 1994 incident.
The car is handed over to its legal owner, the insurance company, and then sent to the scrap trader.
The scrapper, Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, said, “There are still some parts left, but they are for art to be decorated. We have already received many requests from people who want to make tables from broken-up Mondials. We use engine blocks and glass plates.”
For the time being, we are not considering specific sales, and scrap dealers will keep it as an object-like existence.

The fourth and yamakawa are shunned for a declaration.
A senior of Fuji University was forced to walk, and the inner heart of Sotozaki was burned.
"I thought, 'Damn,' and before Mr. Yamakawa went to first base, he said, 'Go actively,' so I was very impressed."
From one ball to a straight ball with an inside angle high, the batting ball fell to the left.

He was called “The Man Who Didn’t Have It.”
He was selected as a versatile player who can protect the infield and abroad, and contributed to the world's best in the "Premier12" last November.
However, in Seibu, he had no experience of hitting goodbyes, and he was teased by Tsuji and manager Baba, who said, "I don't have it, you."
Rebounding his negative reputation, he won his second goodbye victory this season.
Director Tsuji said, "I asked the goddess of victory to ask for it today. He hit me well."
In the second round of savings, he was third with a one-game gap with SoftBank in first place.
This season, only one home run, and Tomotozaki, who has a batting rate of 252, said, "I still have to hit it. I will aim for the next one win and work as a team as a team."
Make a shot that decided the match, and it will be a trigger for recovery.

Who owns your household portfolio?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The majority of households where the wife manages the household budget.
No matter which one is managed, it seems that there are various episodes in household management that there are twists and turns.
My wife manages the household budget: Ako-san Ako-san is an araffic warema with a daughter in her third year of high school and a daughter in her first year of high school.
AA is in full control of the household budget.
Since the number of months in which the school fee is in the middle of the university entrance examination, the number of months when the school fee is in the deficit increases, so I negotiated with my husband to lower the pocket money, but I was definitely resisted.
At that time, I was told to show you what kind of income it was, so I showed the household book.
I should have listed all the expenses, but when I looked at the household book, it was not enough to make a deficit.
My husband seemed to be close to me, "I'm not enough", but Ako-san thought, "I understand, I'm not strong enough for my household management, so please manage everything."
Later, when Ako-san interviewed her husband, she said, "Although I am dissatisfied with being managed by pocket money, I really do not have the time and energy to manage various household expenses (for example, school teaching materials and PTA expenses)."
My husband manages the household budget: If B-san is a housewife, she is busy every day with her husband giving her living expenses.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, so B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband said, "The freezer is not good, but the refrigerated part is still available, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, it seems that the husband himself wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time, "I will buy a refrigerator, after all"It seems that the palm of the hand was turned over.
So, Mr. B complained to his friend that his husband was so stingy that he could not think of it.

Fireworks and the Karamon Gate illuminated by the colorful fireworks and light at a nationwide event = July 24th night, the Ichijodani Asakura clan ruins in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
On the night of July 24th, a year before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus, a nationwide fireworks event was held by the Japan Youth Congress (JC) to brighten up society as much as possible.
Although the weather was rainy in Fukui Prefecture, it was launched as scheduled at nine locations, and the summer night sky was colored.
JC has appealed to various block councils across the country to hope that Japan will be reborn as a signal to be reborn by overcoming the sense of blockage caused by the spread of infection.
It started at 8pm at 117 locations in 46 prefectures at the same time.
At the Ichijodani Asakura clan ruins in Fukui City, a total of 53 shots of 2 to 4 balls were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with haze.
The Karamon Gate and other places emerged in the dark night by the light of the fireworks, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
In the prefecture, it was also performed on the Matsubara Coast in Tsuruga City and the Mana River in Ono City.
In order to prevent infection, we did not pre-announce the launch site to avoid gathering with many onlookers.
