This is about how we get the knowledge.
the main character in the story is this woman, latalia lipchinsky.
He's a paleontologist, and he's specialized in digging up ancient corpses.
Natalia Lipczinsky: I was called a dead man.
Latif-Nasr: I found it particularly interesting because the excavation site is a tundra region of Canada, far north of the Arctic Circle.
One summer in 2006, she was at an excavation site called the Files Leafbed, which has no latitude ten degrees to the north pole.
Natalia: You might think it's boring, because you just have to carry your backpack, you're carrying a GPS, a notebook, picking up something fossil, and walking around all day.
Latif: One day, she noticed something.
Natalia: Old reddish-brown, palm-sized.
it was falling to the ground.
Latif: At first, I thought it was just a piece of wood, because in the Files Reefbed, we often found fragments of ancient plants.
but that night, i went back to camp
Natalia: Take out the loupe, and if you look a little more closely, there's no ellow.
It may be because of the state of preservation, but the more you look at it, the more it looks
It was bone.
Latif: She's been to this point over four years, and she's gone to this point over and over again, and eventually she's collected thirty pieces of the same bone, and most of them are very small.
Natalia: There aren't many, as they fit in a small plastic bag.
latiff: like a puzzle, i tried to combine pieces of debris.
it was really hard work.
Natalia: It was broken and shattered, so I tried to use sand and putty, but it didn't work.
So in the end, I used a 3D scanner.
Latif: That's amazing! Natalia: Isn't that right?
Latif: It's much easier to work on the screen.
Natalia: When it was all combined, I was a little bit impressed.
Latif: How confident were you that the assembly was the right way to build it?
Is there a possibility that it will be different if you assemble it differently? Is it actually a coco?
Natalia: No, there's no doubt about it.
Latif: What she found was a skeletal bone, a leg bone, and a shambles, and a cow and a sheep mate.
But these bones weren't supposed to be cows or sheep.
it was too big.
Natalia: It was an oversized size. It's a very large animal.
Latif: What kind of animal was it?
When she got stuck, she showed one of the bone fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and then she flashed it.
Natalia: When we cut the edges of the bone with the saw, we had a distinctive smell.
Latif: It smells like burnt meat.
It smelled the same smell that Natalia smelled when she cut her skull in the eerie an autopsy chamber, which was collagen.
Collagen plays a role in keeping the structure of the bones
As the years go by, they usually break down.
In this case, the climate of the Arctic was preserved as a natural refrigerator.
A year or two later, when Natalia joined an academic conference in Bristol, a fellow scholar named Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new treatment method called Collagen Appraisal.
Each animal has a slightly different structure of collagen, and if you know the collagen features of an unknown bone, you can compare it with the animals you already know, and you might be able to identify them.
so i sent one bone fragment of the bone, by courier.
Natalia: I wanted to track it because it was important.
Latif: He processed bone fragments compared to 37 other modern mammals
and found a matching animal.
the owner of a three and a half mile old bone that natalia excavated in the high-altitude north african arctic
It was a camel.
Natalia: I thought, "Huh?" and if it's true, it's amazing.
Latif: We tested a lot of bone fragments, and they all had the same results.
But considering the size of the bones we found, this camel was a third of the larger than it is today.
He was about 2.7m tall, weighed about a tonne.
yes, that's right.
Natalia discovered a giant Arctic camel.
When you think of camels, you think of camels that live in East and Central Asia.
The image of the postcard in your head is probably this, this is the human camel, the desert creature, this is it, living in the hot deserts of the Middle East and the Sahara Desert, in the big fists on the back, in the big fists of the back, for the long journey of the desert, on a long trip, and you step on the dunes with your big, broad feet, you step on the dunes, and you move on the dunes.
Why did such an animal reach the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
In fact, scientists have known for some time that it was not even before the discovery of Natalia, in fact, camels originated in the United States.
and that's where i was born.
It's been about forty-five million years since the camels appeared, and for almost forty million years, they were distributed only in North America, and there were about twenty, maybe more, probably more.
Latif: Did you know the difference when you put them all together?
talalia: yeah, the size of the body is different.
There were very long-necked types, similar to the giraffe's neck.
Latif: Some of them had crocodile-like faces.
Natalia: Early primitive camels were very small and about the size of a rabbit.
Latif: eh? A rabbit-sized camel?
Natalia: The early type.
you won't even see it.
Latif: I want to keep rabbits and camels.
Natalia: Yeah, it must be the best.
Latif: And then, three or seven million years ago, a herd of camels went down to South America, into llamas and alpaca, and then another kind of crossing the Bering Cross crossed the Bering Cross into Asia and Africa.
At the end of the last ice age, the North American camels went extinct.
So far, we've already found that it's not entirely possible to fully explain what was discovered so far north.
For example, in terms of temperature, it's the opposite of the Sahara Desert.
It's true that three and a half million years ago, the temperature was on average 22 degrees higher than it is today.
So there's a coniferous forest that's spread, and it might have looked like the Yukon River basin and Siberia.
But it's still going to be winter for six months, and the pond will have frozen.
some blizzards.
There would have been times when the darkness of night would last 24 hours.
then the whole thing.
How did this Saharan superstar survive the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her fellow scholars believe they have found the answer.
and that's a great answer.
What if the camels that we've been thinking about in order to adapt to places like the Sahara Desert actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if wide feet were not meant to walk on the sand, but to walk on snow like a shambles?
What if the back bumps -- I didn't know, I didn't know, but they're full of fat, not water, and they're full of fat, and if they helped me survive the half-year-old winter with little food?
What if, after a while after crossing the overpass, the characteristics of winter were used in the hot desert environment?
For example, the hump may be useful in hot weather, because if you store your whole body fat in one place like a backpack, you don't have to cover your body with fat that acts as a thermal insulation.
That way, it's easier to release the heat.
What was thought to be representative evidence of this tremendous adaptation to the desert could actually be evidence of a former high-latitude Arctic.
I'm not the first to tell you this story.
And through this story, others have been able to tell us about the wonders of evolutionary biology, and they've been able to shed light on future climate change.
But that's another reason why I like this story.
For me, this is about myself, about my worldview and how it changes.
I was educated as a historian.
What we've learned is that most of the scientists are historians.
They also try to understand the past.
It tells the story of the universe, the planets, and the history of life on Earth.
And as a historian, we start by figuring out how to develop a story.
Natalia: We're going to make a story, and we're committed to it, like the story of a desert camel.
It's a very well-made story, and the camels are perfectly adapted.
i'm in the desert all the time.
Latif: But maybe one day we'll find some little evidence.
By understanding the little things, you might be able to reassemble everything you believed in.
In this case, too, one scientist discovered a fossil like a piece of wood, and the science came up with a hypothesis that goes beyond a whole new way of thinking about why this animal is likely to appear in Dr. Seus's picture book.
My way of thinking about camels has changed.
It changed from the very specific view of the desert as an extremely specific animal that can only be adapted to a particular environment, and it just happened to be in the Sahara Desert, but it turned into an animal that could actually live anywhere, where it would actually take the world.
(Applause) This is Azzur.
Hi, Azzuri.
Come on, eat.
Azzurri usually performs at Radio City Music Hall.
i'm not joking.
Now, this Azzuri is the living proof that the story about our world is dynamic.
We have to reassemble the story and re-imagine it.
Isn't that right, Azzurri?
On the other side of a piece of bone, there's a new way of looking at the world.
Thank you very much.
Modern computers are so good that we don't even realize how bad they are.
Today, I want to talk about this problem, and this, and I want to talk about this, and that in neuroscience, we're going to talk about
The night of the frost in Harlem that night shocked me deeply.
It was when I was studying computer science and neuroscience, and I was at a bar outside Columbia University, and I was talking meaningfully about the power of holograms, which would one day replace computers, with a friend at a bar outside Columbia University.
When our conversation culminated in the climax, so his phone glowed.
And he took out his phone, and he started to turn it into a type.
And when he looked up at me with only his eyes, he said, "I'm still listening."
But of course, his gaze was dim, and the meaning of that time was lost.
And on the other side of the bar, another student had a smartphone and put it up to a group of friends.
They were swiping on their Instagram photos, and they were laughing.
I started thinking about what they were happy about, even though they were unhappy with the same technology.
And as I thought about it, I realized that the bad guys weren't digital information, it was just the display devices that separated me from my friends, and that they connected them.
They were connected around something, like the ancestors who told stories around the bonfire and developed social cognition, I think that's why this tool is there.
should be an extension of bodily functions.
On today's computers, the opposite is happening.
When you're emailing your wife, when you're composing a symphony, or when you're comforting a friend, you're doing exactly the same thing.
While bending in, I'm operating the endlessly out-of-the-box icons and menu buttons that are squarely displayed like this.
I think this is wrong, and I think we can start using more and more natural machines.
We should use machines that bring this work back into the real world.
By applying the principles of neuroscience, we should use machines that extend our perceptions, rather than limit our perceptions.
Come on, I brought a machine here.
This is Meta 2.
Let's try it out.
Now you can see yours in front of me, and you can see your own hands.
So we're going into a 3, 2, and 1 immersive hologram experience, and a very realistic hologram is in front of me, and it's in front of the headset that's already in place.
Of course, what you're seeing can be a product you're shopping for, it could be a learning material, and you can use your hands to control it and move it well.
Iron Man will be proud of you.
I'm going to show you this again soon.
(Applause) If you're thinking the same way as I do, you're probably excited to think about what you can do with this technology, and you're excited to see what you can do with these technologies.
My mother was an architect, so what naturally came to mind was to draw a design of a building in a three-dimensional space instead of a two-dimensional drawing.
My mother is now touching the images and choosing the interior of the interior.
All of this was shot through the headgear using the GoPro camera.
The following example of this is a very personal one: a Glass Brain project by Professor Adam Gazzarie of the University of California, San Francisco, with the courtesy of Professor Adam Gadsley.
As a neuroscience student, I always dreamed of learning and learning using machines that could touch and manipulate this diverse, complex brain structures.
What we're seeing now is augmented reality, but this is part of a much more important idea: an idea that digital devices are trying to expand instead of limiting their physical abilities.
Come on, let's...
I think that in the next few years, we're going to have a turning point.
All kinds of digital information starts to be expressed in the real world.
Just imagine, what does this mean for the storyteller, the painter, the brain surgeon, the interior designer, and the people here?
What we, as a social community, we need to do is imagine how we can create a new reality that extends the human experience, and we just don't make it a game of reality, and we don't mess it up with digital information.
I'm very passionate about this.
Now, I'm going to tell you a little bit
In about five years, this is not a small device, but within about five years, all of these will be like thin glasses that project a hologram.
When we pick smartphones, we don't care so much about the hardware itself, we don't really care about the basic software, but as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of creating the iOS of the mind.
It's very important to make this properly, because we might be going to spend at least as long with these systems as the interface on the Windows screen.
I don't know about you, but it's cool to live in Windows.
In order to derive the most intuitive interface out of all the possibilities, we've made neuroscience the cornerstone of design, instead of letting designers fight in the boardrooms, the debates in the boardrooms.
And the principle at the center of this is called the least-resistive neural pathway.
It's the first time that the human brain controls that iOS of the mind, constantly connecting the iOS of the human mind to the human brain.
In other words, I'm trying to build a computer that doesn't need to learn how to use it.
We're building a system that allows users to understand how to use it naturally.
Here are three of the brand-new design guidelines for the user experience that we used.
And the most important thing is that the people who use it are the OS.
A system of traditional files is complex and abstract, and even the first thing you need to do is to understand it.
It's the opposite of the least-resistive neural pathway.
But in augmented reality, if you put a hologram TED panel here and put a hologram email on the other side of your desk, your spatial memory capacity will adapt to this, and you can reach out your hand to retrieve the information.
From the Tesla car you want to buy, to the legal team, you can display anything in a hologram, from what you asked me to do before you take the stage.
all right, now your brain has learned how to extract information.
The second guiding principle of the interface is to look and touch.
When you see what your baby is interested in, what do you do first?
You're going to reach out your hand and try to touch it.
This is how natural machines work.
The visual system receives basic stimuli from the like-penetar feeling, which is a feeling that occurs deep in the body.
So by touching the work directly, you can not only control it better, but also understand it more deeply.
So we're going to look and touch.
But that alone is not enough for the experience.
Humans are primates, social creatures.
And from there, we're led by a third guide, a hologram version of the bonfire example at the beginning.
The mirror-neuron subsystems of primates show that if we can see each other's faces and hands three-dimensionally, we can work together better and work together.
I'm going to show you a video behind me, two Meta users are using the same hologram, and they're connected through this object, without being distracted by the devices.
Now, with neuroscience in mind, let's try this again.
It is our favorite "iOS of the mind" -
Let's take this headset one step further, and then we're going to put it in this place next to the desk.
I'm with you now, and at this very moment, we're connected.
My spatial memory works, and when I grab the headset and get it back, I realize that I'm an OS.
And my sense of proprioception, my sense of perceptibility, I break this headset into thousands of parts, and I touch the sensor that scans my hand.
But it's not enough to see this on your own, so now our co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call soon, Ray?
(Crying sound) Hi, Ray, how are you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I see him in three dimensions in front of me.
Have a realist like the picture
(Applause) Thank you.
My mirror neuron system suggests that this is going to replace the mobile phone soon.
Ray, how are you doing?
Okay, we're in a live conversation right now.
(Applause) Ray, I showed you the hologram brain that I saw in the video earlier.
Ladies and gentlemen, this will not only change the phone, but it will also change the way we work together.
Thank you very much.
Ray, thank you.
you're welcome.
(Applause) So this is the message I found in that bar last year, and this is the message that I found in that bar, and the future of computers is not on a flat screen.
it's in us.
(Applause) If you're going to pick just one idea today and leave it to you, it's not the making of the future, it's here and now.
So all the hundred people at Meta, the administrative staff, the management, the designers, the engineers, the administrative staff, the designers, the engineers, the people, by TED2017, will be throwing out the monitor screen and using a truly natural machine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) Thank you.
thank you.
Chris Anderson: So I'd like to ask you, there's been a lot of augmented reality demos over the past few years.
There's a sometimes debate among engineers about whether they're actually watching the actual thing on a big screen.
There were also suggestions about the field of vision, and when you wear the actual headset, you can draw a wider field of view in the demo than you can see.
Is it the actual video that you showed me?
of course it's real.
Not only that, but when I made the video that I introduced, I shot it through the lens of the GoPro camera.
Because I wanted you to have a simulated experience of the real experience that you see through the headgear.
Thanks for introducing me.
Thank you very much.
I'm from the most free, tolerant, progressive place in America, Seattle, Washington.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle family.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a university professor, and I was very grateful to the environment in which I grew up, because I was always willing to make my own decisions about how I lived.
I actually didn't follow the path my parents had envisioned.
It doesn't matter if you drop out of college or drop out when you're nineteen.
And as a professional horner, I started to go around, and it was something I had always dreamed of.
He was performing in chamber music, and he was playing around the United States, all over Europe, and for years he was working with Charlie Bird, a great jazz guitarist.
And by the end of my twenties, I was a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a good life.
My parents never complained.
and he's been supporting me for a long time.
it wasn't their ideal.
He said to his neighbors and friends, "My son is in the middle of a gap year, about ten years."
But there were only one awkward conversation about how I live, so I'm going to tell you about it.
I was twenty-seven, and I was on my way home from Barcelona, and I was just hanging out at home for Christmas, cooking with my mother in the kitchen, and we were alone.
My mother is silent and too silent.
I thought something was wrong.
and i said, mom, what are you thinking?
My mother said, "We're very worried about you."
"What do you mean?" I thought, what are you talking about now?
“Tell me to be absolutely honest — you didn’t vote Republican, did you?”
Now, the truth is, I was just a horner who wasn't so interested in politics.
I realized something, and my parents, who realized it, were a little bit confused.
I was an ardent supporter of capitalism, and I'm going to tell you how it happened.
It's because of something that I've always been interested in, and it's surprising, but it's poverty.
I remember my childhood in Seattle, the first time I saw real poverty.
My family was in the low-middle class, but of course it's not real poverty.
and it was far from that.
The first time I saw poverty and poverty was in the early '70s, when I was six or seven years old.
It was a normal, unspoken experience that you've all experienced.
It's a picture of it on National Geographic, where I'm a kid in East Africa, a flies on his face, and his belly is expanding.
It was obvious that it wouldn't help me anymore, but I couldn't do anything.
Some of you may remember the picture, not the same photo, but something similar.
It's a picture of the poverty that continues to afflict the world, and it's a picture of the world that's going to make it known to the
And the picture caught my eye, and I grew up, went to school, dropped out, went back to school, went back to school, and I had a family, and I couldn't forget it.
i wondered what happened to her.
I wondered what happened to people like that around the world.
So I started looking into it, and I wasn't in college at the time, but I was looking for answers, and I was looking for answers to the answers, and I wondered what happened to the people at the height of world
Did it get worse, did it improve, or what happened?
And then I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I'm going to tell you all about it.
Now, most Americans think that poverty has gotten worse, and that childhood would have been worse than it was in those days.
If you ask Americans if global poverty has worsened or improved, 70 percent of them will say that hunger has worsened since the early 1970s.
So let me tell you the truth.
This is the enlightenment that changed my worldview.
Between 1970 and today, the world's population of the world was starving, people living on less than a dollar a day, and of course, adjusting the inflation rate -- and those people who were living in a state of hunger -- and of course, they also reduced their share by 80 percent.
Eighty percent less poverty in the world than I was when I was a kid.
and i didn't even know that.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a miracle.
it's something to be happy about.
It's the greatest anti-poverty effort in human history, and that's what happened in our generation.
(Applause) And when I found out about this, I wondered, what made it work?
you can't reproduce it unless you know why it was made.
If we want to recreate this and lift another two billion population out of poverty, that's what I'm talking about -- from my childhood to now, two billion of our brothers and sisters, who are the "little ones" in the Bible, are out of poverty.
I want to know to save two billion more people.
So I started looking for answers.
It had nothing to do with politics in the answer. It didn't matter to me.
I'm still not interested in it.
I wanted the best answer from the mainstream economists, right, left-wing, centrist, regardless of whether they were right or that of the centrists.
let me tell you the answer.
there are five success factors.
Our brothers and sisters in the world have lifted two billion people out of poverty to this day.
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
The third is property rights.
The fourth is the rule of law.
The fifth is entrepreneurship.
Since the 1970s, the world has become a free enterprise system, and since the 1970s, the world has become a free enterprise system, and it has become possible.
But I'm not that simple, either.
We know that free companies are not perfect, and we know that there are other things besides free companies that are necessary to build a better world.
but it's amazing.
It's a problem that goes beyond politics.
what i learned, what i realized
The significance of capitalism is not limited to the accumulation of wealth.
The best aspect of capitalism is that there are aspirations, and a lot of people talk about their aspirations on this stage, in other words, ambitions that come from aspirations, which are deeply connected to the free enterprise system.
We need to spread this ambition more widely.
Now, let me tell you about the second enlightenment, which is associated with the first enlightenment, and it's about making progress not only in the world, but also in the world, but in this city that we are in now, and it's also about the world that we're in.
And this is the best way to think about poverty relief that I just talked about, and this is what I've heard, and this is what I've heard, "There's no system in human history that has created wealth like the free market.
We've lifted billions of people out of poverty."
Whose words are they?
It sounds like Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan.
no, it's not.
This is President Barack Obama.
why can't you say that?
because i was told it directly.
you can't believe it.
and what came out of my mouth was banzai!
And in addition to that, I thought, "What a wonderful opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In the middle of an event about this theme, it's Georgetown University.
I thought this was the solution to the biggest problem facing the United States.
It's about reaching out to the people who need us most, regardless of whether you're a liberal or a conservative, free market solves poverty.
You don't have to say, you know that the crisis in the United States and around the world is because of the polarization of politics.
We're in a crisis right now.
It's a disgusting situation. It's not like this.
Last year, a paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and it was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and it was the most authoritative scientific journal in the West.
In this year's paper, the theme was "political asymmetry of motivation."
And this is what it means to define a psychologist as saying that your own ideology comes from love, but the enemy's worldview is born of hate.
it's common in world conflicts.
For example, it's a phenomenon that we see between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper have discovered, in America today, Republicans and Democrats, are the majority of people, both in the Republican Party and in the Democratic Party, in terms of political asymmetry.
Today, in the United States, the majority of people who are passionate about politics believe that they are moving with love, and that their opponents are driven by hatred.
Think about it.
Most people think, "My ideology is based on very basic tolerance, I want to help people, but the others are the bad guys who are trying to trap me."
As long as there is asymmetry of these species, we can't move forward as a society.
it's impossible.
So what's the solution?
Let's start with the fact that there's a difference, and it's obvious.
It's not that simple, not to underestimate the differences.
There's a lot of good research on this.
and a veteran ted talker and friend, jonathan height
he's a professor of psychology at new york university
I study the ideologies, values, and morals of different peoples.
According to him, for example, conservatives and liberals are very different in what they care about.
For example, according to Hait, among liberals, 59% more people care about poverty than those who care about economic freedom.
Among conservatives, economic freedom is 28 percent more important than those who care about poverty.
This gap doesn't seem to be going to shrink.
you're never incompatible? it's a mistake.
This is diversity, and here's our strength.
Do you remember what saved the poor?
It was that the obsession with poverty issues spread around the world by the means of a free economy.
So if we need each other, if we want to lift the next two billion people out of poverty and help people, we need each other.
there's no other way.
now, i'm here.
How can we achieve this?
it's hard, isn't it?
we need innovative thinking.
there's a lot of them on this stage.
Social entrepreneurship — yes, absolutely sure, it's great.
Sustainable, ethical, moral, and responsible foreign investment is required.
That's absolutely true! But what do you really need?
It's a new world with flexible ideologies.
we need more surprises.
Isn't that right?
Have you ever felt that your ideology has become moldy?
Is there anything that is common?
Do you think you're just listening to people who have the same opinion as you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, there are conservatives on the right, about taxes, regulations, big government.
On the left is liberal, and when you talk about economics, it's always about income inequality.
Both are important to me and to you.
When it comes to saving people from the world of hunger and needing help today, this is a hindrance.
We should work together on the best way to alleviate poverty, and we should be able to work together on the best way to alleviate poverty, for the Conservatives, for the Conservatives, and for the liberals, for liberals, for liberals, they need to be attached to the free market.
This diversity, if we embrace it, becomes one of America's strengths.
So how can we do this together?
We need a list of activity items, not just for you, but for myself.
The first one, the first item, remember that it's not enough to just tolerate people with different opinions.
that's not enough.
We need people who don't agree with us, because there are people who are still waiting for these tools that we can deliver with our diversity.
Now, what should we do? How can we tell them?
Where does it start? Here it is.
All of us in this room, and we're blessed.
I'm blessed with people who listen to me.
They're also blessed with success and leadership.
If you talk about an unexpected ideology, they might listen to you.
maybe that's where progress starts.
that's the first one.
I want you to be, and there's a person I want to be, especially someone who can turn the boundaries into something that's blurred, and I want you to be someone who's hard to mold without either of them.
A conservative who speaks of a moral obligation to fight for the poor who always talk about poverty.
If you're a liberal, in order to solve our problems, you're going to be a liberal who's always talking about the benefits of free markets if you're using them responsibly.
and then you can do two things.
The first is that we can start the next two billion people's relief, and we can work on the solutions we need in the future, like we've seen a lot of things in the past.
Second, we can turn the war of the terrible and sacred ideological battles we are going through under this country into a race of ideas based on a sense of solidarity and respect for each other, a race of ideas based on a sense of solidarity and respect for each other.
And then maybe you realize that the big difference that we think we're thinking about is not that big in the end.
Thank you very much.
In college, I was a political major, so I had to write a lot of reports.
If a normal student writes a report, the amount of work that goes like this:
So this — at first, it's slow, but the first week, we've been good enough, and in the second half, we're in an orderly state, even if the load is a little high, we're in order.
i'd like to do it that way, too.
as a plan,
I'm going to start working on it right away, but when I actually do the reporting, it's like this, in my case, it's going to be like this.
it happens every time.
And then I had to write a ninety-page my graduation thesis, and I had to write it for a year.
I knew that the usual way of doing things didn't work.
it's too big.
So I made a plan, and I decided to do it this way.
it's a oneyear plan.
At first, it's like a gentle staircase with a light, a little bit up in the middle, a little up in the middle, and a splinter at the end.
and the way up these stairs
it's not going to be difficult.
But something strange happened.
the first few months
They came over, but they couldn't do anything.
So the plan is going to change.
And then — the middle period has passed, but I can't write, and I'm in this state.
Two more months, a month, and then two more weeks.
One morning, I woke up, I only had three days until the deadline, and I didn't have a choice, I didn't have a choice, I didn't have a choice, I was writing a 90-page paper in 72 hours, and I stayed up all night for two nights in a row, but the human body couldn't do that, but the campus ran through the campus with all my might, and the time turned into slow motion, and I submitted it at the moment of the deadline.
and i thought it was all over.
A week later, I got a call from college.
“Is that Tim Urban?”
yes.
i have a story about the papers that were submitted.
"Oh"
And he said, "I've never seen such a wonderful graduation thesis."
Oh, it didn't happen.
it was a terrible paper.
I just wanted to make sure that in an instant, everyone would think, "Isn't this guy a genius?"
it's a terrible paper.
now i'm a writer.
I'm writing a blog called "Wait But Why."
About two years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior was always confusing to people around me, so what was going on in the head of the procrastination shop, and why we were like that.
I wanted to explain to people who weren't procrastination people, and I thought there must be a difference between the procrastination brain and the brain of the non-procrastgate.
To confirm that, I decided to find and compare my brains, where I can get a reliable MRI of the brains of people who are not procrastination, and I decided to compare them.
We're bringing the results here today.
I want you to be careful to see if you can see the difference.
If you're not a brain expert, it's a difficult difference to understand, but well, just look at it.
This is the brain of a person who is not a procrastinationist.
[ Reasonable decision-making] In this case
my brain,
[Salts who want immediate rewards] This is the difference between the two.
Both brains have rational decision-makers, but in the case of procrastination, there are monkeys who want immediate rewards.
How does that affect the procrastination?
Everything is going well until this happens.
"You'd better do a little work." "No." The rational decision-maker makes the rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like it, so he takes the steering and says, "Yes, I'm going to read a Wikipedia article about Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding's case, because I remember that happened.
And then I have to go to check the refrigerator and see if anything has changed for ten minutes.
And then there's the YouTube spiral, waiting for Richard Feynman to watch a video about magnets, starting with a video about a magnet, and then I'm going to watch the interview with Justin Bieber's mom.
so for the time being, i'm full of my hands, so i'm sorry, but today is enough
i can't afford to put my job in.
What's going on?
i want the monkey to steer, not the other person.
I'm only alive in this moment.
I don't remember the past, I don't know about the future, I only care about two things: easy and fun.
In the animal world, that's not a problem.
If you're a dog, it's a very successful way to spend your time doing only the much easier and fun things to do.
For monkeys, humans are just a type of animal.
You can eat well, sleep well, and just produce the next generation, and you can still do it when you're living a primitive life, which might be good.
They're not living primitively now.
We live in a civilized society, but monkeys don't know what that is.
That's why there's another rational decision-maker in the brain, and that's why it gives us abilities that no other animal has.
and we're imagining the future
You can see the big picture.
You can make a long-term plan.
The rational decision-making processor takes into account everything.
Now I'm trying to get them to do what they have to do.
Sometimes it makes sense to do something fun and easy, like when you're having dinner, when you're sleeping, when you're in your free time.
and there's a overlap between the two
and sometimes they agree.
But sometimes it makes sense to do things that are difficult and not very fun, as a big-sized decision.
And that's when we get into conflict.
In the case of procrastination, this conflict tends to end with a certain result, and you spend a lot of time in the orange part, which makes it easy and fun to do.
I call this area the dark playground.
The dark playground is a place where all the procrastinators know well.
It's where you're going to play when you're not playing.
The fun in the dark playground is not really fun, it's not really fun, it's fun, it's full of familiar procrastination, like guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing.
The question is, in a situation where monkeys are at the helm, how procrastination can move to a place where the blue area is inferior, but where the really important things happen.
In fact, there's a guardian angel in the procrastination shop, and they're always watching over us, and they're called the panic monster, even if it's the worst time.
Panic monsters, panic monsters, most of the time, are asleep, but they wake up all of a sudden wake up when a terrible outcome, like a professional crisis, is approaching.
And the important thing is that it's the only thing monkeys fear.
And very recently, I was in the care of it, and six months ago, people at TED contacted me and asked me to give them a TED Talk.
And of course, I said, "I'll do it."
It's been a long-held dream of mine to be able to say, "I've had a TED talk before."
[I've had TED Talks] In the midst of this excitement, rational decision-maker cares about something else.
"Do you know what you took?
Do you know what's going to happen in the future?
I have to sit down and take it off!”
The monkey replies, "I totally agree, but I'm sure you can get a good idea of Google Earth, if you open Google Earth, you can expand the bottom edge of India to 60m above the ground, scroll for two and a half hours, and go up to the edge of the top, and you can get a good grasp of the image of India."
So that day I was doing it all the time.
Six months became four months, two months, a month, and TED opened up a list of speakers.
When I opened that page, I saw my face staring back.
So who's awake?
Panic monsters became frantic, and as soon as the whole system was in chaos.
Remember that monkeys are afraid of panic monsters, and they run off on a tree.
And now I'm finally able to get the rational decision-maker to steer, and I'm ready to give a talk.
The panic monster also explained the erratic behavior of the procrastinator, and I couldn't write a line at the beginning of the report for two weeks, which awakened to a miraculously intense work ethic, and I was able to write eight pages throughout the night.
This is the whole situation with three characters, the procrastinator system.
It's not pretty, but it works eventually.
That's what I decided to write on my blog two years ago.
When I wrote it, I was surprised by the response to the blog.
There were literally thousands of emails from all over the world, from a lot of different people.
Nurse, banker, painter, engineer, and so many graduate students.
And they all wrote, and they were writing together, and they said, "I'm having the same problem."
But the lightness of that blog post and the weight of the emails we received were in stark contrast.
It was written with a strong frustration at the impact that procrastination is having on their lives, and I wondered what it was like to be treated by monkeys.
And I thought, what's going on with the procrastinator system that works?
Why are they in such a dark state?
What we found is that there are two types of procrastination.
In the example I was talking about, there was a deadline.
When there are deadlines, the impact of procrastination is limited to a short period of time, and panic monsters appear.
But there's another kind of procrastination, and there's no deadline for that.
In the case of entrepreneurship, like a businessman or an artist, there's no deadline at the beginning, because nothing happens until you go out and do something and get on track and start running.
And there are a lot of things outside of work that don't have deadlines, like going to see your family, exercising, staying healthy, or building relationships that don't work out.
If the only mechanism for procrastination is to do these difficult things, then there's a problem, because in a situation where there's no deadline, there's no panic monster.
There's nothing to wake up to, and the effects of procrastination are not limited, and we're going to keep procrastinating forever.
Such long-term procrastinations, like that, compared to ridiculous, short-term, procrastination with short-term deadlines, are less visible and spoken, and usually alone, they are quietly irritating.
long-term, big-hearted misery and regrets.
I thought it could be a source, and that's why they wrote the emails, and why they were in such a horrible situation.
It's not being canned on some project.
Long-term procrastination makes you feel like a bystander to your life.
Their frustration is not that they can't make their dreams come true, but that they can't even start pursuing them.
I was reading these emails, and I was inspired by the fact that there are no people who are not procrastinationists.
they're all procrastinators.
You may be in a healthy relationship with deadlines, if not messy like I am, but be aware that monkeys' problems are the most disgusting when there are no deadlines.
And one last thing I want to show you.
it's a calendar of life.
Each box corresponds to each week in the ninety years of your life.
There's not that much, because we're already using it a lot.
I think we should all take a closer look at this calendar.
What are you really procrastinating, because everyone should be procrastinating something?
You need to be aware of the monkeys who want your reward right away.
This is a job for all of us.
Given that there aren't that many boxes, this work should be started today.
well, not right today.
if you can.
Not too far away.
Thank you very much.
At that time, I was afraid of the last moments of my life in a church in Texas that was full of soul and body.
At a very venue like this, you're sitting shallow on a broken wooden chair covered in red rags, on the left, an organ on the left, and a choir behind it, and in the back, there's a baptist tub in the back.
Nothing has changed.
The tension, the scrupulous wish for salvation, the sweaty palm, and the sitting in the back, those who seem not very interested
The night of the Second Coming of Christ, when I believed the world would end.
That year, I was exactly twelve years old, and in the holy book, I was officially recognized as a person.
And yet I wanted to complain that it was unfair that the world was ending, but it was a later festival, and I had to rethink what was going on.
Change your mind and go to church as much as you can.
I prayed so seriously that I forgot the passage of time, and God turned to my disbelief, and it was already desperate to make sure that his coming would not be sooner than planned.
And I was just thinking, "" Please save me. "" I was reading a book that was popular at the time.
I found it in a sentence one time, when fate, if one person lacks that faith, there will be more tragedies.
Anyway, the task that I was given was to control all the desires, to overcome the devil and inertia, to overcome my unbelief, to overcome my unbelief.
It's hard for a twelve-year-old, and believe it can be done.
The time is finally approaching.
23h50
Ten minutes left, the pastor gathered us in front of the altar to welcome the time when the clock's hand pointed to the fateful time with a deep prayer.
People of all denominations come together.
The choirs remain in their seats, and the butlers and their wives, so to speak, the bourgeois church members, in the front row of the altar.
As you know, in America, even at the Second Coming of Christ, there are VIP seats available.
(Applause) Right behind that VIP are the elderly, in the sleek sunshine of East Texas, in the sleek sunshine of East Texas, I think of the young people who kept working in the cotton fields, and those people who have been betrayed many times, their skin without wrinkles, which is like the earth itself, and those who have been betrayed by such expectations, with such dreams as if they could lead another life.
They are the protagonists of the lead for me.
They dedicated their entire lives to this moment, as their medieval forefathers had been waiting for the arrival of the last day, as they had been willing to live on a talk show that started at four o'clock every day.
Like my grandmother, her grandmother, went to the front of the altar, and I secretly followed her back, and I was convinced that she would always go to heaven.
I was thinking that if I could hold her hand while praying, I could go to heaven with you.
I held my hand, I closed my eyes, I listened, I prayed.
The pastor’s voice was loud.
And the prayers that respond to it become a cry, and it resonates with the church.
The melody of the keyboard is gaining its momentum.
and the heat that goes with it wraps around the church.
I'm going to hold my grandmother's hand again so that she wouldn't be left behind.
In the face of the horrors of fate, I ran into the darkness behind my eyelids.
And that voice comes down, "Amen."
it's over.
The clock's hands...
It's already past the time of destiny.
The savior didn't show up, and I looked at them, because they swam their eyes and they didn't realize the disappointment, they closed their eyes too deeply, long, they couldn't even realize the new possibilities.
I felt my chest hurt when I saw them.
They were deceived, they were the victims of the deceit, and I was one of them.
I kept praying, and I kept trying to resist temptation.
I've been to that ordeal of baptism, not once, but twice, and I believed it.
Until then, certainly.
When I got home and turned on the TV, Peter Jennings was celebrating the beginning of a new century, and the news was flowing all over the world.
And then there was a strange thought that crossed my mind, and I wondered if God would be concerned about the time difference, but he would come down again and again.
This flash was too ridiculous, and it was cruel.
But I still didn't stop believing.
And then there's a new faith, and the answer is not one.
My answer was wrong, the problem itself was wrong, and it's the belief in confronting that absurdity.
A new sun shines into the frozen, unmoved winter mountain of faith, and the snowmelt of the possibility began to flow into the unexplored landscape.
I still look back on that night when the Savior didn't come, in an instant, the moment when I knew it wasn't true, even if it wasn't a lie of the time when I believed it collapsed.
Some of the people who celebrated the two-thousand-year-old in a completely different way are here at the end of the process, just like what I followed, and I've been here since the beginning of the new century, my mother left, and I didn't have any contact with my father, and even God refused me.
I reached out my hand to grab something I could believe this time.
Eighteen-year-old Yale, I was going to enroll in Yale University, and I thought at the time that it was a great opportunity to break away from all those dark pasts that I saw in Oakcliffe, Texas, the people who had shattered, lost their dreams, and their hopes.
But one day on my winter vacation, I was lying face down on the floor of my house, my hands were tied behind my back, and the robbers were sticking guns to my head, and I finally realized that education would not save me.
Last year, I was working on my next rescue, a company called Lehman Brothers.
I'm going to rush to call home, and I'm not going to suffer with money anymore.
But even the financial center of it, it made noise in front of my eyes and collapsed, and even business was abandoned.
I'm not giving up, I'm a youth staff in Washington, and I'm reaching for my next hope, and the voices that come from Illinois are screaming loudly, "The time has come," "Change is coming to America."
But Congress was a shambles, but the state was tearing up hope, and the change became a laughable joke, and when politics came back, nothing happened, and we couldn't save it.
I was named the American Dream, and at that altar, I swore allegiance to the god of capitalism, and I kneeled down to the god of capitalism for the sake of success, wealth, and power.
And yet, at the time of the change of dates, I opened my eyes, wondering if there really was no God.
That night and I decided to face it again, not brave, but whether I would die or believe, I was left with no choice but to choose.
And then I went on to the next holly, because I knew that Harvard Business School, a good-pitching, stretched relief, didn't please it at this time.
we've got to make enough effort.
It was a very early night in Cambridge, and it was a very early night, and in the corner of the exciting party, three friends and a topic came up with, and it was a common topic for young people, which was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I said, "Let's go on a trip."
There was no decision on where to go, how to go, how to go.
But I was obsessed with Jack Kerouac's novels, and I left to find out what was going on in this country, "get out into the night and disappearing."
Of course, there were a lot of people who were against it, and most of all, it was very, very well, but anyway, I took a step forward.
In the summer of 2013, a trip of eight thousand miles began around the United States, the meadows of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans, and they did business for the lives of the people they met everywhere they went, and they lived that day.
I was more innovative than I was in the highest school of capitalism, trained.
This idea grew and turned into an NPO called MBAs Across America, and it was because of the wave that made me on the stage of TED.
How greedy our generation is for purpose and meaning.
And we realized that we need a little more support for the many entrepreneurs who are going to create jobs and change in the invisible places.
And we finally realized that, and to be honest, another important thing is that I tried to make waves, too.
There was certainly such a thing that every single social enterprise could heal and comfort the wounds of this crumbling country, and that's what many people would think, that's how many people could feel it.
But this evangelism journey led me to a new gospel, and that's why I'm here today.
About a year ago, I was at the Natural History Museum in New York, where I was at Harvard Business School, and it was a gathering of alumni at Harvard Business School.
Under the life-size replica of the whale hanging on the ceiling, we sat with the Fuunji of the times, and we celebrated the achievements of the alumni and the spirit of social contribution.
The connections that came together, and their assets were so proud of more than $500m.
If you look at what we've achieved, it's all beautiful.
But that's not the case, and two days later, I went to the Harlem area, and I was sitting in a corner of a farm that was once a vacant lot, and I was listening to a man named Tony about the children who came to that farm every day.
These are the children who live below the poverty line.
Even when they sleep, they hold their luggage in a homeless shelter so that they can't be stolen.
"Harlem Grown" To that Tony's program, named after him, comes to me, asking for a meal once a day.
After two decades of taxi drivers, Tony cut his pension and started the program.
He didn't get paid, because he was struggling with money, because he was running out of money.
He said he's going to hold on to any straw.
and i decided to become that straw.
On the way home, a dull sound sounded in the back of my chest, and I just burst into tears.
It was so ignorant that under one roof, a replica of a whale came in, and two days later, two days later, under the sky just fifty blocks north, a man was running unpaid to prepare his children's meals.
I didn't cry for inequality, I didn't cry for hunger, for my pity for the homeless child, not because of the anger at the wealth of the 1%, not the sympathy for the poverty of the 99%.
I was just upset, in the face of the fact that I was a dialysis machine in a country with kidney disease.
I realized that my story is for people who have to keep walking even if they don't have shoes, and they have to keep walking, and they've had an organization that's been overlooked until now to deliver effective aid to the affected areas of Harlem, Appalachia, and New Orleans, and my voice, and it was all the voices that were considered unschooled and innocent, and that it was all the voices that had been regarded as unschooled and innocent.
And that flash made me completely ashamed, and I remembered that Peter Jennings's New Century was deceived and deceived by the unreasonableness that was repeated over and over again.
and they were smuds.
But this time, I was a false savior, and that night, when I believed the world would end, I went around from that altar, and that suffering was the atonement for God, and that the words were all true, that the words were true.
From that world I believed in, I went on a long road, and I was at the starting point again.
The age in which we live is not an age of unbelief, but rather, we believe that we are not inferior to the past.
Brenee Brown, some of you may believe her words, probably Tony Robbins.
"The New Yorker," "Harvard Business Review"
Some of you may believe them, and most of all, right now, in a church called TED, we want to believe, and we need to believe.
We want a leader who can solve all kinds of problems.
They think that suffering is the necessary evil in the God of capitalism, and they believe that the verse of technological progress is absolute.
But when you're so afraid that what you believe will shake off from the foundation, you're so afraid that you're going to doubt one element of the foundation, the human sacrifice that happens there is going to be overlooked.
If something that you have to accept is hindering you, it's time to stop and ask questions.
Creativity, innovation, the gospel that celebrates responsibility for society, the environment, the economy, is not my domain.
In fact, I'm not trying to spread a gospel here that has some doctrine.
I'm here because of the existence of the gospel of doubt.
This gospel is not about believing, it's about asking for a new attitude, but the idea that there's not one answer.
They accept the mistakes of the past, and the question itself leaves room for the absurdity of that wrong.
This gospel of doubting suggests that everything in this place in this place may be wrong.
And that's the question, "Why?" is the Gospel.
Where is the need for people to suffer in vain until they give up the power that we were given to questioning?
Because of this belief in re-questioning, I made a decision about my work, and I made a non-profit MBAs Across America.
We've cut the staff in the organization, we've stopped hiring new ones, and we've made our business model public and shared it so that people who need it are free to use it.
The question of why asked me again was to give up the role of the savior that people had imposed on me, because our lives were too short to wait again for Christ's return in the face of the truth that there would be no miracles.
This gospel of doubt, even when it seems hopeless and does not seem to be a successor, should encourage you, give you hope, and shines beyond that, even when it's painful and painful, it doesn't drown in the thought-stopping of blind faith, and the inner voice that dares to ask questions becomes a small, subtle but irreplaceable light, and illuminates the darkness, even if it's a whisper.
Whether it's a cry, it's just a simple voice, and it's like, "There must be another way."
Thank you very much.
Food crisis
it's news on a daily basis.
What does that mean?
In the world, depending on the location, there is a shortage of food and oversupply.
On the other hand, GMOs are saving the world.
GMOs may also have problems.
Excessive agricultural wastewater is polluting the ocean, in which toxins are flowing in, and it reduces nutritional value.
and this is going on and on and on and on and on and on and
I'm very disappointed with today's discussion of the environment.
How can we solve the problem with our knowledge?
Let's look at the food problem of apples.
You probably ate an apple last week.
How long do you think the apple has been plucked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months — the average apple on the line of food stores in the United States.
I don't think there's much difference in Europe or any other country in the world.
There's a record that the apple picks, it's in the refrigerator, it's stored in the refrigerator, and it's filled with the gas for preservation, and there's a record that the worker went into this storage and died trying to get the apple, because the air that slows down the apple rot is toxic to humans.
Why did no one know about this?
Why didn't I know?
Ninety percent of the antioxidants in apples are lost by the time they eat.
This is just a lump of sugar.
Why are we so lacking in information? How can we improve?
because the platform is missing.
When I was young, I was talking about platforms, computers, and when I was young, I did very bad things
i did it on this platform.
But I was able to meet people and express myself.
How to express yourself using food?
If you have a platform, you can ask, "What if?"
My question was, what if the climate was equal for everyone?
This is the climate map of the world.
High-productivity places are shown in green, low places are shown in red.
The color moves and changes, and the agricultural center in California is now moving to Mexico.
China is growing better food on the land of Brazil, and we are subject to the climate.
What if each country had a suitable climate for production?
How will it change people’s lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem for the previous generation was getting more food cheaper.
Welcome to the world of global farms.
Humans built a huge analog farm.
The lines here are connected by cars, airplanes, railways, and so on, and so on, and so on.
It's a miracle that the food that supports a population of seven billion is being produced by a small percentage of people.
What if...
What if we could build a digital farm?
It's a digital farm that's going to spread
What if we could take this apple out and somehow digitize it, propagate it in the air as a particle, and reconstruct it in another place?
What if...
I read what was written here, and I was inspired to start this research.
The first is that Japanese agriculture has no young labor, no water, no land, no future, and when I saw this, I headed to Minamisoma, right north of Fukushima, which was affected by the earthquake.
Because the land was contaminated, the children moved to Sendai and Tokyo, and Japan already depends on imports for seventy percent of their food.
The food problem is not limited to Japan.
in the u.s., we're two percent of the population who are involved in agriculture.
No matter where you are, two percent is limited to what you can do with less.
If you look at other countries, fifty percent of Africa's population is under the age of eighteen.
Eighty percent of them don't want to be farmers.
Farming is hard work.
A small farmer's life is miserable.
and it flows into the cities.
In India, farmers don't even have access to water and electricity, and the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in the last decade.
that's a really bad story.
Where will the farmers go?
in urban areas.
Young people don't stay in their hometowns, and people move into the cities.
So how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
Introducing a new tractor!
This is the combine that I created.
Years ago, I went to a grocery store or a DIY store, and I started working.
I started making strange things, and when I tried to get the plants to dance, I connected the plants to the computer, and they all died, and it was a huge number.
and at last it didn't die.
I built something that would be one of the most intimate relationships in my life, and that was when I started to understand the language of plants.
if you want to grow bigger
They said, “Do it a lot!
No one wants to go in here, just an old electrical lab.
What do you think you can do?”
I built a farm in the MIT Media Lab with my friends, and this place has been known as a research institute for digital life, not biology.
We've produced enough food for three hundred people a month in this six-square-metre space, and I can't say that it's a large amount, but...
and there's a lot of interesting technology out there
What's the most interesting thing about it?
Beautiful white roots, dark green vegetables, and monthly moat.
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
A new retail experience?
The new grocery store?
And there's one thing I can say for sure: this is the first time we've picked something from the root in the Media Lab.
There's a salad in the bag, and there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens if you have an image processing expert, data scientist, a robot researcher, and you pick something from the roots and think, "If you use your knowledge, you can do this, let's try it out."
We're going to keep the plants here in the lab first before we take them outside, because we don't want to throw away what we've grown, and it's valuable.
My tongue has changed, and I'm going to try it first, and I don't want people to eat it until I make sure it's a decent food.
So I'm eating lettuce every day, because the pH of the lettuce is within 0.1.
"Oh, that's PH6.1., I can't eat it today."
The lettuce of the day was very sweet.
The plants are under stress, and they try to protect themselves, and there's a chemical reaction inside, so it's very sweet, and they're like, "I don't want to die."
The cry of these plants makes me taste the sweetest taste I like.
A technologist who turned to plant physiology ...
I wanted to make this experiment so that other people could do it.
I'm curious about what's going to be produced, and I've been thinking about a lab where we can deliver anywhere.
I made it first.
On the front of the media lab is my lab, and there are about thirty sensors attached to each plant.
If you know about the genome and genetic engineering, this is the so-called phenom.
it's derived from the word phenomenon.
For example, "I like Mexican strawberries" means that you actually like strawberries that grow in the climate that you like to taste.
So if you program it out, you can program the flavor, nutrients, the size, the shape, the color, the texture, the texture, the texture, the texture, the texture, using the combination of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels as a recipe.
This requires data, and we have a lot of sensors to get to know the situation, and when you think about indoor gardening plants, you're going to be very sad when you look at this, and you're like, "Why are you dying? Talk to me."
Farmers predict the growth of plants, the most amazing eye force that blooms in their late 60s and 70s.
When plants are dying, they can tell you that they're suffering from nitrogen, calcium deficient, and they need moisture.
this amazing eye force is not inherited.
This is the data that a farmer has stored in the cloud.
Follow the changes in data over time.
We correlate these data with individual plants.
These are the ones that one day, the lab broccoli is represented by an IP address.
it's a srockoli that can be given an IP address.
(Applause) If you think it's still not strange enough, click here to take a look at the plant's profile.
It's a downloadable data about the growth of plants, probably more than you can imagine, not just when you can eat it.
when you get the nutrition you need
We predict when it will taste to your liking.
Are you running too much water?
Are you taking in too much sunlight?
and we're warning you.
He talks to me, he's intelligent, he has a common language with me.
(Applause) I sometimes think of it as the number one page of the plant-based Facebook user.
And the plant's profile, and the plant starts making friends.
Consuming less amount of nitrogen, more phosphorus less potassium than other plants
It should be compatible, and for now, we're just trying to figure out the complexity of interplantic relationships.
Plants may not recognize us as friends, but there's a possibility, and that depends on what we do.
This is my current lab.
It's a little more orderly than it used to be, and I've had a little bit of experience in setting up data centers in a variety of hospitals, and I'm a little bit knowledgeable about creating a controlled environment.
And I'm experimenting with all kinds of experiments in my environment.
This method, air cultivization was developed by NASA to reduce the water that can be transported into space for the Mir space station.
Here we're giving plants what they need: water, minerals, and oxygen, just as much as they need.
The roots grow so simple, they just give what they need, and they grow beautifully like this.
It's like a plant has two hearts.
It has two hearts, so it grows four or five times faster.
It's a complete world.
Humans have advanced technology over the years, and we've developed seeds that grow in tough environments, and we've continued to do technologically, but we've now created new ways of doing things, and we're in a complete world.
we grew a variety of plants.
This tomato has not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that humans have rare, ancient seed banks?
it's a seed vault.
that's great.
Some species have been preserved alive and that no one has ever eaten.
I was the only one in the lab who ate this tomato.
The problem is that this is a tomato for sauces, and I don't know how to cook it, and I tried to eat tomato for sauce, but it's not good.
I tried to grow a lot of things using protein.
Even humans can do it, but they don't really do it.
Now, what we've learned is that the equipment is large and very expensive.
I wanted to spread it all over the world, but it became a device that cost about ten million yen.
It's hard to find someone who can make ten million yen quickly, so I decided to make a small one.
This project was actually undertaken by one of my students, an undergraduate in mechanical engineering, and Camille, an undergraduate student in mechanical engineering.
Camille, me and my friends, have experimented repeatedly throughout the summer, trying to make things cheaper, better, and anyone can make it.
and then i brought this to middle school and high school.
If you want to make fun of people, tell your child something.
I went to school and said, "Set the humidity to sixty-five percent."
The first student asked, "What's the humidity?"
And I said, "It's about the water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air. You're not stupid."
And I said, "You don't have to believe me.
you don't have to believe me.
Try to set it to 100%.”
He set it to one hundred percent, and what happens?
The water aggregates, it becomes fog, and it finally drops.
He said, "What, humidity means rain?
Why didn’t you tell me that?”
We created an input screen that looked like a game.
It's a three-dimensional view. You can log in from anywhere in the world. You can log in on your smartphone or tablet
You can operate various devices and sensors of the bots.
You can choose the recipe that other children around the world made.
If you pick a recipe and start it, you can plant a seedling.
and during growth, you can also make changes.
“Why do plants need CO2? Are they harmful? They kill people.”
and they're going to hear the words.
If you increase the CO2 level, the plant will die.
When you lower your CO2, the plants are very healthy.
When the plants are harvested, a new digital recipe is ready.
It's a process of repeating, designing, developing, and exploring.
You can download data on the new plants they've developed, and the changes are effective or vice versa.
Think of these as the core of the development process.
we're going to learn a lot.
This is the food computer that we call three weeks at school.
It's going to grow this much in three weeks.
And more importantly, this was the first time he thought, "I could be a farmer myself," and maybe he thought, "I wanted to be a farmer."
So we opened up all the data.
It's all online. Let's build a food computer at home.
it may be a little difficult, but...
It's just the beginning, but it's all in place.
and it's very important that it's easy to get.
and we're going to make it something closer.
They're farmers, electricians, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, and urban planners.
Do what you're good at on one platform.
in this lab, it's getting cramped.
This is the new facility I just started using.
There's a warehouse like this everywhere.
that's why i chose it.
We're trying to build something like this in the warehouse.
This is already real.
Please take a look.
and they already have it.
They grow green vegetables and Ebola vaccines, respectively.
One of the reasons why these plants won the Grand Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was that they were ahead in Ebola research, which is a wonderful thing.
This plant produces a protein that is resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements to lettuce
It doesn't look like lettuce at all, but that's what I'm studying.
they're different in every way.
We're still in the early chaos, and it's like, "It's our black box." "Buy me."
"No, I have some very valuable intellectual property.
He's not, he's got me."
In fact, it's just the beginning, and it's about to change society.
They're looking for more, cheaper food, and they're looking for better, more environmentally friendly food.
The fact that McDonald's published the contents of chicken nuggets, which had always been the most suspicious food, shows that they are marketing to the changing world.
So let's look at the modern world.
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers are operated in an open feminine manner.
Unlike the open genome, we're like a wiki with a little bit of climate recipe, and we can pick it up and grow it from the pull-down menu.
What does this attempt look like in the world?
Remember that the world was connected by lines?
First, install the oscillator.
Instead of sending food itself, we start sending out information about food.
It's not just my fantasy, it's already spreading in places like this.
There's a food computer, a food server, and a food data center, and we've got a food data center, and we're sharing information, and people are connected.
The future food supply is not about fighting the flaws that we have in place.
we know what the flaws are.
The future food supply is a network that connects the next billion farmers, and by providing a platform, we can raise questions and provide solutions to problems, and if...
Thank you very much.
Sometimes I feel very sad for myself as a European.
Over the past year, more than a million people have come to Europe for help, and to be honest, our response has been poor.
it's really full of contradictions.
Two-year-old Alan Kurdi mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then, more than two hundred children have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
The international agreement allows the sharing of responsibility for the acceptance of refugees, but also acquiesce to the fact that the number of refugees in small countries of Lebanon exceeds the total number of refugees in Europe as a whole.
We're deploringly about the existence of the smuggling ships, but we're making it the only way to get into exile to Europe.
We exclude people who are in the workforce who are economically and demographically in line with their needs, and we exclude them from accepting people who are in the workforce.
They're against Islamic fundamentalism, and they're advocating liberalism, but they're still using repressive policies to detain young asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and seize the property of refugees.
Don't you think it's crazy?
Why are we now taking such an inhumane response to the humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people are indifferent, or at least I don't want to believe that's why.
I think it's because politicians lack a vision, and I think it's because of the lack of visions, which I created more than fifty years ago, to adapt to the changing globalized world.
So I'd like to go back to the basics and ask two very fundamental questions that we should all be thinking about.
First, why is the current system not working?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system was created by these people just after World War II.
The original purpose is to give people a destination when the country collapses, or in the worst case, when the people are turned their backs on, and where they can live safely and with dignity until they return home.
It was built to prepare for the situation we see in Syria today.
We have pledged to accept refugees into their territories through the International Convention on the Status of Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, an international organization, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is an international agreement signed by the government of 147 countries, to accept refugees from conflict and persecution.
But today, this system is not working.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies are paving the way for safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek assimilation into their homes, and they can return to their homes.
In reality, we're almost forever stuck.
In theory, refugees are responsible for the rest of the world.
In reality, it's a geographical issue, and countries that are adjacent to the conflict zone are taking on the vast majority of the world's refugees.
The system is not working, not because the rules are crazy.
We need to rethink that because we're not applying the rules properly to fit the changing world.
So how does the current refugee system actually work?
let me explain a little bit.
But I'm not going to look at it from a top-down perspective, but from a refugee perspective.
First, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call him Amira.
She's the kind of woman who symbolizes the many people in the area.
Amira is a woman, like 25% of the world's refugees, and it's a child, and the reason why you can't go back home is because the city where you lived is like this: As you can see, the city of Amira, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic city, but now it's buried in rubble.
it's not a situation where you can go home.
But Amira doesn't have a way to resettle in a third country, because it's like a lottery, and it's only going to make it one percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family are forced to make a very difficult choice.
There are only three basic options.
the first one is to take your family into a refugee camp.
There, aid is almost as unlikely as the future of Amira and her family.
Refugee camps are desolate, barren land, many in the desert.
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear bullets at night on the border with Syria.
there are constraints on economic activity
The quality of education is not good.
And around the world, about eighty percent of the refugees in camps are like this for at least five years.
Living there is a miserable life, and maybe that's why only nine percent of Syrians actually choose this path.
Then you have the option of going to the city, like Amman and Beirut in your neighborhood.
This is the choice that 75% of Syrian refugees have chosen.
But there again, we face great challenges.
Refugees usually don't have the right to work in these urban areas.
i don't get much help.
In this case, Amira and her family are waiting for almost nothing left to live in poverty in the city after they have exhausted their savings.
The third option — Syrians are choosing this.
It's a phenomenon that we're seeing in Europe today, in which we're looking for a handful of hopes for our families, for a life-threatening, on a very dangerous journey, and we're going to other countries.
These first and most impossible choices are made by the world, and the world is turning to refugees, and there are only three choices: camps, shelter, poverty in the city, and dangerous journeys.
For refugees, this is the international refugee system.
but it's an illusion to think that this is the only way
i think there's room for a rethink.
The reason why these options are limited is because in our minds, we think that this is the only way for refugees to choose, and that's wrong.
Politicians believe that doing something for refugees is a zero-sum problem, a burden on citizens.
We tend to think of refugees as burdensome or a burden on society as a common premise.
On the other hand, there are ways for refugees to contribute to society.
What I'm saying is that there are ways for everyone to benefit while expanding the range of refugee choices, in the host country, in our communities, in our society, and in the refugees themselves.
I think the four ways I'm going to talk about it now can fundamentally change the way we think about refugees.
One of the things that all four have in common is that it's a way of using globalization, the way we use the opportunities that markets create, and it's changing our view of the refugee problem.
The first idea is to create an environment for refugees, which starts with a very basic understanding: that refugees are the same people as all of us, and we're just in an abnormal situation.
I started a survey in Uganda with a colleague at Oxford University and looked at the economic activities of refugees.
I chose Uganda not because it's the world's leading host country.
because they have a very good policy.
Unlike other host countries around the world, Uganda has given refugees economic opportunities.
They gave refugees the right to work and freedom of movement.
And that's a phenomenal result, both in the refugee and in the refugee settlements.
In the capital, Kampala, twenty-one percent of the refugees had business, they hired workers, and forty percent of those employed were citizens of the host country.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs and hiring citizens from the host country.
And there were some great examples of active personal projects, even in the refugee camps.
For example, in a refugee settlement called Nakivale, Congolese refugees are involved in a business of buying and selling digital music.
One Rwandan refugee started a project to provide young people with computer games using reusable game consoles and televisions.
In spite of the harsh environment, there's an innovative approach to this picture, which is a Congolese named Demokei.
When I arrived at the living quarters, I was almost speechless, but I wanted to be a filmmaker.
He opened a community radio station with friends and colleagues, and he's using a video camera, and now he's making videos.
We've co-produced two documentaries at the request of my team, and we're doing a little bit of success in our business.
We should use these examples to decide what we're going to do with our refugees.
We need to provide opportunities for human prosperity, not necessarily to rely on humanitarian aid.
Of course, clothing, futons, sleeping places, food, everything in an emergency is important, but we need to look beyond that.
opportunities for telecommunications, electricity, education, labor rights, access to capital and banks.
We have to provide that it's natural for us to benefit from the global economy, and it's possible for refugees, and it should be.
And the second is the idea of the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all of the world's host countries for refugees have a policy like Uganda's.
Most countries don't welcome refugees into the economy in a way like Uganda does.
But there are practical alternatives that can be adopted.
Last April, I went to Jordan, and I was with my colleague, Paul Collier, a fellow developmentist, and during my stay, I brainstormed, and I talked to the international community and the Jordanian government, in a way that was in line with Jordan's domestic development strategy.
I came up with a way to get jobs for Syrians, and I came up with an idea about the economic zone, which explores the possibility of doing refugee jobs with the Jordanian people in the host country.
There's an economic zone just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, where 83,000 refugees live, and it's the King Hussein bin Talal development zone.
The Jordanian government invested more than a million dollars to connect the area to the power grid and the road network, but two things missing are labor and internal investment.
What if refugees could work here, not trapped in a camp, feed their families, learn the skills through vocational training, and then go back to Syria?
I thought this would be beneficial for Jordan, because Jordan's development strategy as a middle-income country requires the development of domestic manufacturing.
It's also useful for refugees, but it's also about helping to rebuild Syria in the post-conflict, and it's based on the recognition that we need to protect and train refugees, which will eventually be the best human resources to rebuild Syria.
i published this idea in the political magazine foreign affairs
in the eyes of King Abdullah.
Two weeks ago, at a conference on Syria in London, there was an announcement that it would be piloted this summer.
(Applause) So the third idea I want to suggest to you is a matching system between countries and refugees, which leads to happy results like in this picture, where Syrian refugees are taking selfies with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It's not often that we ask refugees what they want to hope or where they want to go, but it's possible for everyone to get it while they're listening to them.
The concept of matching theory, developed by the economist Alvin Ross, is to determine the final combination of the parties, depending on the choice of the parties.
My colleagues, Will Jones and Alex Taiterboim, looked at how to apply this concept to refugees, and at the same time, they asked them to list where they wanted to be, and at the same time, they wanted to get the type of refugees they wanted to be, prioritized by the type of refugee population they wanted, and they brought them together.
Now, of course, the conditions for acceptance should also take into account factors such as diversity and vulnerability, but you can also think of it as a way to increase the matching rate.
The concept of matching is well used, for example, in the schools of universities for students, kidney donors and patients, and so on, in the algorithms used on dating sites.
Why don't we take this in to expand the refugee options?
It can also be used on a domestic scale, because one of the major challenges we face is to get the local community to accept refugees.
Now, for example, in my country, in the United Kingdom, I often do the ridiculous things of sending engineers to the countryside and farmers to cities.
So if you match the markets, you can match the wishes of both parties, and you can hear the needs and demands of the host from the host city and the refugees.
And the fourth idea is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and disruptions that are happening in Europe are completely averted.
It's happening because of the fundamental contradictions in European refugee regulations, which means that in order to become a refugee in Europe, you have to arrive on that dangerous journey without preparation, but why do you need to make such a journey?
In this day and age of low-cost airlines and consular services, these journeys should be completely unnecessary, but last year more than three thousand people died, on the borders of Europe and within Europe.
The simple story is that if a refugee is allowed to travel to Europe and become a refugee, it can be avoided if they are allowed to travel normally to Europe and become exiles, which is called a humanitarian visa, and you can receive a visa at the embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, and you can simply pay for your own travel and travel to Europe by ferry or plane.
One thousand euros to cross from Turkey to the Greek islands with smugglers using smugglers
Cheap flights from Bodrum to Frankfurt cost 200 euros.
There are huge benefits to freeing these options to refugees.
We don't have a lot of lives to be lost, and the refugee smuggling industry itself is up for business, and chaos is disappearing from the front lines of Europe, like the Greek islands.
What's preventing these measures is not rational, but policy.
And this idea is actually being adopted.
Brazil pioneered this approach, and more than 2,000 Syrians obtained humanitarian visas to enter Brazil, and at the same time they arrived, they gained refugee status.
All Syrians who have used this system have acquired refugee status and are officially granted refugee status.
there are precedents in history.
Between 1922 and 1942, the Nansen passport was used as an international identification document, and 45 million Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens moved through Europe to apply for asylum in other countries in Europe.
The Nansen International Refugee Office won the Nobel Peace Prize, and this realistic strategy was recognized by the world.
All four of the ideas I've just talked about are the way to increase the choice of Amira, a temporary refugee that came out at the beginning.
It's a way to expand the range of refugee options, so you don't have to limit yourself to the three impossible choices that I'm talking about, but you also benefit others.
In conclusion, we need a new vision, a vision that expands the refugee options, but understands that it doesn't have to be a burden.
The idea that refugees inevitably become a burden is wrong.
It's a humanitarian obligation, but refugees are people who are technology, talented, and motivated, and they have the power to contribute to society as long as they have the opportunity.
In the coming era, there will be no end to the world of immigrants.
What's happening in Europe is going to last for years to come.
Refugees continue to move and wander in search of their place, and we should explore ways to address this situation, and we need to explore ways to use the opportunities that globalization, markets, liquidity, etc., rather than based on the old theory of humanitarian aid and the idea of philanthropy, but on the basis of the old theory of humanitarian aid and philanthropic ideas.
I want to appeal to all of you, and to all of you, and to all of you, and I want you to wake up and face this challenge.
Thank you very much.
I've been longing for the ocean since I was a kid.
It's a wonderful place full of color and life, the home of alien-like, strange creatures.
Imagine a big shark that was controlling the food chain, or it was imagining an elegant sea turtle swimming across the reef.
I turned from a marine biologist to a photographer, so I dedicated most of my work to finding the magical place I dreamed of when I was little.
As you can see, I've been exploring the water since I was quite young.
But the first time I really went underwater was when I was about ten years old.
I still vividly remember that I swam so hard, and I tried to touch an old cannon on a shallow coral.
And finally, I grabbed it, and when I looked up, I was instantly surrounded by colorful fish, and that was the day I fell in love with the sea.
Thomas Peschak, conservation, photographer, who has lived on the planet for forty years, gave me a valuable opportunity for the National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation to explore the wonderful ocean.
I've photographed everything, from the incredibly large sharks to the pretty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
Off the cold Canadian Great Bear Rainforest, a very stinky humpback whale was present at a feeding ground just 30cm away.
I've also been in the Mozambican Strait of the Seabirds mating.
Everyone on the planet and the ocean have had an impact.
And it's getting harder and harder to find the untouched ocean that I dreamed of as a kid.
They're being cornered and threatened.
We humans have been the main captives of the planet, but I've been witnessing and photographing the effects that are gradually spreading.
I've been thinking for a long time that I'm interested in being shocked by shocking photos.
And while there are benefits to this effort, I've come back to the origins.
I thought that the best way to cause change was to appeal to love.
Maybe I'm a kind of matchmaker, and as a photographer, I had a great opportunity to reveal the whole of the animals and ecosystems that are hidden under the surface.
If you don't know about it, you can't value it, you can't defend it.
Revealing hidden images is the power of conservation photography.
I've been to hundreds of ocean waters, and there's a few that I was particularly deeply impressed.
The first time I experienced that excitement was a decade ago, off the rocky, savvy coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, a huge herd of sardines migrate northward, called the sardines, in a great migration called Sardin Run.
and there's a good reason for this.
Because the fast-moving catcher who is hungry is secretly following him at a very high rate.
In general, dolphins hunt multiple, pulling some sardines away from the herd, creating a spherical herd called bait ball.
We're going to chase the fish up to the surface of the ocean, and we're going to have this live, moving feast.
there's a shark in the back.
Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but in the sardines, they actually co-exist during the Sardin Run.
Dolphins help sharks feed efficiently.
Without dolphins, bait balls would be more dispersed, and sharks would get into the so-called Sardine donuts, and they would have no water in their mouths, and they wouldn't get anything.
Now, I'm at Sardin Run, and I've experienced some exciting moments with sharks, and I know they don't see me as bait.
But at this rough banquet, like the other fish, they bumped and hit with fins.
Moving east from the coast of Africa, and across the vast Indian Ocean, you reach the Maldives Islands, which are made of coral.
During the intense southwest monsoon season, the onit makiei comes from all over the islands to a very small part of the Baa Atoll, called Hanifal, which is usually smaller than human eyes, and a large number of crustaceans are the staples of the onito makie.
If there's a plankton's unevenness, the onito mae is feeding on its own, and then it's going to be somersaults on the back again and again, and it looks like a puppy chasing her tail.
But when plankton are concentrated in one place, the rays are in series, creating a long chain for feeding, and if the ray near the front misses a little plankton, it will inevitably swallow the subsequent rays.
As the amount of plankton increases, the rays swim closer to each other, and this unique behavior is called the Cyclone Feeding.
As they swirl in a solid formation, they become cylindrical columns, and they build plankton in a vortex, collect them, and they're inhaling them, and they carry it into their own cave-like mouths.
The experience of diving surrounded by a group of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first shot Hanifar, it was not protected and threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my photos helped Hanifal become a marine protected area.
Fishermen on the neighboring islands used to catch rays to make traditional drums with ray skins.
Today, they're more engaged in conservation work than anyone else, and thanks to Ray, they're making eight million dollars more each year in the Maldives.
I always wanted to go back to the past, and I wanted to go to an era where the map was almost empty or written, "Here's a dragon."
The closest I've been to the ocean of those eras was the atolls on the western side of the Indian Ocean.
When you dive into a sea like this far away from the marine lanes and the fishing fleet, you can feel the state of the ocean in the past.
Most people have never heard of Basus da India, a small reef in the Mozambican Strait.
The reef is a barrier, and the reefer inside is a growing ground for the rattlesnake shark.
This shark is not very timid, even during the day.
I had the instinct that at night, I would become bolder and more out, and there would be a lot more coming out.
Have you ever seen so many sharks in an outcrop of a single coral?
By capturing and sharing these moments, I remember why I followed this path.
This year, I already did the National Geographic work on the Baja California Peninsula.
About half way from the Pacific side of the peninsula, there is the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is an important breeding ground for gray whales.
This coastal area was a place where mass killings lasted for a hundred years, and more than twenty thousand wart whales were killed, and only a few hundred survived.
Today, the offspring of the whale gently push their children onto the sea level, letting them play, and even interact with us.
This species has made a truly amazing comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula is a quiet fishing town called Kabo Purmo.
It was on the verge of collapse due to decades of overfishing.
In 1995, a local fisherman called for the sea to be designated as a marine protected area.
What happened after that was nothing more than a miracle.
In 2005, even though it's only been a decade since we started protecting them, the number of fish has recovered unprecedentedly.
But look at it with your own eyes. Let's go together.
Breathe in, go deep, and swim in the largest, densest school of fish I've ever encountered.
Everyone can create hope.
Through my photos, I want to tell you that it's not too late to protect our oceans.
In particular, I want to focus on the resilience of nature in front of seven billion people.
My hope is that in the future, if we don't look for them very well, we won't be able to take pictures like this, and we're going to be able to take pictures that will be a model for coexistence with the ocean.
I just hope that it becomes a daily occurrence.
In order to survive in my profession and move on, I have to be an irresistible optimist.
I'm always working on my assumptions, and I think that the wonderful photos that encourage change are right around the corner, and beyond that coral, in the reef lake, or beyond that, I think there's a great picture that inspires change.
When I moved to Harare, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's health policy.
At the end of a long war of independence, a new government came along, and immediately declared a socialist policy, and medical services, primary education, and so on, basically free.
We've significantly increased the number of regional health facilities, and we've achieved a remarkable achievement that about eighty percent of the population can reach the medical facilities within two hours of their walk.
In the 1980s, when Zimbabwe became independent, the vaccination rate for domestic children was 25%.
Just ten years later, in 1990, it reached 80%.
I was really proud to be involved in this major reform.
The excitement and unity of the people was so visible that I could see it.
I felt like I was part of the world's leading public health movement, not just the independence movement in Africa, with the most powerful people on the ground, with the most powerful public health movement in the world.
But there was a terrible problem.
The year I arrived, the first case of AIDS in Zimbabwe was reported.
In the early '80s, I had seen some AIDS patients at Harlem General Hospital, where I was a trainee, and I couldn't imagine what was close to Africa.
In the early days of my stay, the HIV infection rate was about two percent.
Seventeen years after I left Harare, the fact that it soared and one in four adults was infected.
By the mid-1990s, I had announced that I was HIV positive for hundreds of people.
I've experienced the death of my colleagues and friends, and I've seen the deaths of students and patients.
In response, I set up a clinic with my colleagues.
to demonstrate how to use condoms
and started sex education at school and at work
They can do case studies, they can teach their infected partners how to prevent it.
I was working hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I was going to do a good treatment, and now I think about it, it was poor.
But they weren't doing anything that called for structural reform.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly turned Rwanda into genocide.
He said he had turned to the UN peacekeeping force.
At the memorial service for the 10th year of the massacre, I looked back on that time, and I thought, "I was convinced at the time that I was doing my best, but the massacre happened, and I realized that there were more things I could do and more things I could do, and I knew there was something to do, and there was something I needed to do, and I had to do something to do, and I had to do something to do, and I had to do something to
The AIDS pandemic has made the medical outpoken, and the World Health Organization's prediction is that I'm not the only one who regrets that it should have acted sooner, as it is said that thirty-nine million people have died from AIDS.
But during my stay in Zimbabwe, I didn't think about it in terms of advocating change or being in a political position.
I came here as a clinician and epidemiologist to make use of my specialized skills.
In my heart, I thought that my role was to take care of patients, to investigate, to understand the patterns of infection in the population, and to stop the spread of this virus.
I was aware that there was a high risk of developing and dying AIDS, biased against the vulnerable in society.
Sixty percent of pregnant women in a farm like a feudal-era manor were HIV positive, more than any modern company organization, a sugarcane farm.
I taught them that being infected is not a sloppy person, but rather a product of male-dominated culture, forced seasonal labor, and colonialism.
The whites were almost completely undamageed.
As health care workers, we were so powerless that we just begged to reduce the number of people who have sex with us to change our individual behavior, to use condoms, to reduce the number of people who have sex.
The infection rate was only going to go up, and there was a cure in the West, and it was the most effective AIDS treatment today, but it was out of reach for any public sector in Africa.
I was silent, saying nothing about the lack of equal access to life-saving drugs, or the political and economic systems at the root of the AIDS epidemic, or the mechanism that caused the massive infection.
I justified my silence, and I told myself, "I'm not a citizen of this country, and if I sound the alarm, I can't even be deported, I can't do good jobs, I can't see patients, I can't do the research that's needed."
So I kept quiet, and I didn't even say my opinion about the government's policy on AIDS at the time.
I didn't fully assert my concerns.
I'm sure many of the doctors and health care workers would think that I didn't fail.
The promise of doctors and patients, The Hippocratic Oath and another version, define the sanctity of the relationship between doctors and patients.
I did everything I could for my patients, and I did the best I could for my patients.
But I realized that this pandemic was a reflection of social distortions, not only because of biological causes, but rather because I understood that it stems from the practice of alienating, excluding, excluding, and discriminating the weak, such as race, gender, sexuality, and social class.
AIDS is in this.
and the same thing happened to the last ebola.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, who has been working on anti-AIDS in Haiti, call this "structural violence" because inequality is embedded in the political and economic structure of our society, and it is often not visible to people with privilege and power, because it is often invisible to people with privilege and power, because "violence" means that this phenomenon causes death, suffering, and disease at a young age, is violent.
If we want to help patients even a little bit, we must not neglect to recognize these social inequalities.
Calling attention is the first step to making public health work, and in doing so, we can bring together collaborators, pave the way, and make real changes.
so recently, i'm not silent.
I'm talking about a lot of things, and I'm talking to people who are uncomfortable, even when I'm uncomfortable.
In many cases, it's about racial disparities, about institutionalized racism, it's about things that shouldn't be in this country anymore, and it's not allowed in the medical field or in public health.
And because it exists, people are losing their lives without living their lives.
So the alarm should be sounded — the racism in American medicine, the ongoing institutional, interpersonal violence — the violence of people of color — the two-and-a-half years of slavery that left a painful legacy in the United States for the violence of people of color, the violence that has been inflicted on the United States for ninety years, and the violence that has increased due to the incomplete equality of sixty years, and the violence that has increased by the incomplete equality of sixty years, is at the heart of my New York City health director.
In New York City, the young mortality rate for black men under the age of 65 is 50 percent higher than that of white men.
In 2012, there was a maternal mortality rate for black women, more than a decade, more than a decade for white women.
Infant survival has improved dramatically, but black infants are still nearly three times more likely to die in the first year of life than white infants.
New York is not special.
You can see the same statistics anywhere in the United States.
According to a recent New York Times analysis, one and a half million black men are missing across the United States.
According to the article, today, more than one in six black men between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four have disappeared from their daily lives, whether they died in prison or at a young age.
There's a lot of injustice, and there's a lot of violence that's going on every day for young black men, and it's the violence that's the subject of protest, known as the #BlackLivesMatter.
But it's important to remember that although the incidences are different, they're still occurring, and the effects of common diseases that continue to occur, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, and other diseases that slowly and quietly lead to death, and because of these young deaths, black people are dying even more.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement started, I was frustrated and angry, because the medical community has been avoiding the use of the word "racism" in research and work.
Every time I used that word, I didn't think you'd have anything to think about.
Most people in the medical community were standing on the sidelines of doing nothing, and the discrimination that still exists continues to affect the way diseases and the mortality rates, and what I'm worried about is what I'm worried about.
In today's modern trend towards personalized medicine and precision medicine, in the modern trend is that in pursuit of more personalized treatments, inadvertently lose sight of the whole picture, the everyday environment in which people live, grow, work, and love each other, is the most impacting on people's health, and harming the health of so many people, and it's the health of too many people.
As health care workers, we see a terrible injustice in our day-to-day work, in our clinics, and in our research, we see a lot of injustice in our day-to-day work, because we can't do what the doctors are instructed to do, because there are more demanding priorities, because transgender young people think about suicide because of society that is so ruthless, and single mothers are responsible for their child's health.
As a health care worker, the role of a physician is not just to see the patient, but to be a proponent for attention and a call for change.
Doctors, regardless of their legitimacy, because of their social status, have a lot of weight on their statements, and they don't waste it.
I regretted not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I swore to myself that as the New York City Health Commissioner, I would take as much of the opportunity I had as much as possible, to call attention to it, and to help improve the health care gap.
We're going to fight racism, and I'm going to help you with gender discrimination, and I'm going to help you with all kinds of other forms of inequality.
Now is the time for us to stand up and speak out as a group against structural inequality.
You don't have to know all the answers to call for change.
It just takes courage.
The health of our patients and the health of all of us depends on it.
I'd like to ask you to raise your hand, and have you ever made a friend on Facebook? Because the person made some unpleasant remarks about politics, religion, parenting, and food.
Who doesn't want to talk to at least one person who doesn't want to talk to you?
In the past, in order to be polite and have a conversation, I wish I had followed the words of Professor Higgins of My Fair Lady to talk about the weather and health.
These days, climate change, anti-vaccination, and so on, and it's no longer a safe topic.
In the world we live in, every conversation can lead to controversy, and politicians can't talk to each other, and there are people who are really willing to discuss small issues, and they disagree, and they disagree.
The Pew Research Institute surveyed ten thousand American adults, and they found that people are now more polarized and at odds than ever in history.
They don't try to compromise, they don't listen.
And we decide based on what we already believe in where we live, who we marry, who we're going to be friends with.
And that, too, is that you don't have ears to hear.
Conversations need a balance between speaking and listening, but we've lost that balance somewhere.
and technology development is also a factor.
Your cell phone is still in your hands, or it's within reach.
According to the Pew Research Institute, a third of teenagers send more than a hundred messages a day.
Most of them probably do more to Messe than face to face.
In the magazine "Atlantique"
there's an interesting article written by a high school teacher named paul barnwell
He gave the students a communication challenge.
I wanted to teach them how to talk about a specific subject, without using notes.
And he said, "I've noticed."
“The ability to talk is the most overlooked skill that teachers are failing to teach.
Students spend hours every day on the screen, interacting with ideas and other people, but they have little opportunity to hone their interpersonal skills.
It may sound strange, but we have to ask ourselves, is there anything more important in the skills of the 21st century than the ability to speak with a sense of certainty?
I'm talking to my job, and I'm a Nobel laureate, a truck driver, a billionaire, a kindergarten teacher, a head of state, a plumber.
I talk to people I like, people I don't like.
Personally, I talk to people who disagree with me at all.
And yet, you can have a great conversation with them.
I'm going to teach you how to talk and how to listen in the next ten minutes.
You've probably heard a lot about the secret of conversation, whether you look into the other person's eyes, think about topics you're interested in in advance, you're looking at them, you're looking at them, you're going to tell them what you're paying attention to, you're going to look at them, you're going to look them up, you're going to tell them you're going to be careful, you're going to look at them, you're going to see them, you're going to tell them you're going to be careful, you
Forget all that.
it's not helpful.
You don't have to learn how to make it look like you're listening carefully, and you don't have to be careful, if
(Applause) I use my professional interviewing skills in my daily life as well.
I'm going to teach you the art of interviewing, and it helps us to improve our conversation, so that we can learn how to have a conversation that doesn't waste each other's time, doesn't get bored, and doesn't hurt the other person.
We've all had great conversations.
I know what it's like.
It's a conversation that feels like a breakaway when you're drawn into the conversation, that you've made a real connection with the other person who's been really inspired.
There's no reason why most of the conversations shouldn't be like that.
Let's take a look at the ten basic rules of conversation together, and if you master one of them, you'll be able to enjoy a better conversation.
The first one is “Do not do” while you are doing it.
Not only do you stop playing with your phone, tablet, or your car keys.
It means that you and your heart are there.
to be in that moment.
Don't think about arguing with your boss.
Don't think about what to do for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, please, but don't participate in half.
Number two, don’t talk to one side.
If you want to make your opinion claim without a response, without arguments, without a chance to argue, or grow up, write a blog.
The reason I don't put a dogmatic talker on my show is because it's boring.
If you're a conservative, you don't like Obama, food stamps, abortion.
If you're a liberal, you're probably not going to like big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
i know what you're saying.
it's not going to be like that.
We need to be in a conversation with the attitude that we have to learn something.
The famous therapist, M. Scott Peck, said, "You really need to put yourself aside to listen."
This means that sometimes you need to put your opinion aside.
“When you feel that you are accepted, the speaker does not feel defenseless, and you start to show the listener to the depths of your heart.”
i repeat. let's start with a learning attitude.
Bill Nye once said, “Everyone you meet knows something you don’t know.”
I would say, "Anyone can be an expert in anything."
Ask yourself a free answer question.
Let's learn from journalists.
Ask questions that start with when/where/who/what/what/what?
Even if you ask a complex question, it will only give you a simple answer.
If you ask, “Are you scared?”
It's the most impressive word in the question, and in this case it's "scary," and the answer is yes or no.
"Was he angry?" "Yes, he was very angry."
let the other person explain it to you, because what you know is over there.
I'm asking this question, "What did it look like?"
"How did you feel?"
Then the other person will have to stop and think, and then they'll have a much more interesting answer.
Number four, let it flow.
The idea that comes to mind has to go out and let it go.
You've probably heard of interviews like this, and after a couple of minutes of talking, the host's questions are completely irrelevant or they're answering before.
The moderator stopped asking two minutes ago, and he came up with a clever question, and he decided that this had to be said absolutely.
And we're doing exactly the same thing.
When I was sitting and talking to someone, I remember what I encountered in a coffee shop with the actor Hugh Jackman.
and stop listening.
Talks and ideas come to mind.
Just float it, and let it disappear.
Fifth, if you don't know, I'll tell you not to know."
People who are on the radio, especially in the case of NPR, know that what they've said is on record, so they're very careful when they say they're an expert or they know something for sure.
I hope you all do too much.
don't make it cheap.
Number six, don't equate your partner's experience with you.
It's about not telling people who have lost their family members when they're talking about losing their family.
When the other person is talking about a problem at the company, they don't tell you how disgusting their work is.
The other person and I have a completely different experience.
All the experiences are individual.
And more importantly, I'm not talking about myself.
You don't have to try to show you how wonderful you are and how troubled you are on that occasion.
Stephen Hawking was asked about IQ, and he said, "Come on, IQ boasting is a loser."
Conversations are not opportunities to self-promote. [21st century conversation]
"How are you doing today?" "Look at the blog!" Seven: "Don't say the same thing over and over again."
It's disgusting, it's disgusting, but we all tend to do it.
Especially in the workplace, in conversations with children, in order to show that your argument is correct, you change your words and repeat them.
don't do that.
Number eight, don’t worry about the details.
Frankly, they don't care about the details, they're not concerned about the details, they're detailed, like the year, their names, the dates, and so on, and they're trying to remember, but they're struggling to remember.
They're not interested in you. They're interested in you.
What kind of people you have and what you have in common?
So let's forget the details. No need.
Number nine, this isn't the last one, but it's the most important thing.
"Listening"
I don't know how many great people have said this, but listening is the most important skill that everyone can develop.
It's Buddha's words, and I'm going to paraphrase it a little bit, but when my mouth is open, I don't learn anything.
According to Calvin Coolidge, “No one has been fired for what they heard.”
Why don't we listen to each other?
One is that I'd rather talk than I'd rather talk than I'd listen.
when you're talking, you have the initiative.
You don't have to ask them what they're not interested in.
Be the focus of attention.
You can strengthen your identity.
But there are other reasons, because they distract you.
Normal people speak twenty-five words a minute, but we can hear up to five hundred words a minute.
Our consciousness tries to fill the remaining two hundred and seventy-five words.
It takes effort and energy to keep your attention on them, but if you can't do that, you're not having a conversation.
They're in the same place, screaming unrelated words.
we have to listen to each other.
The writer, Steven Covey, put it brilliantly.
"A lot of people don't listen to understand.
I am listening to you to answer.”
There's another rule, and the ten are, "Simply."
[My sister said, "A good conversation is like a miniskirt, to be as short as you can be interested, but to cover the bottom line as long as possible.") (Applause) Everything I've said so far can be summed up in one thing: "Be interested in the other person."
I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and it was a routine in my house.
And when I talk to my grandparents, a lot of people come up to me, and after the customer leaves, my mother comes up to me and asks, "Do you know who he is?"
she became quasi miss america.
that person, sacramento mayor.
She's a Pulitzer Prize winner. He's a dancer in a Russian ballet.
So I'm saying that everyone has something hidden, something amazing.
I started to believe that this is what makes me a good host.
I'm hoping to be as open as I can, and I'm going to be impressed, and I've never been disappointed.
Do the same for all of you.
You go out, you talk to people, you listen, and most importantly, you expect them to be impressed.
thank you for your attention.
hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I'm taking a medal in three sports competitions at the national tournament in Canada, and in basketball, I participated in world-class games, and I was honored to represent Canada in the world championships.
(Applause) Five days a week, I go to basketball and speed skating practice, and the top coaches and mental performance consultants are helping me to get the best out of the game.
by the way, this is all about the special olympics.
Will it change the way you look at me and my results?
The world doesn't necessarily see people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were alienated and out of public.
It's changed a lot since the Special Olympics began in the 1968s, but in so many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider world.
I don't think it's a bad thing for people to use discriminatory terms in front of my eyes.
They use the word "retarded" in contempt.
So I'm not thinking about how hurt I and my friends will be.
Don't think that I'm here as an object of pity.
I'm here because there are still serious problems with the public's view of the mentally disabled, because there's a problem with the lack of sight in so many cases.
Did you know that there was a world conference this year?
I was one of six hundred and fifty-five hundred athletes with intellectual disabilities, and athletes from 165 countries gathered in LA to compete.
More than sixty-two thousand spectators were watching the opening ceremony, which was broadcast live by sports television stations TSN and ESPN.
You didn't know that kind of meeting, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
It's a challenge for you, and will you see us as equals?
The Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities, and the values of all the people who see it.
For those who don't know, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It's different from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
High-level sports competitions are held for the mentally disabled throughout the year, and the lives and values of the people involved change.
And that changed my life, and the lives of so many other people.
And the public eye that sees the intellectually disabled has also changed.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.
I played hockey from a young age until I was twelve.
As I grew older, it became harder and harder to keep up with everyone, and I was frustrated and angry.
I was completely away from sports for a while, and I didn't have many friends, and I was sad to feel left behind.
In the old days, people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought that they could participate in sports, let alone, that they were a valuable part of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the motor skills of children with intellectual disabilities.
According to a rigorous scientific approach, Dr. Hayden and the other researchers concluded that "the lack of motor skills for children with intellectual disabilities is simply because they lack the opportunity to participate in the exercise."
For people with intellectual disabilities, exercise programs and sports competitions are beneficial.
There weren't many people who believed, but the pioneers, Dr. Hayden, and the special Olympics founder, Eunice Kennedy Shrieve, never gave up, and the athletes proved they were right, more than four and a half million times.
(Applause) Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was anxious, young, shy, shy, unsure, and had few friends.
But when I went there, everyone encouraged me and supported me, and I was able to be myself, not worrying about people's eyes.
Now I'm a basketball and speeding skater, I've competed in state competitions and national competitions, and this year I've competed in the summer world championships in LA, and this year, as a member of the basketball team, the first time I've made it to the world championships, as a member of the basketball team, which was the first time for the Canadian national team to advance to the world championships.
(Applause) I'm one of the four and a half million athletes in the world, and I've heard a lot of similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics player gives us back our pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also meets the health needs of athletes.
According to the study, men with intellectual disabilities have a life expectancy of thirteen years shorter than that of healthy people, and twenty years shorter for women.
But in the Special Olympics, you can move your body, and you can stay healthy by participating in the competition.
Coaches also teach you about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics offers free health checks, which are targeted at athletes who are difficult to communicate with doctors or are hard to reach medical care.
In the summer world championships, my team, Canada, played against a Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian team underwent a health check-up at the venue, and seven of the ten members received free hearing aids, and for the first time in their lives, they were able to hear clearly.
(Applause) The players have made some incredible changes.
I was more active, I was playing with more energy, I was playing with confidence, because I was able to communicate with my coach in the flesh and face.
I was so excited, because I was able to hear the ball, and the sound of the whistle, the cheers of the fans in the stands, and for everyone, it's a natural sound to be heard.
the athletes of the special olympics are not only in the competition
Life changes outside the stadium.
According to a survey conducted this year, nearly half of all adults in the United States have no intellectual disabilities, and forty-four percent of Americans, who have very low acceptance and have a very negative view of the disabled.
And the sheer use of these discriminatory languages is evidence that the intellectually disabled are still invisible to many.
They use it as a casual expression or a word of impossibility.
Last year's retardation was more than nine million tweets, but it's a word that really hurts me and the four and a half million athletes around the world.
I don't think it's an insult to anyone, but that's a mistake.
John Franklin Stevens, a fellow fellow global messenger, wrote an open letter to a political commentator who scorned people with the discriminatory language, and he said, "Come to the Special Olympics one day.
if you can go home without being moved, please try it.
(Applause) At the World Championships this summer, people lined up for hours to watch the final day of the weightlifting competition.
In the midst of everyone standing, my teammate Jackie Barrett, commonly known as the Great Deer of Newfoundland, raised 297kg in a deadlift, 277kg in a squat, (Applause) and broke the record for the best time at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the weightlifter on Newfoundland, not just in Special Olympics, but among all weightlifters.
In LA, he became a big star, and the ESPN station tweeted his new record live, and I was impressed by Jackie's performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one thought that the intelligently disabled could do that.
This year, sixty thousand spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games, and to support the athletes from 165 countries.
We were not only hidden, but also cheered and honored.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to have confidence and pride.
People around the world teach us that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and respect.
(Applause) I now have a track record and dreams in competition, I've got great coaches, I've got respect, dignity, I'm healthier than I was before, I'm a personal trainer.
(Applause) I'm no longer hiding or being bullied, and I'm doing TED Talks here and now.
(Applause) The Special Olympics have changed the world, but we still have a long way to go.
If you see the next person with an intellectual disability, I want you to look at their abilities.
If you see someone who uses a discriminatory language, tell them how bad it is.
and i want you to think about getting involved with the special olympics.
(Applause) And I'm going to say one last thing.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
Special Olympics is changing the world, where four and a half million athletes are reborn, where they can be confident, they have friends, they can't be seen by prejudice, they can feel the champion, they can actually become champions.
Thank you very much.
Kenema in Sierra Leone, Arua in Nigeria, have you ever heard of a place name like that?
It's the rarest place for me.
In that hospital, nurses, doctors, and scientists have been quietly fighting one of the most terrifying enemies of humanity for years, the Lassa virus.
the latsa virus is very similar to the ebola virus
They cause high fevers, sometimes they even kill.
But they're protecting us all by risking their lives every day and protecting the people of the local community.
But what surprised me the most was that they started singing every morning on the very hard front lines, singing and starting to come to mind.
and they came together to express their joy.
and show your energy.
We've been visiting each other for years, and we've been meeting each other, singing, singing, and really having fun, because we're not there for the pursuit of science, but because we're connected by human love.
I can imagine that it becomes something that becomes very important and essential as things change.
In March, that changed a lot, when the Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa near the Sierra Leone-Liberia border.
we're afraid.
In fact, for a while, Lassa and Ebola were more prevalent than we thought, and I thought that one day we might reach Kenema.
So my team members immediately took action and joined Dr. Huma Khan's team, and they had a highly sensitive virus RNA detector, ready to detect Ebola when it crossed the border into Sierra Leone.
I already had a device like this for the Lassa antivirus, so I knew the method, and the team was really good.
All we had to do was provide them with the tools and the places to test for Ebola.
But unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23rd, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of the hospital, and the team tested for viral RNA, and we saw the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
Their work was very good.
We started a contact tracing to immediately determine this case, to treat the patient safely, and to understand the situation.
This could have stopped the spread of infection early.
But by that time, the outbreak had already been going on for months.
there were hundreds of cases that outweed the previous outbreak
When we reached Sierra Leone, it was not a case of another, but like a tsunami.
In order to tackle this infection, we worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, and the Kenema government, and the following week, there were thirty-one cases, and ninety-two, and then, 147 cases, all patients, went into Kenema, because there are limited facilities in Sierra Leone that can handle this disease.
We did everything we could for twenty-four hours, and we did everything we could to save patients, to alert them, and then do another simple thing.
I was glad that the blood samples of the patients I was taking to detect Ebola were, of course, discarded.
Instead, they inactivated the virus with drugs, and they put blood samples in boxes and sent them across the ocean to other research facilities.
i sent my team to boston.
And then I kept working day and night, and I worked shifts every day, and I quickly analyzed the jinom of the ninety-nine Ebola virus.
The jinom of the virus is the blueprint.
jinom is for everyone.
It represents the nature of everything that makes up us, and it contains a huge amount of information.
The results of this kind of work are simple, but very powerful.
I was able to observe and compare these ninety-nine viruses, and compared to the three gynoms that were previously announced in Guinea, and I was able to figure out that the outbreak started in Guinea months ago, and then it spread through humans, and then it spread through humans.
This is very important to understand how to intervene, but what matters is contact tracing.
We've confirmed that the virus is mutating as it infects humans.
It's very important to observe each and every mutation, because diagnostic devices, vaccines, treatments, and all these things are basically made based on the gynom sequence.
International health experts need to take steps to do that, and we need to adjust and rework all the results we've had so far.
And the way I was working as a scientist was, first of all, I was going to put the data in my lab for months and months, and I was in the lab for months and months, and I was able to analyze the data carefully, carefully, and to publish a research paper, I had several exchanges, and when the paper was finally published, I would publish the data.
This is the current state of the flow of research by scientists.
But you couldn't have done that, could you?
My friends were on the front lines, and what was very clear was that they needed help, and they needed a lot of help.
So the first thing I did was, after the jinom sequence was read, I immediately published it on my website.
But I said, "Please lend me your help," and I said, "Let's get the data out of the world."
and the help came.
And in no time, I was surprised to hear that the data was being released, and I got a call from people from all over the world.
One of the best virus tracking teams in the world suddenly joins us.
We started working together virtually, and we started talking about phone calls and emails, and we tracked the virus minute by minute, and we thought about how to stop the spread of infection.
There are many ways to build a community in such an emergency.
Especially when outbreaks began to spread on a global scale, everyone actively researched, engaged, and helped.
and they wanted to get involved.
The ability of these people around the world is truly amazing, and the Internet connects us all.
Imagine, rather than looking at each other as a threat and avoiding each other, they're like, "Let's do this."
and we're going to solve this together.
The problem was that the data we were all using was very limited and insufficient, that we searched on the Internet.
In that case, there are so many possibilities, and opportunities are lost.
In the early days of the Kenema epidemic, there were a hundred and sixty-six medical records, and we decided to publish them all over the world.
And in our lab, we were able to prove that we could predict the prognosis for Ebola patients by going to computers from the 106th, with a precision of nearly one hundred percent, and that's for the medical professionals who work there.
We've created an app to offer, but in order for the app to be effective enough to prove it, we're going to have it
The 106th was not enough at all, and we were waiting for more data to come out before the release.
but it didn't come out with the data.
Everyone was studying and thinking about it, and they were still waiting, but they weren't locked in silos and weren't using the power of cooperation.
but this is not possible.
Don't you think so?
it's at stake for our lives.
In fact, a lot of lives were lost, medical personnel, five of my most important colleagues, Bar Fony, Alex Mogboy, Dr. Hummer Khan, Alice Koboma, and Mohamed Fuller.
They were five of the many medical professionals who died in and around Kenema, and they were all working in and out of the world, as the world was waiting, and we were silently working in pieces.
Ebola is the same threat to other humans, and it grows with suspicion, a drag on the foot, a discordant.
When we build walls between each other and fight each other, the virus becomes more powerful.
But unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola is equally relevant to all of us.
we're fighting together.
If one person gets Ebola, it could immediately be transmitted to someone else.
I hope that in a situation where our lives are equally fragile, have the same life force, and have the same fears and hopes, we can work together with joy.
I read a book about Sierra Leone, and I learned that the name of the city where we work, the name of the city, Kenema, actually means, in the words of the Mende people of Sierra Leone, which means "as clear as a river and transparent to everyone's eyes."
And I felt a very deep sense of it, because even before we knew it, we've always respected the Kenema people, we've always tried to share information and work together in an open environment.
and that's important.
Because when an outbreak occurs, we need to share information with ourselves and everyone around us, not to hide it, to fight it together.
This is not the first Ebola outbreak, this is not the last, and there are still many other microorganisms that are still lurking, like the Lassa virus.
And the next outbreak, it could happen in a big city with millions of people.
It could be an airborne virus.
They may deliberately spread the virus.
This is a terrible thing, of course, of course, but at the same time, what this experience taught us is that we have the technology and the ability to respond to it, that we can win the battle against viral infections and gain the upper hand.
But it will be possible for us to join forces, and let's do it with joy.
Dr. Khan, who died in the fight against infectious diseases, and the people who lost their lives on the front lines, and they fought with us all the time, and we will continue to fight this battle with them.
Let's light up the world with billions of warm hearts and compassion so that the world is not swayed by the destruction of a single virus.
Thank you very much.
