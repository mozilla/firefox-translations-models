Was the Destiny Plan of "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny" a hit that Durandal was touched by Talia?
Because of the genetic discrepancy, I broke up with the talia because I couldn't have a child, so is the gene so correct?

We are also running a new product that can only be eaten at this time of year and a campaign that you can get!
That’s why I don’t want to watch TV anymore...
Is it possible that the comedian has become impossible? TV is just a comedian.
I saw Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but when I say something that is not particularly interesting, there are quite a lot of scenes where the staff laughs behind the scenes.
It's obviously not an interesting place, but it's not creepy to laugh at everything you're saying because you're a selling entertainer.
But if the staff does not laugh, the mood of the entertainer will be damaged, and it will be dissatisfactory in terms of working.
Like the old black company, that industry is like a sports club, and some of the comedians' egos are too big and they have a normal disgusting attitude, so you can't eat them unless you do.
On the other hand, there are many theories that comedians themselves do not lick entertainers with the difficulty of their work.
I know that my income is quite small until I can sell, but even if I am told that comedians are at the top of the top of the bad occupations.
The beautification of one’s own career and the fact that the comedians are merely in the media and society are too high.
To be honest, the industry I work in is quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the entertainer world are becoming more and more impossible.
Sorry for complaining.
If I didn't go out like a fart, I felt like it wasn't good for my body.

The product ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without permission
Summary: When you ordered a cheap wireless mouse, the wired version of the mouse was received, and if you want a refund, you should return it.
It is a mail order problem rather than a self-made PC topic, but no matter how you think, it is not convincing and it is a famous place, so I will write here
The beginning of the discovery that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280yen (linked to Uotaku) at Tsukumo's day sale at Tsukumo Net Shop, which started the previous Friday
Since the wired version was the same price at the store, I also checked the wired version page considering the possibility of a price error, so I ordered it because it was 5,071yen (linked to Uotaku), so I ordered it considering the possibility that it was not a mistake
I received an order email normally, and I also received an e-mail shipped the next day.
In these two emails and the purchase history of My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written.
Since there was no notification of error or cancellation from the order to the shipment, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point
It was a problem from here, and a few hours after the shipment, I received an email saying "There was a mistake in the registration of the product"
According to the email,
* The wireless version was sold at a special price, but it was actually a wired version
* Since we have already shipped a wired mouse,
1.Reject receipt and cancel all
2.Return only the mouse and refund
3. Use a wired mouse as it is
Choose your response.
The product page of the wired version and the wireless version are divided, and it is written as a wireless version in the purchase history, email, and delivery slip, but it seems that it was sent without permission to the wired version
If you can send something different from the product you bought without an understanding, and if you want a refund, it is not bad to send it back from here?
In the end, I'll accept the refund, but I'd like to fight back one shot, so lend me my wisdom.
If you were looking for a marriage or partner, would you not want to be with someone who is not close to your family?

The only bridge that leads to the district due to typhoons and heavy rains has flown out Residents triple their stockpile food <Yasai Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Yoshiro Matsumoto in the Takajihara area of Yasai-cho, Fukushima Prefecture.
The typhoon in eastern Japan had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, it was like 'serious'.
I wonder if it will break so quickly, and I wonder if it will be swept away."The only road leading to the Takachihara area was washed away by the typhoon in eastern Japan, and thirty people from eleven households in the district became isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off water continued to carry the necessary supplies using JR's railway bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Normally, cars can come to the garden, but when I get out of the car there, I hold it in my hand or carry it on my back, I walk through the iron bridge, so I felt the means of transportation and the feeling of being grateful for the car."
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and the recovery has progressed, but Mr. Matsumoto continues to take measures that take advantage of lessons learned.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about ten cases.
For the time being, I want to secure 2-3 days somehow."
Misako Matsumoto: "I don't know when a disaster will come on me, not someone else's business, so I felt it again that it would be better to do a little stockpile or something like that."
In order not to forget the lesson, the town began its own efforts from 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, chief of the Yasai-cho Education Division, said, "It is stipulated in the form of "Yamatsuri-cho Disaster Prevention Day", and after next year, October 12th is a day to think about disaster prevention preparedness, and there are also announcements.
I think it’s getting more and more awareness about what’s unexpected can happen.”
Articles at the time of purchase
Since the test itself is almost over, I just write a sentence, but I also do a follow-up test to see if the measurement is wrong for the time being, so please wait a little.
I know you're not sure about the measurement results.

Experience Paramarathon in VR (TOKYO MX) - Yahoo! News
On December 12, 2021, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government held an event that allowed it to run on a digitally recreated Paralympic marathon course.
This event was held to let people experience the new joy of sports and the charm of tourism that Tokyo has through digital.
A running machine and a road bike were prepared at the venue, and visitors to the venue were speeding through the Paralympic marathon course, which was reproduced in a virtual space with special equipment.
Each tablet that displays a virtual space has its own avatar, and it is a mechanism that allows you to experience competing while running a marathon course with participants from Japan and abroad, and you can also enjoy sightseeing spots in Tokyo.
The participant said, "The scenery was amazingly different and it was a lot of fun."
"It's hard to run while running through the streets of Tokyo, but it's very fun to be able to run while having fun, and I'm glad that I was able to compete with everyone and work hard until the end."

What are the pitfalls of the "building situation survey system" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
Toward Revitalizing the Used Housing Market Newly Established "Building Situation Survey" System The second-hand housing transaction is strong.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums have risen, and the remodeling market is also on the rise.
While the coronavirus pandemic has increased the desire to own a home, the popularity of properties such as "station, station near, station directly connected", "large scale" and "tower" that are soaring is concentrated, and the relatively cheap new construction has drastically decreased.
[See image of this article] However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) revised the Real Estate and Building Business Act in 2018 and launched a survey called Inspection, a so-called inspection survey for the purpose of trading safe and secure used houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is familiar with housing checks the current situation including the deterioration of the property and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explained that the introduction of inspection will have benefits for both buyers and sellers.
This is because the seller can avoid post-delivery claims by conducting property surveys before trading, giving the buyer a sense of security.
This will also lead to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that can grasp the state of the second-hand house to be purchased and can be purchased convincingly, and at first glance it is a system with great merit.
However, in the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the initiative in the building situation survey.
In addition, I would like to note that it has become an obligation only to announce the system of inspection.
In other words, the real estate business operator in charge of the brokerage has an obligation to explain that “we can introduce an architect who conducts building situation surveys when brokering” or “I can’t”, but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, when you turn overseas, the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used market is booming, already have a similar system in place.
In the pre-house trading phase, the buyer asks an expert called the Inspector or the Building Surveyor to conduct a building survey.
In the United States, for example, inspection is conducted in 70 to 90 percent of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.
In terms of "buyer" leading the inspection, the Japanese-style inspection of the main "seller" and its nature are very different.
The seller tries to show the condition of the building a little better, and sells it as high as possible and as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to study the contents of the survey and live with peace of mind with appropriate repairs.
Even if it is the same inspection, the purpose and thoughts of both sides have a gap.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as a risk of concern regarding the Japanese system.
● The scope of the investigation of the seller-led inspection specified by the state shall be kept to a minimum.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of missing out really important defects ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) who will introduce the case in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "timidual" inspection will be carried out, such as not reporting the unfavorable results to the seller

It was pretty hard.
However, because it was cured mentally (?), the motivation was full.
I fell asleep at work because I couldn't keep up with my body and it was a research job.
It was the second time in a year, so I took about a month to rest and say goodbye to the fucking garbage company, and I thought about it lightly, but I wanted to see it worse than I thought and the medicine did not fit, so I took it for a long time.
Anyway, it is important to have a psychiatrist and deal with it correctly and leave a hospital history (super important)
Even if you leave the company at your own convenience as long as you have a history of hospital visit, you can change it to the retirement of the company convenience by the judgment of the doctor in Halova, so the hurdle to receiving unemployment insurance etc. will be down.
Even if you can't find a job inside, even if you want to take a break a little, you can afford both your pocket and mind.

Was Ginza an island?
Five Miscellaneous Studies You Can Talk About While Brutting Silver (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
“It used to be a peninsula.
On the evidence of that... It is unique to Ginza that you can show off a little miscellaneous learning.
We will introduce the trivia of Ginza that is interesting to know and will surely want to talk to someone.
Go to Ginza! ?
First infiltration into Kinza
When you walk through Ginza, you will find remnants of the history of Ginza, including quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and many shrines.
Walking with her in Ginza, she unexpectedly visited the silence and said, "This is a peninsula for a long time.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
Ginza is synonymous with the downtown area that created ○○ Ginza in various parts of Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" was a foundry of silver coins, and in the 1612s, the Ginza office, which had been placed in present-day Shizuoka City, moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called 'Shin-Kaigare-cho,' but when it moved to 蛎��町, it came to be called 'Ginza'.
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "senible" that protruded into the sea.
Before the Edo period, there were inlets from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and from Nihonbashi to Ginza, the peninsula called "Edomaejima" stretched.
The tip of the peninsula is the present Ginza.
When Ieyasu TOKUGAWA opened the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in Edo, he reclaimed the igoe and promoted the development of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu built a district and raised Horiwari in order to develop boat transportation.
Then, he cut down the soil and Mt. Kanda, which had been cut off the moat, and buried the cove.
In front of the Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of the "birthplace of Ginza" that shows the site of the Ginza government office, so why not look for the direction you are interested?
"Milky to the Holy Land" in Ginza
In Ginza, a "zoliday pilgrimage" is held every year called "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour" that is known only to those who know it.
Of the more than ten sacred places, the most likely to be found is "Kabuki Inari Shrine" in front of the Kabuki-za Theater.
Many people visit the shrine on the right side of the Kabuki-za Theater before and after the theater.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Success Jizoson" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine" and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley, and it is difficult to stand out, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known for revering by Kabuki famous actor Uzaemon Ichimura, and "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance of Shiseido Ginza Building 1F is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
In this shrine, there are places that enshrine Fudo Myoo and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, but most of the shrines have Inari enshrined deities.
"Inari-sha Shrine" where the fox welcomes us in front of the shrine is built in a place where many farmers have rice, as it is good for a "bountiful harvest of five grains" that rice often swells.
In large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it became said that business prosperity was beneficial, and even in Ginza, Japan's leading downtown area, faith spread.

Korea's Posco International acquires Australia's Senex Energy, expands overseas gas field business: South Korea (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on Tuesday that it has signed a share acquisition agreement with Senex Energy Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, the acquisition process is scheduled to be completed in March next year, with the approval of Senex Energy's general meeting of shareholders and approval from local subsidiaries.
The acquisition will be the largest global acquisition/merger (M&A) case since the integration of Posco International into the Posco Group.
The acquisition totaled 7709 billion won, of which Posco International decided to invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy to 49.9%, respectively.
Posco International said that demand for natural gas will continue to increase during the energy transition era, and that the natural gas-based blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will divide the market with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market, and decided to acquire this acquisition.
Posco International will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44 percent of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as local land gas field operations personnel.

The pain in the knee, maybe "osteoarthritis of the knee"! ?
Different Treatments for Different Causes (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor: I've been having knee pain lately.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, including injuries, rheumatism of the arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, many Japanese people have "osteoarthritis".
Editor: Does that mean the joints will be deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, and it is responsible for relieving the impact and smoothing the movement of the joints.
However, due to aging, obesity, and intense sports, the cartilage may become worn out or distorted.
As a result, it leads to deformation and inflammation of the joints.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis develop beyond the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knees, it can also occur in the joints and base of the fingers of the hands, the neck, the hips, the thumbs of the feet, the hip joint, etc.
However, the most common case is the case that occurs in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editor: What is the structure of the joint in the first place?
Mr. Maruyama: The joints are combined with two bones.
And the part where these two are facing is covered with "artial cartilage", and the circumference of the joint is wrapped in "artical wrap".
Editor: It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
In the inner layer of the joint package, there is a tissue called a synovial membrane, which makes joint fluid.
This articulative fluid plays a role in lubricants and consists of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good to smooth the movement of the knees.
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage has stickiness and elasticity, and it plays a role in preventing bones from directly hitting.
In other words, it is a role like a cushion.
However, if this becomes worn out or distorted, it will deform or inflame the joints, causing pain.

Three Gambling & Games in the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series, which boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the best things about this game is the extreme game that has given its life.
[Photo] Just looking at it, my legs slid ... ... Challenge the steel frame crossing!
So this time, I would like to verify the game of Kaiji that can actually be played or practiced in the planning video.
■Numa It is a pachinko full of traps that appeared in "Gambling Hakairoku Kaiji".
In the original story, he stunned Kaiji at a high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This "smoop" has a large trap of "nail forest", "movable" and "three-stage crun", and it was almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of hands, and finally he went out to the rough business of placing a vinyl water tank in the building and submerged the ground and tilting it, and he captured it brilliantly.
The "numa" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people play it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball 4000yen", and the difficulty is reduced, but you can taste the mood of Kaiji.
Steel-framed crossings The steel-framed crossing of "human horse racing" was carried out by debtors including Kaiji at the "Starside Party" held by the rich as entertainment.
The debtor proceeds with the idea of not falling over the thin steel frame installed ten meters above the ground, and competes for its speed.
Twelve people participated, and the top two can win the prize money, but there are only four steel frames, and the safety measures are insufficient, and the possibility of dying is quite high.
This steel-frame crossing is highly dangerous, but it was developed as a VR game, and you can have an extremely close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Life Park Miyagi, the home of professional baseball's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge is located at a height of 20m (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building) and has a steel-framed one-bridge, followed by "Sky Blanco" and "One Bridge of Victory", and you can walk.
Of course, safety measures are being implemented.
Koarashi, a comedian, posted a video on his YouTube page walking the Eagle Bridge, saying that he could experience steel-framed crossings in Japan, and it became a hot topic.
E-card A two-player card game, "E-card".
He uses one emperor's card, eight citizen's cards, and a total of ten slave cards, and plays it divided into the emperor's side and the slave side.
This game is very well made, and the emperor is strong in the citizens, the citizens are strong against slaves, and the slaves are strong in the emperor.
In the movie, Kaiji plays against Tonegawa with a strict rule that "if you lose, you can cut off your ears."
After all, Kaiji realized that a device that destroys the ear, such as earphones attached to the ear, was reading psychology by sensing and transmitting changes in the pulse and body temperature, and he confused the Tone River by cutting his own ears to the limit and making the body abnormal value, and he won.
The E-card is available on the market and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him playing the role of Kaiji in a movie with an E card, which attracted a lot of attention.
■Do you want to taste the feeling of Kaiji?
It is something that no one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read a manga, you only get a feeling.
Through the game, you can feel the world view.
A step toward the new year, gently boosting Tora's large ema at Gokoku Shrine|Yamagata Shimbun
At Gokoku-jinja Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the new year are underway, a large ema of next year's zodiac sign "Tora" appeared.
On the 11th, students of Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the shrine and held a memorial service in front of the gods.
The shrine has been asking for original paintings of ema from the past year to students of the University of Art and Technology.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), who was three years old, was drawn by nine people from the Japanese painting course of the art department, which is taught by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is three and a half meters wide, and the height of the center is about one and a half meters.
Tsuchiya said, "The image that the cherry blossoms gently push the back stepping into the new year" is said to have been drawn.
The tiger, who stopped and looked at the cherry blossoms, expressed his wish, "Even in a rapidly changing world, I want to be able to afford to enjoy the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted in ema, which is generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people overcome their difficulties."

Let's think about "I want to continue living in Tamano" To the proposal Four high school students workshop in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital|San Deji
What kind of town is Tamano in 2030?
A student representative from four high schools in Tamano City is working on a joint workshop on "I want to live in Tamano".
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the interim support organization "Tamano SDGs Mirai Creation Center", we will summarize the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayors.
“When is it fun?”
In response to the facilitator’s questions, students answer questions such as “when you get excited with a lot of people” and “when you play drums.”
It was held for the first time at the Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people discussed the "world cafe" method while moving the "island" with a fixed theme, and we thought about "an interesting town" "a town that is easy to live in" and a town that feels a sense of purpose.
Each idea is written on sticky notes, pasted on imitation paper, and organized.
"It seems interesting to have a town with a lot of young people" "Transportation such as trains and buses is indispensable for livability."
We will discuss whether or not we have anything in common.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but it's attractive to be able to cycle by the seaside," said a third-year student at Tamano Shoko High School (18).
A third-year student of Binan High School (18) said, "There are few shops, traffic is inconvenient, but it is good where nature is rich," and by talking with adults, he seemed to notice not only the issues of the region but also the charm.
In the second session in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the proposal.
In February of next year, the mayor and the head of education will be invited to present the announcement.
Rie Higashi, president of the center, said, "We hope that it will foster the love of high school students and that it will be an opportunity for young people to be actively involved in community development."

How to find a new way of stall (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
It is an indispensable stall in winter, but is there no time when the cloth is slapped around the neck?
It is good to adjust the balance by looking at the mirror after winding, but sometimes you may hear that you do not know the tips.
If I thought that there was a stall that can be wrapped quickly without a cloth, I found something novel.
The stall of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about one meter, and it is more compact than the general one.
When I first saw it, I was like, "" Can you wind it so short?
If you look closely, you can see that the whole is a net, making it into one piece by knitting a long and cut cloth.
In the eyes of the net, the edge of the stall is made to pass through.
So, even if you do not tie the ends and ends together, you can wrap it and hold it.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, the gilet (best) without sleeves is popular even in the jacket, but many people wear it in combination with the stole so that the shoulders do not cool down.
I think it would be helpful to have such a stall.

The Beatles documentary that comes to Disney Plus is super interesting
Get Buck was directed by Peter Jackson.
It's like a life-sized Beatles, and it's fresh.
I'm doing Gisgis because it was just before the dissolution, but it's not the dramatic gisgis that I imagined
While working hard and partitioning, such as a troublesome pole like "I know I'm ugly, but come on!", George who is sloppy "But ~", or John who is late and motivates while saying rather calmly opinions and jokes ... The apple of the role of Nagoma is also not actively talking, sitting in the face with "I'm in trouble" behind you
I don't hate each other so much that we fight like that, but there's a very strong feeling in the atmosphere of "Well, it's impossible to work together anymore", and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that.
And when you start playing in such an atmosphere, everyone is really full of talent
From a little phrase, each other said "How about this?" While doing "that masterpiece" is finished, the process of finishing it is bad
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing
It is amazing that the humm song like a casual hung hung gradually becomes that Zucha ♪ ♪ The scene where the lyrics enter is firmly recorded
It's amazing that you can't see the process of composing like this.
Also, it is natural, but everyone is getting fat, so you can be happy just by watching the performance scene
It seems to be one of the three episodes yet, but so far the biggest cause of the dissolution was the impression that it was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles itself
The four of them will be happy if they start making songs while complaining, but what about the place of the live? When we talk about it, it was easy to understand that the producers and advertising man-like people said like "After all the Beatles are from the world's best!"
Well, the documentary also includes the interpretation of the director, so Peter Jackson may have felt that way ...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising, so I thought that it was because of that that there were many scenes that Paul looked rather bad

I am from a sales job, but I was sick enough to change jobs, but at that time I was not good at doing sales activities on my own, but I thought that it was very suitable for sales activities that customers needed, so it was a different industry, but if I chose such a job and changed jobs, it became very easy to work.
I was told what I could not do, but I think that if I can find something that I am a little bit better at and what I can do, it will be at least easier to live in the future.
←Of course, I think that it is good to think about this after resting slowly and having room in your mind.
However, I think that there are also daily life, so if there is a company union, an industrial doctor, or a window where you can consult, there may be some kind of system, so I think that it is a good idea to consult once.
I hope that I can live with a little ease in the future.

Unseasonable Warmth and Strong Cold Effects of Tornadoes in the U.S. (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) of the local time, tornadoes occurred frequently mainly in the southern United States.
At this time, strong cold air went southward in a record-breaking place, and the atmospheric conditions became very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds seem to have developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed from the southwest to the southern United States, and it became a record high temperature.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday and Friday, the 9th and 10th, the highest temperatures have risen to around 30C.
At such a record-breaking place, strong cold air below -30°C has come south near 5500m above, so an active front has been formed due to a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds have developed rapidly along the front.
It seems that tornadoes occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The southern United States is originally an area prone to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer, it is a high season, and there are not many cases where there is a big damage at this time.
The tornado alert, which was issued in one day in the winter, reached nearly 150 times, a record-breaking high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than four hundred tornadoes and gusty winds on Friday.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale) shows the strength of the tornado, and it reached the third EF3 from the strong side of the six stages, and it is thought that a gust of around 70m / s blew at the moment.
Depending on the future investigation, it may be determined that it will be EF4 to EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version improvement Fujita scale) is used according to the situation of Japanese buildings based on the improvement Fujita scale.
JEF3, which is equivalent to this American tornado, is likely to occur in Japan, and wooden houses are at a level where they will collapse.

U.S. tornado "the largest in history" Voices for help with live broadcasts from under the rubble (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
On the 11th, President Biden expressed his opinion on the damage of tornadoes in the Midwest and South of the United States, with a mysterious look on the 11th (Japan time 12th) as “one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history”.
This was reported by CNN Television.
Biden said he would "do everything as the federal government."
"We still don't know how many lives have been lost," he explained.
The death toll was feared to be more than a hundred.
In Kentucky, where a tornado was damaged, residents carrying stolen houses, household goods, etc. occurred more than thirty tornadoes in at least six states, including Kentucky, between the night of the 10th and early morning of the 11th.
Twenty-nine miles (about 350km) of damage to the tornado were recorded in Missouri and elsewhere in 1925, but CNN's weather experts estimate that this time it was about 250 miles (about 400km), the largest.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, where the damage was severe, the candlelight factory, which was operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season, was also severely damaged.
There were 110 people on duty at the time, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace of it.
In the dark, a woman who was stuck under a thick rubble of about one or five meters felt the weight of the rescuer searching on the rubble and asked for help on a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the screams of the woman who called for help, the live broadcast also sounded the singing voice of "Happy Birthday to You", which seems to have been sung while crying to distract the fear of another woman.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, was safe hiding in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son because of a tornado warning.
"There are many people who compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrible sound like a ground sound that something more erupts," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police officer said: "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don’t know how many weeks, months, years, years.”
In Illinois, a warehouse in online shopping giant Amazon has partially collapsed, with at least six confirmed deaths.
The train has been derailed due to a shock that the train's vehicle is detached, and the highway has also been blocked one after another due to the influence of falling the vehicle.
According to Web Media, a total of about four hundred thousand homes in Tennessee are without power.
I have very few platelets.
What can I do to do more?
Eat high-puncture food and drink
Avoid coarse raw vegetables.
You should do something.

What does it mean to be a doctor of a gynecologist?
The doctor is three to five years old.
It is also called "major doctor" or "late-term resident doctor".
The so-called "trainee doctor" is "initial resident doctor" and refers to a doctor who is in the first or second year after graduation.
Speaking of immature, it is immature, but after 4-5 years, you will be able to provide some medical care, so you will be entrusted with various tasks.

It has been a long-standing discourse that the way of thinking about the evaluation system of the star system is different.
While foreign countries will deduct points from there based on five stars, Japan will add/deduct three stars as neutral.
At the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and the four stars have a completely different meaning in "There is a deduction element" and "It is not a masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece".
If you set the five stars as the standard, "works that only have no shortcomings" and "works of the highest level in everything" will be the same, so if there is such a tendency, I think that it would be a failure in the system that does not present the meaning of the star, but in fact such a system is operated like that, so please do not add three stars (bad reputation).
So if you try to argue with people who claim this kind of discourse in the two-choice evaluation of Steam, the story will not be mixed.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB, which can insert the size of a general hose?
The power supply capacity that can be obtained from USB is about 2A with 5V, so it is only 10W.
The submersible pump depends on the thing, but it consumes at least 500W, so it is impossible.

<Record of eating> "Hakobune" "Seas of seasonal fish fried and shrimp fried in the near sea homemade tartar sauce"|Life and Culture|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunch box "Seasonal fish fried and fried shrimp caught in the near sea homemade tartar sauce"
"hakobune" is a takeout specialty store with colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) using plenty of vegetables.
"I hope you can enjoy the restaurant feeling at home," said Takayuki Kazuki, 39, and Ms. Arimi, 38, opened in August last year.
One of the popular lunch boxes is "Frying seasonal fish caught in the near sea and fried shrimp homemade tartar sauce" (1000yen).
Fish choose the good things at the market.
"The fried breadcrumbs are as thin as possible so that you can understand the texture of the ingredients" (Mr. Takayuki), and the shrimp fries can directly understand the crispy texture.
There are about four kinds of vegetables and deli, which are garnished, and rice with small grains and soup are added to the rice mixed with Hinohikari from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are purchased at homemade soba fields and at a direct sales point in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki is training for French cuisine, and lapes and ratatutes add color.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, such as "a relaxing taste that you are used to eating" like a dashi-maki egg.
The bento box "Domestic match-biki meat hand-made hamburger steak" (1000yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, the company will also release a processed meat product "Charcutry Set" that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

There was something interesting at Haneda Airport that I happened to visit, so I tried using it
Ride comfort It is not so bad, but it shakes occasionally (not so much as drunkenness)
Speed, of course, slow.
Safety If there are people around you, the speed will slow down, and in some cases it will stop completely, so I think it is safe for the time being, but I thought it was dangerous depending on the place
The eyes around you Pain, it is good to be seen, but it hurts your heart to be seen as "in the way"
Overall review It's not bad, but there's still room for improvement.
It is a pity that it is easy to use if there are fewer people or if you have consideration such as having them stop at the end.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to build a dedicated lane so that it would not get in the way of other people walking.
However, I thought that it was a good vehicle if there were fewer people because I could relax and look at the scenery.
In the future, it was a difficult vehicle if you do not have a rather patient heart that is comfortable with the excitement of the near future feeling that such autonomous driving will become the mainstream and the pain of the surrounding eyes is comfortable.
Damn, I was embarrassed.

If you look closely, you may understand a little, but eel is not used at all.
Actually, it is "! eggplant!" (If you tap it, it will come out correctly)
I like eel, but in fact, I thought that the part of the eel was just eating with sauce, and I thought that it would be fine with anything other than actually baking ... I thought that the texture and quantity of eel was important.
I didn't want it to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat it.

A long way from a family that has rooted environmental protection efforts in the Chinese frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Find Asia, a Hong Kong company, a corporate consultant) With its vast land area, China is also important in terms of biodiversity, and the number of mammals living in the world is the world's largest, and the number three species of plants in the world is the third largest.
Some municipalities recognize the value of biodiversity, and some areas are promoting the activities of environmental activists as well as environmental protection conducted by local governments.
Sisapanna, Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is also one such area.
His sister, Li, is currently active as an actress in Sisapanna, a region that borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is an area where many ethnic minorities live, including the "Ei (Thailand) tribe" who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is flowing.
The area of Sisapanna, a self-governing province of Sisapanna (West Sobun-no-ji) is only about 0.2 percent of China's total, but it is home to about 25 percent of wild animals and 20 percent of the plants.
This time, we met with Mr. Li Koka, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and we talked about the contents of the activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband. ――It has been twenty years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the impetus?
Mr. Lee Our environmental protection activity "Tenji" started its activities from 2000.
This is my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
It is the only rainforest region in China and boasts one of the biodiversity.
However, economic development was also delayed.
Therefore, large-scale logging of the rainforest has progressed in order to root industry in the region and to produce rubber that was in short supply in China.
Her husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
I met and married a reporter here.
Did you have any interest in nature conservation before that?
Mr. Lee I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though their faces are not well-equipped and they are not particularly tall, but why do you think?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something that you want to go out of.
It is something that comes out naturally the moment you have confidence in yourself.

"I confessed to Sakura, and my heart is in full bloom in spring, and I will ask you to join me."

I want to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it at the time I want to open it later?
It is better to open it at the same time, the procedure will be completed faster.
It will be completed in about a week now.
In addition, there is no fee, so we recommend opening a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it.

[Oma ring / personal beformed] MOD It is the cause of CTD in its own environment, and it took about a month and a half to identify
Until March, stable data did not have much time to play since GW, and CTD due to multiple factors occurred, and it took a lot of time to identify it if I researched little by little only in the center of the holiday.
Why didn't you log analysis with .Net Script Framework (and you'll know in a few minutes)?Some errors in the .dll series and mesh relationship will not remain in the crash log.
〇Timing of the main CTD
* All papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and the .dll plug-ins log of the type that leaves the log do not leave footprints.
* Some NPC killings/attack cumulative times: Activated in console kill → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree's SE update resumption version) OFF improvement * Is there a possibility of false accusation about this?
* Basic improvement by turning off the kilmove setting by PC with .ini when the camera work of the kilmove activation for some NPCs? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit
* (Basic outdoor) field moving + some magic (e.g. freezing roon) activation, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID application setting (top right of MCM) All off and all five consecutive attempts improved.
Is it due to an additional armor worn by some actor / NPC and a mistake in the shader setting of the body mesh? In addition, the default .ini using SPID of 2.0 has a format mistake, but as a result, the intended result is the result and the premise Perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking by wedding falsely on part attack and OnHit-related motion / combat MOD (.dll), but it turned out like this.
I don't think there were similar bug reports at least at the English, German, or French level.
I thought that if there is a person with the same CTD problem in the Japanese environment, it may be helpful as a reminder.
Everyone is doing it with a smug mentality,
You don’t realize it, not just your friends, or your family.

I didn’t retire in the name of mentality, but I think that just before I retired was the limit.
Thinking about the importance of psychiatric home-visit nursing - Today's visit nursing is over
I have bipolar disorder, so I have been receiving visiting nurses for a long time, but I think that I have a long relationship with the nurse (woman) at the visiting nursing station I am currently using, and I have a very good relationship.
We talk a lot every week.
Of course, they will also do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but above all, I thought about how important fun communication is for people with mental illness with today's visiting nursing.
Today, we have a discussion about gender differences between men and women, or gender theory, and we have a laugh.
We also talk about the sexual desire of men and women, why she divorced, and how can I do such a thing as a visiting nurse?
Sometimes, I even dress up as a woman.
However, in the case of a visiting nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, I have heard from an acquaintance that a nurse who can not work in the ward comes and only takes administrative measures, or that an occupational therapist comes with a visiting nursing, but "I am doing medical care" from above.
What I am using is a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think that it is a really good nurse who faces Frank on an equal basis with me who has a mental illness.
By the way, you are beautiful.
Some of you may be taking psychiatric home-visit nursing care, and some of you may be thinking about receiving it.
Visiting nursing is very helpful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, I will accept it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I was unable to agree with the warp, and I have canceled my contract from here.
Sorry for the bad.
I know it's a false warning, but I came out in English and was scared.
Why do you come out in English?

・Difference of language judgment
・Your browser settings are given priority to English.

South Korea's Hydrogen Technology Patent, One-fifth of China's ... "Lagging behind in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap" (Chuo Nippo) - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government released a hydrogen economy roadmap in 2019.
By 2022, the company had expanded its fuel cell vehicles to sixty-five thousand units (cumulatively) and operated three hundred and thirty hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was 6000won (about 577yen) per kilo.
However, on a November basis this year, fuel cell vehicles are only at the target level of 27 percent (approximately 17,000 units).
The target is 38 percent (about 117 locations) for the spread of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure, and the price of hydrogen per kilometre is not much different from the time the roadmap was announced.
It turned out that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap was significantly below the target.
The National Federation of Economic Peoples (Zenkeiren) released a report on the "Current status and policy direction of the hydrogen economy ecosystem".
According to the report, the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry are mostly dependent on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), membrane membranes by DuPont (U.S.), Goa (U.S.A.), and 3M (U.S.).
The number of patents on hydrogen technology in the six countries that lead the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14 percent a year (since 2014).
South Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the hydrogen production and fuel cell fields (2014-2020 cumulatively).
However, the Zenkeiren reported that "de facto six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, and in fact it means that they are lower among the competing countries."
Patent ranking by country is in China, U.S., EU, and Japan.
Since China overtook the U.S. in first place, the gap has widened.
South Korea ranked fourth, surpassing Japan (974 cases) with 1033 patents in 2020, but it is at a level of 22 percent for China (4721 cases).
The Zenkeiren proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a "national strategic technology" with a large range of capital investment and R&D expenses tax credits.

Congress on Sunday?
, Making a flyer like a TV program In the process of parliamentary reform in Takasu, the "communication book" of the legislator is also: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
[Takasu] The town council is working on a unique parliamentary reform, such as creating a strange flyer to guide the regular meeting and introducing a "communication book" that evaluates the townspeople to legislators.
The town council election is the third consecutive consecutive no-vote, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
In order to inform the Sunday Assembly held on the 12th, about 1800 new leaflets were distributed in newspaper folding on the 9th.
"From the morning raw guilon" "Tetsuko's room" "Sawaguchi Hitoshi exploration series" ... .
The flyer that the town council distributed to all the houses on the 9th is a word reminiscent of the name of a popular TV program.

U.S., Aid Weapons and Ammunition Arrive in Ukraine, Engaged in Troop Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) -- U.S. State Department officials reported earlier in the day that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security aid plan approved by President Biden.
The total amount of military aid is equivalent to $60m, and at the beginning of the year, the last equipment, including four radars that identify launch sites such as mortars, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kirby, these aids included lethal weapons such as the anti-tank missile "javelin."
The purpose of the military support is to strengthen Ukraine's national defense capabilities, which have been supported by Russian forces, such as the increase in troop forces around the Ukrainian border.
The U.S. is also wary of Russian military moves, in talks with NATO members, and plans to respond if Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden had approved weapons aid on September 1 this year when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House.
U.S. military support for Ukraine reached nearly $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forced annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula, the total amount of aid has risen to more than $25 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training operations for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, in accordance with a multilateral joint training plan to support Ukraine, the U.S. National Guard of Florida was sent.
According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Defense, European Special Operations Forces also play a major role in the training and advice of Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been revealed as a secret matter in the course of operations.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense exchanges in the situation in Ukraine.
The U.S. is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The future of inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes the gift of life "forbidden", Amari Akira · former tax chairman of the LDP direct hit!
The first feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking to my family at the end of the year and the New Year!
It is a gift and inheritance.”
As the discussion of the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax progresses, it was postponed in the tax reform outline of FY2022, which was a concern, but in the near future, there is a great possibility that the lifetime gift, which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures, will become a "forbidden hand".
How will the rules of inheritance change?
Along with a direct hit on the former chairman of the LDP and Mr. Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives, we will teach them all the time from the basic gift and inheritance basic to tax-saving techniques that will be in time for the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Hiroaki Miyahara )
From assets to employees in urban areas "From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax more integrated, we will proceed with full-scale consideration toward the establishment of a tax system that is neutral on the selection of the time of asset transfer."
In a statement released by the ruling party last year on the outline of the tax reform for FY2021, a great upheaval spread not only to wealthy people but also to the middle class.
This is because what we are not saying is that we will change the rules of inheritance and raise the inheritance tax by making the "lifetime gift" which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures a "forbidden hand".
The iron rule for saving taxes on inheritance tax with a high degree of progressiveness is to "reduce the amount of property subject to taxation."
The most powerful trump card, the lifetime gift, has been widely used not only by wealthy people, but also by company employees who have a small inheritance tax due to having a home in three major metropolitan areas.
In such a situation, the discussion of "interrietory tax and gift tax integration" that came up.
Although it was postponed in the FY22 tax revision outline announced on December 10th, which was announced on December 10th, which was concerned about the introduction of the fastest, the policy for integration was once again hammered out with more in-depth words such as “We will review the current inheritance settlement tax system and the calendar year gift system” and “Since the tax-exempt measures of gift tax do not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit ...
In an interview with the editorial department, former LDP chairman of the tax investigation and former secretary general Akira Amari said.
"It is most important to lose the advantage and disadvantage due to the time of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same whenever you go.
At present, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise (depending on integration)."If it is the fastest revision, the opportunity for the lifetime gift left is three times remaining.
Even if it is not so, it is unlikely that it will be cut significantly in the direction of invalidating the lifetime gift as a tax saving measure in the near future.
So how do inheritance and gift tax rules change?

"My Right Brother" 2022From January 10th, 2022, terrestrial broadcaster Yudai Furukawa "Please look forward to it!"
The FOD original drama "My Right Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10th.
[Photo] Hanazumi Yamatani as the heroine This work is based on the manga of the same name by Toshi Moriesa, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE · LOVE" since 2018, and is a pure love story that is too sad for men and women who have carried the past.
The main character, Umi, is served by Furukawa, and the heroine, Riyo, is played by Hanazumi YAMATANI.
Risei, a university student, meets a senior who is working part-time, Kairi.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly when he borrows the shoulders of the world for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to the sea interest that resembles her brother, who has survived due to the divorce of her parents, but isn't it because of a certain reason that she is a murderer?
・Yudai Furukawa's comment Drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial from January 10th!
I would like people who could not see it in FOD to look forward to it, and I think that those who have already seen it will be able to learn more about this work if they can see the complicated psychological depiction of the sea and the world, and the situation of the two who are conflicting and changing.
I hope the original fans will enjoy it too.
Please look forward to it!

The team that won three passes in one game How did the players feel (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this match, Jones threw a pass-pay-the-playing pass only three times.
This was the second few time in the NFL in the past 50 years, when the Bills had recorded two passes against the New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
The 1974 bill was the first in the previous season to have an unborn genius named O.J. Simpson, who surpassed the season 2000 yards.
Bills overpowered the Jets with Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton run.
The main reason why the Patriots developed this kind of extreme defense was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and at latitude it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was around one degree Celsius, and the wind was 18m high, and there was a blizzard before the game.
Bills was only local and didn't change much of his choice of play.
Twenty-five runs against the 30th pass.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and it was never possible.
There were four red zone intrusions in the 10-off series and a scoring machine.
Especially after the end of the 3rd Q, I advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, I was able to take only three points of FG in three innings.
The defense in front of the goal in the final game.
Bills, who trailed by four points, penalized for 3rd & 9, making it 3rd & 14.
Eighteen yards to the goal.
QB Allen in 3rd & 14th, surrounded by the Patriots defense rush, came out of the pocket and flowed to the right.
He threw a pass at the end-zone TE Dawson Knox, but failed.
In this play, the ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was outside the right, ran a shalo-a-cross and was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that it did not enter Allen's eyes.
On 4th & 18th, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran from the left in the end zone, but the pass was beaten by the Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in the foreground and ended in failure.
Bryant had a one-on-one cover of Bills' WR Cole Beasley, but he saw Allen's move on the way and released Beasley and reacted to the pass.
Allen, who missed the two receivers, threw a pass at the end zone in both innings.
The 4th down pass may have been a deciding streak, but the 3rd down didn't have to aim for the TD.
Take the first down in two games.
It was still before the 2nd minute, so if it had been 4th & short, Allen's ability with his own run would have lived.

It's time to "dispose" & "replacement time", three items that tend to be placed in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it is probably a sponge that does not replace it as often as recommended.
According to a study, kitchen sponges are found to grow a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
German researchers who conducted the study recommend that sponges be replaced once a week to keep them clean.
cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pointed out that when it starts to rubberish, scratches and grooves, the cutting board should be replaced.
Once the wounds and grooves progress, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, and bacteria grow.
If it is still okay, do not forget to disinfect it frequently with a solution with a tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach in one gallon (about three and a half liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the liquid cutting board and put for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, dry naturally or dry with a clean paper towel to drain and dry it so that it is lightly pit.
Chip or cracked tableware
Disposing of your favorite mug may hurt your chest, but the missing surface is a new hotbed of bacteria and germs.
In addition, it can also cause the lips to be cut off with missing parts and drinks to spill.
Yes, it's your chance to buy a new favorite mug!

I’m embarrassed to have a brand.
If it is an inconspicuous thing, I can have it, but I can not have it written Lv in a monogram like Vuitton.
Why is it?
I think it would be nice to fit your height.
By the way, in Japan, I think it is good.
If it is Japan . . .
It has nothing to do with the gaijin wind.
You better tell them early, “Why am I just calling you out?”
So it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner? If you come up, it's better to simply say that it's uncomfortable.
I don't think you'd dream of being uncomfortable with a good chance.
I was living abroad on the way, but the Japanese who went outside, including me, had a lot of people who came because they didn't like the Confucianism of the top and bottom, and there were people who came out of the tag, and I misunderstood that I could say anything to the local people.
If you look like a Westerner, I think that there is no pure offense, and I do it with a kind of spoiling or a friendly feeling.
If it was a friend of mine or a Westerner, I would call him by the name below, but when I speak in Japanese, I sometimes have a moment when I get a little lost.
Well, if you're a friend, it's still good.
Originally, it may be purely normal, but if you overlook it, it may not be effective to stop it because it is a gaijin, so it is better to say it now.
Because it is Japan, can you talk about Japanese rules?
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always make the glass higher than other younger people when they toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good custom because if you do that, you can't be strangely snacked by younger or older people, or you can treat it like a Japanese.
Japanese people, regardless of their character, are shitty people (including me) who look at such details

Well, please throw it in the water!
I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I will judge only by the translated text.
The translated text feels a little uncomfortable in the text, but I understand what I want to convey, and I think that it is a level that does not interfere with the amount of playing (I think it is better to ask others just by feeling this)
I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and I feel that it is a well-translated person if it is a small company.
I think that people who are not native Japanese can understand the differences in the nuances of Japanese even if they study for a long time.
I don’t know how much level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people do not feel uncomfortable, I think it is good to look for other people.

Discussion "The Blade of Destruction" training is the battle.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human hymn <Anime "Yukaku" start commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among the recent boys' comics, "The Blade of Onishu" is particularly different from that of "Ascetic training is very much."
In most cases, there is no battle, and it is a common theory that the readership is not popular in the training hen that trains are done both dawn and night.
Even in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, they practiced for two years, but they only drew the touch and the rest were blown away vigorously, so you should also know it by pushing it.
Well, one of the charms of Wampi is the eccentricity of the land that passes through, and "stay in the same place and practice" may not be so compatible.
By the way, the training of Sumijiro, the main character of "The Blade of Destruction", sat down on the ground by Yoshikazu Tomioka, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take her own life, "Don't let others take the right to kill and take life! You can say that it started with what was said to you by volunteers.
The weak have no rights or choices, only the strong can be screwed down by all forces ... ... .
With that in mind, I introduced Sakonji Sakitaki, a "student" who trains those who want to join the Oni-satsutai, and the kindness of Yoshikazu (a good-natured commu who does not explain his intention).
The first contact between Sumijiro and Sakitaki was asked, “What do you do when your sister eats people?” and a shot was fired against Sumijiro, who was stuck in the answer, saying, “The judgment is slow.”
It is an unreasonable exchange at first glance, even among the fans.
However, taking a sister who has become an ogre has the possibility that the moment will come when such a judgment is forced.
It can be said that it is an initiation to enter the training from the attitude.
However, Sabi-takiru tells her to take Sumijiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, to the mountain and tell him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is full of traps, pits, stone machines, and traps, and they are about to die before they enter training.
Even so, it is barely "the main character correction" to sniff out the faint smell of the trap that was sprinkled by hand with the sharp sense of smell.
And yet, "That's why I don't suddenly have a higher physical ability than if I could suddenly avoid it all! What Sumijiro says is the essence of demonic destruction.
Ordinary people do not have any endorsements and do not suddenly become stronger, and the only thing that awakens is that they can use "the power and skill that has been polished up until then" with their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort" that rewards the person who made the effort, and probably rewards nothing, is a human hymn that is different from the demon that has unfounded supernatural power, and it is an unmovable rule consistent with this work.

Samsung Electronics, South Korea, has established a new "DX department" that integrates home appliances and mobile devices, "emphasizing user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of the CE and IM divisions as a set division, Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it will decide on the name DX (Device eXperience) and reflect it in the year-end reorganization.
It can be read that the purpose of strengthening user experience (experience) through various services from mobile to home appliances can be read.
Samsung Electronics said that the newly established DX division, which was launched by integrating the CE and IM divisions, will consist of divisions such as VD (Visual Display), Consumer Electronics, Medical Devices, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Network.
A Samsung Electronics official said, “This name change reflects the medium- to long-term business structure, future-orientedness, and strengthening of global leadership.”
In addition to products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, he emphasized the intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience through service solutions that reflect customer needs.
With the establishment of an integrated leadership system, the strategy of creating synergies across organizations and building a foundation for products and services that are differentiated from the company-wide scale was also reflected in the name.
Already, Samsung Electronics is envisioning a strategy to make content and services freely available to users through interlocking devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), through the Multi-Device Experience Council.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics 4th Edition] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started with three volumes, are completed in these four volumes!
In contrast to the previous volume, which drew the opening to the semifinals at once, we focused only on one game, but it is full of new devices!
●"Kinnikuman" volume4 review contributor name Oginuma X★★★★★★(5 out of five stars) ●Superhuman professional wrestling has already started before the game!
In a word, this four-volume book is a book that carefully and carefully depicts the final match between Kinnikuman vs. Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to hold down is that it is not a volume that depicts only the match on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, it is difficult to go to the game, such as the battle and special training scenery of each other, but it is never boring.
This feeling of the work, where the tension of the first battle of the century is finally beginning, is surely connected to the increase in the tension of the reader, and I am impressed that this period is also a really calculated production.
And one more mountain before the important final, what can not be missed is the third place decider of Terry Man vs. Ramen Man.
In addition to the luxury as a match card, I like the fact that before the game, Ramenman turned to the poster of Kinnikuman to "It's my turn from now on!"
And try to beat the chops.
However, Terryman who happened to pass by accepted the sword and stopped it, and they stared at each other silently, and the scene was just a scene where they separated by it.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been defeated, and there is no longer an opportunity to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a thing as a shambles about that kinnikuman.
If you can show me this, I can not help but think about the activities of the distant future!
This is what it is like to stand up to the character, and it is a scene that I can still keenly feel as a manga artist!
The battle between the two ends without cutting the shaku so much, but the famous scene is a tearful appeal of the ramen man after the game.
To Kinnikuman, "Don't be alone with the strength of God's luck!"
It's a line.
This is already a grand meta statement on the work itself, and I think that the reader has felt that Kinnikuman is somehow winning in a place where he is not the main character and does not lose because he is the main character.
However, by making this statement by Ramenman, Mr. Boyedama was able to put his hand on it and sting it in a kugi.
In this one word, the reader said, "Well, then, Kinnikuman will defeat Robin with his ability?
How?" "
You will be able to imagine again with the invisible development of the future, and from another artist's point of view, this is a line that the boiled egg teacher who makes the work has imposed on himself.
I thought this was a great thing.
I think it's definitely one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Aobayama, Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, winter illuminations have begun for the first time, and the park is enveloped in a gentle light.
The winter illuminations, which began on November 26th, are littered with 50,000 LED bulbs according to the walking path and lawn, including a 20-meter-high camphor.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I was surprised to see Fukui's people come for the first time in a long time and there was such a place.
It was so beautiful and I was relieved.”
The illuminations are planned for the first time to feel healing while avoiding secrecy, and they are lit from 5pm to 8:30pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
Also, on the 25th of the last day, as a Christmas event, the behavior of the button pot and the screening of the movie will be held.

Online distribution, agricultural and livestock products PR Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, broadcast from Yonezawa|Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of cities and towns in the Okitama area and JA, carried out PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce" that sells products while distributing videos on the Internet.
The Yamatoai no Washotai performed remotely on the first "National Cooperation MINATO Market TV" planned by Minato-ku, Tokyo, and delivered the charm of the region along with local specialties.
The "Okitama × Minato Port Opening Project", an initiative that the Okitama area and Minato Ward cooperated, was decided to open a store due to the relationship, and it was broadcast from Satoyama Vision House in Minamihara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mr. Mika Kuroda, who is active as a "Satoyama sommelier", introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature wearing the stall of the Yonezawa textile brand "nitorito".
He also delivered the state of the Imoni-kai with the Ai no Bushotai.
In the studio in Tokyo, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo "Tanpopo" and YouTubers who have more than three hundred thousand registrants sampled Okitama's local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, etc.
When I told the audience about the deliciousness, I received comments such as "The smell is transmitted even though it is distributed" and "There are many delicious things in sake and it is the best".

I'm more unhappy this morning...
The PC for NAS is no longer turned on 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What happened...
1.) In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is in power.
2.) When I returned to the room after a while, I noticed that there was a sound like a pink rotor from the PC, but I shut down for the time being.
At this point, I thought that the room temperature drop (6°C) only made the fan move worse.
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Without activation.
The power lamp is attached to the power lamp for a moment when the power button is pressed, and the fan also moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I won’t say much.
I pull out the power plug and try again, but it only takes a moment.
4.) Connect only the motherboard with the ATX20 pin and 4 pins, remove the other parts, and try it, but do not start.
5.) It seems that PSU fans have been hitting something for a long time, and there was a sound of bubbabbububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububububu
I will try to find the ATX power supply that is left over later.
Maybe.
If not, what should I do?

Overall, positive and bright emojis are ranked.
According to Unicode, ninety-two percent of the world’s Internet population uses emoji.
The first one is that it accounts for five percent of all emoji usage rates!
The first, third, and fifth-placed crying laughter emojis are very easy to use.
When it was fun, I did it when I was happy!
There are few people who use it self-deprecatingly even when they feel that it can not be done at any time or in any way.
On the other hand, people who have never used a single top ten emoji are rare in rare.
I want you to follow that style.
