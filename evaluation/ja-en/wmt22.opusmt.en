Do you think the entertainer's out of control? He's just an entertainer.
Yesterday at Netflix, I saw a thousand birds, but there are a lot of scenes where the staff giggle in the back when they're saying something that's not particularly interesting.
It's definitely not interesting, but it's not creepy to laugh at everything you say because you're a successful entertainer.
But if you don't laugh at me, I'm afraid the entertainer's mood is upset and I don't feel comfortable with my work.
Like the old black company, that industry looks like a gym club, and some entertainers' egos seem to go too far and act like normal attitudes, so I'm sure I'll have to eat them.
On the other hand, there are a lot of arguments that the entertainer's opinion is "Don't lick the entertainer" at the same time as he's making his work seem like he's making a lot of money.
I know my income is pretty low until I'm ready to sell, but even if a entertainer's job is at the top of the top of the line, it's as if he's at the top of the line.
It seems only to justify the beauty of their own careers and the fact that their position in media and society is too high.
To be honest, there are some parts of the industry that I work in, but I feel that the things I touch the entertainment world are getting harder and harder.
I'm sorry I complained.
I felt like if I didn't get out like a fart, it wouldn't be good for me.

A sample gift to the purchaser.
I've been replaced by a product I ordered at the Tuscannet Shop.
A summary: When I ordered a cheap radio mouse, the cabled version of the mouse came in and asked me to send it back if I wanted the money back.
It's not so much a self-made computer as a commercial problem, but it's really hard for me to think about, and I'm going to have to write this down because it's a famous place.
It was discovered that a MSI radio-guming mouse was selling at a Tweezer's day sale that started last Friday at a Tweet store.
I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to go and see if there's a linear page, because there's the same price, so I'm going to ask you for a chance it wasn't a mistake.
I got the order, and the next day I got the shipment.
In these two e-mails, and in the history of the purchase of My Pages, there was the name "CLUTCH GM41."
And the reason why I didn't have any mistakes or cancellations from order to shipment was that I thought at this point that the wireless mouse that I ordered would arrive.
It's not a problem. It's a problem. A few hours after the shipment, I got an email saying, "There was a mistake in registration of the product."
According to those e-mails,
* I was selling a radio version for sale, but it was actually a commercial version.
(Laughter)

They've got a separate product page of wire and wireless, and they've got a wireless version of the purchase history, e-mails, and receipts, but they've been able to re-send them to the cable formats.
Isn't it awful to be sent back to you without accepting what you bought and returning it to you if you want it back?
I want you to lend me your wisdom because I want to fight back if I want to finally accept the money back.
Do you think that if you were married or you were looking for a partner, you wouldn't want to associate with someone who wasn't at home?
Or is it none of your business?
If you care, why is that?
For example, people who are separated from their parents or brothers and sisters.
I don't care.
The problem is that both parents and siblings have different personalities and unreasonable people.

Mr. Matsumoto-kun of the Highland District of Fukushima prefecture.
It was the east Japanese typhoon of 1920 that had a profound impact on the lives of three families of eight people.
"It's like, "Are you serious at first?"
"It was as if the only road to the Highland District was to be swept along by an East Japanese typhoon, leaving 30 families in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced out of water continued to carry their supplies by using JR's bridge, which is not normally allowed.
Matsumoto-Joo: "The car usually comes to the garden, but when you get out of the car, you hold it in your hand, or you walk over the bridge, and you carry it around, and you feel the thanks of the car."
After more than two years of recovery from the disaster, Matsumoto-san continues to act as a reminder.

So in the year 2018, the Ministry of Travel started a survey of buildings designed to change some of the country's building trading laws, securely and securely, and so on, of what is called Inspection: / /www. mlit. go. emails / common / 0012.90.50.fff.)
This is a system in which architects who are well versed in housing, check the condition of buildings, including the degradation of property, and present them to the buyer in a report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that introspection benefits both buyers and sellers.
It's because the sellers can avoid the resulting malm by doing the property research before the sale and give the buyer a sense of security.
It's said that it also leads to discrimination in competitions.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it's a system where he can figure out the state of the old house he's going to buy, and it's a system that he can be persuaded to buy, and it's a system that is of great benefit at first glance.
It is mainly the sellers who have the initiative to investigate buildings in the system of this system.
In addition, I want to note that only the notice of the institution called Insulation has been made obligatory.
In other words, the agency's real estate agent is obliged to explain that "I can't do building research" or "I can't do that," but the operation itself is not compulsory.
● The risk of being concerned about the instigation of sellers, while turning abroad, and even in the United States and Great Britain, where used markets are active, there are already similar institutions.
It's a system in the early stages of the house sale where the buyer asks a specialist called "Inspector" or " Building Survey" to investigate buildings.
In the United States, for example, in the case of the U.S., there is an incredulity at 70 percent of the level of the used housing trade.
In the sense that the buyer takes the lead and performs an insulation, the Japanese brands are very different in nature from the Japanese brand.
The sellers will show you some of the building's conditions and try to sell them as high and as fast as they can.
The buyer, on the other hand, thinks he wants to live in peace with his research and with proper repairs.
Even if it's the same injection, there's a difference between the purpose and the mind of both parties.
For this reason, the following points are pointed out about Japan's system as the risk to be concerned:
● The scope of the nation's sales initiatives is limited to a minimum.
It's not a detailed investigation, so there's a risk of missing a really important defect.
And that's why they don't report negative results to the sellers.

Ginza was an island?
(Yahoo!)
"This was an old Peninsula.
In light of that evidence, I'll be able to show you a little bit of art if Ginza is the only one who's able to do it.
I'd like to introduce you to Ginza's knowledge of beans.
Over Ginza!
The first time I went undercover in the Golden Table.
Walking along the Ginza, you will find that the strange names, the mysterious stela, the many companies, and the historical shadows of the land of Ginza have been carved.
I was walking along Ginza with her, and I was surprised to find a silence saying, "This was an old Peninsula.
Ginza was once a peninsula?
The nickname used by many Japanese people for "○ Ginza" is "Ginza" in Tokyo's central district.
In the first place, "Ginza" refers to a silver casting plant, so in 1612, the Ginza hall, located in what is now Shizuoka City, was transferred to Edo.
At the time, he used to call it "a new money town," but when he was transferred to Tsunami, he came to be called by the common name "Ginza."
By the way, once it was said that near Ginza, it was the Peninsula that came out into the sea.
Up until the Edo period, the coves had entered the valley from the Sundo Valley to within the circle, and the Peninsula had been extended from Japan Bridge to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula covers the present Ginza.
When the Tokugawas opened the condo in Edo, they buried the coves and organized the Kyobashi District.
The house also managed to build up the city area and build the ship's ships.
Then we cut down the ground and the mountains of Kanda and buried the coves.
Why don't we look for an interesting direction, as there's a stela that shows the site of Ginza's palace around the corner?
I don't know. A pilgrimage to the Holy Land of Ginza.
Ginza has an annual pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
Of the more than ten shrines, the most visible of them will be the Kabuki Kabuki Kabuki, in front of Kabuki.
Not many of the companies standing at the right end of Kabuki will come before and after the spectacle.
On the other hand, the "dragonless value" is the roof of the Ginza pine shop, the "geoge of success" is on the silver terrace of the 3rd and 9th floors of Ginza.
The "Surprising Supplies" and the "City of Japan" are in the back of the alley, hard to see, but the "Magniture of Japan" is known for the reverence of Kabuki's famous City of Japan's Toshigi Toshigi, and the "Saigit of Japan" in the 1F Transway is open to the public only when it comes to the Kaji God-do.
Although this shrine includes an impregnable king and accumulator, most shrines are altar gods.
The "Foundry" to which the fox is welcomed in front of the company's office was built in a small way, where there are many farmers, with the benefit of the well - riceed "Founda" plant.
It turned out that in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, there was a profit in business, and even Japan's best downtown Ginza and faith became popular.

The Posco International announced that 12 days later, they had signed a stock contract for Seinex Energy (Senex Energy) and an investment agreement for the Senex Energy (Hungsy) and Seinex Energy.
At present, there are still procedures for voting and recognition by local lawmen at Seinex Enazie's company council, and the buy-out process will be completed in March next year.
This is a case where the Posco International has been integrated into the Posco Group since 2010.
The bribe was 779 billion dollars, and of these, the Posco International decided to invest 50.1 percent, and Hancock Energy 49.9 percent.
The Posco International explained that even during the energy shift period, natural gas demand continued to increase, and that blue hydrogen, based on natural gas, splits the market with green hydrogen, and decided to buy this.
The Posco International is going to buy out the amount of natural gas stored in 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf), equivalent to 44 percent of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as the surface gas service in the state of the state.

The pain in her knee, maybe it's "formation knee."
(Medical DOC for different causes) - Yahoo! News!
Editing section: Recently, I've been suffering from knee pain.
What possible disease?
Fukuyama: The causes of knee pain include injuries, arthritis, pain attacks, and so on.
Of all the Japanese people, the most common form of osteoarthritis is osteoarthritis.
What does that mean? &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Narrator:
Ms. Nakayama: That's right.
Normally, the surface of the joint is covered with abrasives, and it serves to ease the impact and smooth the joint's movements.
However, age, obesity, and heavy sports can cause abrasion and distortion of the bones.
As a result, it leads to joint deformation and inflammation.
It's called osteoarthritis. It's called osteoarthritis. It's called osteoarthritis. It's called osteoarthritis. It's called osteoarthritis. It's called osteoarthritis.
Ms. Nakayama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joint of the fingers, the joint of the fingers, the neck, the hip, the thumb of the foot, and the hip.
However, the most common case in the knee is called deformating knee syndrome.
What's the structure of a joint in the first place?
Ms. Nakayama: The joint has two bones that fit together to the fold.
And the part where these two meet is covered with a "treasure." The area around the joint is covered with an "treasure."
It's a complex structure, isn't it?
Jeiyama: That's right.
The inner layer of the joint follicles has a tissue called the diaphragm and produces an arteriosclerosis.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant, and is made up of hydrolyn acid and condensate sulfuric acid.
That's why we're told, "Smooth hydrocarbons and peroxide are good for smoothing knee movements."
What symptoms do you have when you have osteoarthritis? &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Exactly. &gt;&gt;Narrator:
Fongyama: The arthritic arthritic is sticky and elastic and serves as a way to keep bones and bones from directly bumping into one another.
It's like a cushion, as it were.
However, if this is worn or distorted, it can cause pain by changing the joints or by causing an inflammation.

It's a series of compulsive comics that are so popular with men.
One of the chrysanthemums of the book is a life-threatening limit game.
I can't stand looking at a picture of you, but I'm going to try to cross the bone!
So this time I'd like to test the game of Qizi that can actually be played, or that's being played in a project video.
▪ The swamp with the trappful pachinko in "The Gambling Book."
In its original composition, he was surprised at the high rate of 4000 yen per ball.
This swamp had a large trap set up in the nail forest, a moving object, and a three-step crumb, making it almost impossible to attack.
However, he did all he could, and eventually he went into the rough business of putting a plastic tank on the building and sinking the earth down.
The swamp that appeared in the Kaiji actually appears as pachinko and is played by many people.
Of course, it doesn't have to be like "4000 yen per pound" but it's also reduced to a difficulty level, but you'll be able to taste the mood of the circadian.
▪ At the Starside Party, held by the rich as a entertainment event, the debt holder, including Qizi, was forced to go through the steel of the Human Race.
The borrower worked hard not to fall on the thin steel set up ten meters above the ground, and competed for its speed.
Twelve people will participate, two of them will be able to win the prize, but there are only four steels, and there are not enough safety measures, and there is a good chance that they will die.
In addition to the high risk of bone travel, which has been developed as a VR game, you can experience an extremely close experience at the Eagle Bridge, set up at the home of the Pro-Boo and the Golden Eagles.
The Eagle Bridge has a single steel bridge at the point of a 20-foot building seven-story height, with Sky Blanco and the One-Wake of Victory ready and on foot.
Of course, safety measures have been taken.
The joker's core storm was released and talked about as an "Europe Can Experience in Japan" on its own YouTube.
▪ E-card games and "E-cards" games.
I play with one of the emperor's cards, eight of the citizens, 10 of the slaves, 10 of the emperor's cards, and 10 of the emperor's cards.
This game is so good that it has the characteristics that the emperor is strong for the citizens, the people are strong for the slaves, and the slaves are strong for the emperor.
In a play, Kaiji competes with Tokugawa with a strict rule: "If you lose, you can cut off your ears."
When he realized that the machine that destroys ears, like an earphone on his ear, detects pulse rate, temperature changes, and so on, and reads psychology through transmission, he confused the river by crushing his ears to the limit.
E-cards are sold on the market, and you can buy them in Amazon and so on.
On YouTube, a popular YouTube hiccups played the scene in a movie where they made video games with Fujiga Yata and E-card, and they talked about it.

What kind of town was it in 2030?
A student representative of the 4th school in Tamano City is working on a workshop that thinks of "I want to continue living."
In part of the research and policy proposals of the Mid-SDG Building, I'd like to present the voice of young people to the mayor.
"When are you having fun?"
To the Fasitetor's question, the student answers, "When you're up with a lot of people," and "when you're beating drums."
The first time held on November 13th in the sunroom.
18 high school students and people from the community thought of "The World Café" as a way to talk about each subject as they moved around the island, "The World Café" as a way to talk about "The Good Town" and "The Good Town" as a place to live."
Each idea is written on a note, put it on a forged paper, and put it away.
Traffic such as trains and buses is essential to the convenience of living in a city where there are so many young people.
Do we have anything in common? We'll talk more about it.
I thought Hito was boring, but it's attractive to bike the beach.
It's like, "There's not much in the store, there's no traffic, but there's no natural abundance." And adults talk about it, and they've noticed not only the problems of the community, but also the charm.
The second time in December, only high school students get together and organize the proposal.
We're going to invite the mayor and principals to come forward next February.
The Eastern director of the center says, "As soon as you develop the native love of high school students, it will be a major cause of young people's involvement in creating them."

I wish I could look in the mirror after I roll it, but sometimes I hear a voice saying that I don't know what to do.
I had hoped that if there was a stove that didn't have the cloth to hold and roll, I'd find something new.
The brand of "COTTORIC" has a height of about three feet and a scale of about one meter above the general one.
When I first saw it, I said, "Can you roll it so short?"
When I look closely, I see that a long, cut cloth is woven into one piece, and the whole net is the pattern of the net.
To the eye of the net, the edge of the net is allowed to pass through.
So you can wrap and hold the edges together without having to tie them together.

This is Peter Jackson. He's a Get Buck.
It's kind of raw, like the E.T.S., and it's all fresh...
It's just before the break up, so I'm doing this, but I don't think it's dramatic.
Like, "I know I'm bothering you" or "I know I'm bothering you" or "I know it's bothering you" or "I'm really slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or "I'm slow" or something.
We don't hate each other so much as fighting each other, but we feel like we can't work together anymore.
(Laughter)
It's a little bit of a phrase, and as we're asking each other, "What do you think of this?" it's not going to work, but it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's going to work, it's not going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work, it's going to work.

It's a story that's still being told in three talks, but at the moment, the biggest cause of the breakup was the impression that it wasn't the Rogers itself that was the environment that was the biggest cause of the breakup.
I mean, the four of you are going to be happy when they start making songs, but when they start making songs, they're going to be happy when they're talking about where they're going to live, and they're going to be like, "What are you going to do?" and they're like, "Oh, the beats are coming from the world's best!" and they're going to be like, "Oh, they're getting away from the world!" and I could see that they're getting away from their hands.
Well, documentaries can be interpreted by the director, so Peter Jackson might have felt that way.

If you don't call me "skill" before you give me your skills,
I was sure they had a serious personality, so I felt responsible and couldn't afford it anymore.
I think it's a good idea to live a little bit now, isn't it?
I was sick to death of my job, but at the time I didn't like my own business activities, but I thought I was pretty good at the kind of business that customers needed, so I was very good at it, so it became very easy for me to choose such a job and get a job.
You said you couldn't do something, but finding something you can do or do with yourself will make your future life a little easier.
Of course, I think it's okay to think about this after taking a rest and settling down.
I think there's just a daily life, so if there's a company union or an industrial doctor or a window where you can talk to them, it might be a good idea to consult with them once.
I hope I can live with a little more ease from now on.

The Osaka Metro Central Station, Takada Station, five minutes.
The damage that has been caused in the U.S. has been devastating, especially since the end of World War II, the effects of the out-of-season warmth and the intense cold.
Between the 10th and 11th days of local time, there were a lot of tornados in the south of the United States.
At this time of the year, it seems that the effects of a severe cold below the record warmth caused the atmosphere to become very unstable and the flood clouds to develop rapidly.
The warm air coming from the southwest of the United States has turned into a record high temperature.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature of nine days of local time and ten days of gold is up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
We've come down from a severe cold south, near 5500 feet above the record, so great temperatures have created an active front, and condensation clouds are rapidly developing in such a way as to follow the front.
It is estimated that a tornado broke out in the surrounding area.
The southern part of the United States is originally prone to tornados, but the high season between first summer and summers is not the case in many cases of major damage during this time of year.
The tornado alarm, announced one day in winter, reached close to 150 times and was recorded with many.
The U.S. Oceanic Aerospace Agency reported more than 400 tornados and hurricanes in just ten days of local time alone.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas between the south line from Kentucky to Texas and the north line, including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale, which shows the strength of a tornado, reached the third of the six stages from the stronger to the third, and it is believed that the 70m/synthetic winds were blowing at once.
Based on future research, it is possible to be identified as EF4c5.
In Japan, JEFs are used based on improved Fujita scale, such as in Japanese architecture.
The JEF3 equivalent of this American tornado is enough to happen in Japan, and the level at which wooden houses collapse.

The President of the United States, as regards the damage to the U.S. and the mid-west, and the South, came up with a divine view, "One of the biggest tornados in U.S. history."
The U.S.
Mr. Vaden emphasizes that as a federal government, he will do everything.
I explained that I still don't know the total damage, including how many lives were lost.
There's been more than 100 deaths.
In Kentucky, a resident who carried household goods and other items from broken houses 10 to 11 days ago, the state of Kentucky had more than 30 tornados in at least six states.
Although the damage to the tornado was recorded in 1955 in Missouri and other places, weather experts at the United States CN also calculated that it was the largest in size this time.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, where the damage was great, the candle factory, which had been operating 24 hours in preparation for the Christmas season, was also severely damaged.
There were 110 people on duty at the time, but the building was destroyed and no trace of it was found.
A woman who was paralyzed in the dark under a thick bush about three and a half feet thick felt the weight of a rescuer searching for it, so from her phone she asked for help on a live Facebook broadcast.
In addition to the cries of women calling for help, the live broadcast also heard the song "Happy Birthday To You," which is supposed to be sung in order to distract fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, was safe in his five-year-old son and his basement as a result of a tornado alert.
I looked back and I thought, "Many people are like the sound of a train, but it was like the sound of something more coming out of the ground."
The Mayfield police officer said, "The search operation will continue until it's no longer necessary.
"I don't know if it'll be weeks, months, or years," I continued my efforts to save them.
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead as part of a warehouse in the Internet Amazon.
The roadblocks are paralleled by such effects as derailing the train's vehicle and falling over the highway.
According to the U.S. Web media, some 400,000 homes in Tennessee are out of control.

It's an old saying that it's a different way of thinking about the star system.
While foreign countries go down from there on the basis of five stars, Japan claims to keep three stars neutral, adding or subtracting them.
There's a difference between two stars at the point of reference point, and four stars have a "there's a point element" and "not a masterpiece," which makes a completely different sense.
I think it's a fault on a system that doesn't give the meaning of a star, but I'm asking you not to put three stars on the basis of that system.

"Hakobuon" by the newspaper L'Ive, "The Daily News" by Hakobu"Handon""Flow in the vicinity of the sea with his own sea-fished tartar saucer. "Liv. "
"Friends and shrimps from the time they were caught in the Near Sea."
It's called "Hakobuune," which specializes in taking out the colorful lunches and religiosity of vegetables that we use more and more.
The couple opened last August.
One of the popular menus for lunches is "Friends and Flies Made at the time caught in the Near Sea."
Fish choose which are good at times in the market.
"Fly keeps bread powder as thin as possible so that you can understand the texture of the material."
There are about four kinds of vegetables and deli added to the lunches, and as soon as rice is cooked and soup is served in the rice from the Saga prefecture.
Vegetables were prepared at home in the fields nearby or in the local resale.
The side-plants change at different times, but you have a French apprenticeship, which adds color to such things as rapes and latteuil.

And I thought, well, it's safe, because it's safe to be around people who slow down, and sometimes it's completely stopped, and I think it's safe, but I think it's dangerous in some places.
It's nice to be seen, to be around, to be seen, to be seen, to be in the way, but it's a pain to be seen, it's a pain to be in the way, it's a pain to be in the way, it's a pain to be in the way, it's a pain to be in the way, it's a pain to be in the way, it's a pain to be in the world, it's a pain to be in the world, it's a pain to be in the world, it's a pain to be in the world, it's a pain, it's a pain to be in the world, it's a pain to be in the world, it's a pain to be in the world, it's a pain to be in the world.

At about 1:25 a.m. on the 12th day, on the first street of Saga City, a 40-year-old man in Fukuoka was cut with a blade from a man considered to be a 40-year-old and injured in his face.
The man's on his bike, and the Saga's station's after him as a attempted murder attempt.
According to the south station, the passerby said he was fighting at 110.
The man was injured about 10 centimeters long on his left side, about one inch deep, but said he was conscious.
The man who ran away was medium meat and skinhead.
There was a blade that was thought to have been used for the crime near the scene.

My sister, Zhao, is now acting as an actress, Sesapana is a region bordering between Laos and Misammar two countries, and it is a region inhabited by many ethnic groups, including the Tae and Luuts of the kingdom of Thailand.
The river Mekong flows through Southeast Asia.
The area of Sesapana is only about 0.2 percent of China's total, but there are about 25 percent of wild animals and 20 percent of plants.
This time, I met Mr. Tsusepana, who conducts environmental activities on the site, and asked him to talk to me about what he was doing.
▪ I started environmental activities with my German husband. - It's been 20 years since I started environmental activities.
What was the start of it?
Miyagi-san, our environmental action has begun since 2000.
That's my husband, Joseph Malgraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Seasana for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is China's only tropical rain forest area, and it was proud of its great biodiversity.
But, on the other hand, economic development was even delayed.
Thus, large-scale deforestation of the rain forest has been advanced in the past, in order to create industry in this region and in order to produce the rubber that was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and to study biological resources.
And then I got married to someone I knew while I was a reporter here.
- Wasn't he interested in conservation before then?
I'm from Seasapana, but I wasn't interested in the importance of the rain forest or the meaning of biodiversity.
That's why I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
I don't have a perfect face, and I'm not particularly tall, but I look at people with auras from time to time, and why do you think?
A popular actor said.
Aura isn't something you want to put out.
The moment you feel confident about yourself, it's natural.
I'm sure that person has a strong, strong confidence inside.

It's not very detailed, is it?
I see it.
I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been told how to praise you in detail, so I don't know what you mean.
Did he give praise to you in detail?
What would you do if he confessed to you?
I'm going to go out with you and say, "I'm so happy that you've confessed to me and my heart is full of spring, and I'd like you to come with me."

When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that he's very hard at work, but he doesn't seem to be doing well.
But maybe he's a good mental man too.
I didn't retire in the name of Mental, but I think I was limited before retirement.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about the importance of mental health care.
I have bipolar disorder, and I've been in visiting nursing for a long time, but I think I've become acquainted with the hospital nurse I'm using and have a very good relationship with.
I talk a lot every week.
But above all, for those with mental illness, I felt the importance of pleasant communication in visiting nursing today.
Today we don't discuss and laugh about gender differences, like gender theories.
I'm going to talk about sexual desire between men and women, why she got divorced, and why I can't do that as a visiting nurse.
Sometimes, but sometimes I dress up as a woman.
But I've been told by an acquaintance that an aunt nurse, who can't work in a hospital where a mental hospital works, will come and do office work, and that she will tell you from the top, "I'm doing medical work."
I'm using a little visiting station run by Social Services, but I think it's a really good nurse who's going to face Frank as well as me with a mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful. Smile.
Some of you are receiving psychiatric visits, and some of you are thinking about receiving them.
Hospital care is very helpful to those with mental illness.
If the doctor will approve, I'll do it by all means.
And let's pick a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I wouldn't agree with each other, and in some places I removed the contract from us.

One fifth of Korea's hydrogen technology patents, and one fifth of China's nuclear economic road maps are late.
The Korean government released the hydrogen economy road map in 2019.
By 2022 we had made 65,000 fuel-powered cars available to run 310 hydrogen stations throughout the country.
The target hydrogen price was 6,000 won per kilo.
But this year, on November standards, fuel-powered cars are just the target's 27% level.
The central infrastructure's hydrogen station schedule is 38% of the target's time, and the price per kilo of hydrogen per kilo is 8400 won, which is not much different than at the time when it was announced.
The government's hydrogen economy map was found to be significantly below the target value.
In 12 days, the National Economic Union (the National Association of Economics) published a report entitled "America's Economics and Policy Orientation."
According to the report, the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry depend almost entirely on the United States and Japan.
The core carbon fiber of the fuel-powered car is supplied by the carbon fiber in the fuel-powered car, by the white cataracts in Japan, by the membrenium in the United States (U.S.A.), by Goa, by the U.S. (U.S.A.) and others (U.S.A.).
The number of hydrogen patents in six major countries leading the world's hydrogen market has increased from China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, Korea, and Germany to an annual average of 14% (after 2014).
The number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells is the fifth largest in the world.
But the generals said, "In fact, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market and actually mean the lower part of the competitive world."
The national patent order is in order of China, the U.S., the EU and Japan.
China has been in first place since 2017.
The number of patents registered in 2020 reached fourth place in Korea after 1033. But it's 22% of China 4721).
The whole series suggested that hydrogen technology should be classified as a " National Strategy Technologies" with a large disparity of investment and research and development tax.

The U.S. and U.S. military ammunition has arrived in Ukraine as well as military training.
(CN) The U.S. Department of Affairs reported that by the 12th, equipment containing firearms and ammunition had arrived in Ukraine, based on a security plan approved by President Baiden.
Military aid is equivalent to $60 million in total, and at the end of the year, the last equipment, including four radars, will be shipped to Ukraine, which will determine where to launch the mortars and other things.
According to the U.S. Department of Defense news officer Kirby, these aid included deadly weapons, such as the anti-car missile Javelin.
The purpose of military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense powers, such as the reinforcements that the Russians carry on around the border against Ukraine.
U.S. has been alert to Russian movements, has been consulting with members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and has been trying to figure out how to respond if Russia breaks through the invasion of Ukraine.
President Baden approved arms aid on September 1st this year when President Zellenski of Ukraine visited the U.S. White House.
The U.S. military support for Ukraine reached about 450 million dollars this year.
The total aid from Russia's combined Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula has risen to over $2.2 billion since then.
The U.S. Army is also engaged in training for the Ukrainian army.
Last month, in accordance with Ukraine's joint training program for multi-national support, we sent a Florida National Guard.
The U.S. Defense Department stated that European Special Operations Forces also play a major role in training and counseling the Ukraine Special Forces.
The number of U.S. Special Forces active in Ukraine has not been classified as classified in action.
President Baden had an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the seventh of this month, but he also had a tense exchange in the Ukraine situation.
The U.S. is also showing ready for severe economic sanctions when an invasion occurs.

Reconception of the inheritance tax, which makes pre-depreciation donations "forbidden" is a direct blow to the chairman of the Pre-demarital Taxation Council!
The first feature of the weekly diamond, December 18th, is the family talk at the beginning of the year!
It's a gift-in-the-life gift-in-law gift-in-law.
In the course of the debate between the union of inheritance tax and gift tax, the concerned 2022-year-old tax reformer was seen to be viewed as "forbidden" but in the near future, a pre-life gift, which is the royal road to inheritance tax control, is likely to be "forbidden."
How does the rules of inheritance change?
Along with a direct attack on Congressmen's pre-demand tax manager and the senators, we will give them a full amount of instruction from the basics of the gift and inheritance technique, which will be in place within the year.
(Diary Editor's Medals)
● "Forbidden " the" forbidden to use from property to city employees " proceed with a full - scale discussion of the creation of a neutral tax selection in the selection of property transfers, from a view of the inheritance tax and the taxing of the inheritance tax. " - The New York Times.
The ruling party announced last year's 2021-year-old tax corrections, and even the wealthy and the middle class were very upset.
Because what I mean is to change the rules of inheritance and make the pre-life gift of the inheritance tax a "forbidden" by making it "forbidden."
The rule of tax-resistant inheritance taxes is to "cut down the property that is subject to taxes."
The best gift for sale has been used extensively by employees who, of course, have a small share of the inheritance tax because of their home in three large urban areas.
The "Contactation of Inheritance Taxes and Gift Taxes" argument that came down in that way.
" The non-complimentary tax action, within a limit, is a system that requires no tax on the transfer of property in the family, " and a policy that has been reassessed to a qualitative point, such as the 22-year-old tax reformation of the issue of December 10th, which was concerned about the fastest intruding.
To interview the editorial staff, the chairman of the former tax survey of the private party and the former executive director of the pre-tax survey,
"It is the most important thing to lose the advantages and disadvantages of the transition of property, and to equal the tax burden whenever you go."
We're now running a simulation of what's going to come up with the problem of cohesion." If it's the fastest correction, we have three chances of a last-minute donation.
Even if it isn't, it's certain that in the near future, it will be very likely that you'll be far-off in the near future in order to nullify a living gift as a tax counter.
That's what we're talking about.

The team that won three match passes, the players, what did they feel? &lt;i&gt;Good News!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt;The team that won three games.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt;What did they feel? &lt;i&gt;
The path to this game, which Jones threw, is only three times.
This was in NFL in the last 50 years that Bills recorded two passes against the New York Gits in the third week of 1974.
In 1974 Bills had the extraordinary RB genius O.J. Mason, who crossed 2000 yards for the first time in the last season.
Bills was overwhelmed by a run by him and another RB Jim Braxton.
This time, the weather was the main reason that Paytriots expanded such an extreme fence.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and its latitude is no different than that of Hokkaido.
And on this day, the temperature was almost 1 ° or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, and the wind was blowing at 18 meters per hour, and before the match, it was snowstorming.
Bills was only local and didn't make a lot of changes in playing.
In contrast to 30 passes, the run is 25 times.
Allen's path is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no intercept, never a failure.
There were four red zone invasions in the ten fence series and a score plane.
Especially since the end of the 3Q, I went three times in a row to the Red Zone.
Only three times I could take away three points at FG1.
The finish line of the game's goal defense.
The building that followed the four points became 3rd &lt;14 by committing a penalty at 3rd & 9 and a 3rd &14.
It's 18 yards to the finish line.
At 3rd &14 QB Allen was surrounded by the rain of the Putrioriotsdi fence and ran out of his pocket to the right.
And he threw a pass at Tedson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
At this play, aceWR Steepens, who were outside the right, was free in front of the end zone, but it seems that Allen didn't see him.
4th and 18th, Allen aimed at WR Gavriel Davis, who ran from the left into the end zone.
Briant covered the WR call Beasley in Bills, but he saw Allen's movement and released Beasley and responded to the path.
Allen, who missed the two lesiers, threw a path in the end zone twice.
The 4th-down path may have been a dead end, but the 3r-down didn't have to aim at the TD.
You just have to take the first floor off with two plays.
Since it was still in front of two minitets, if I had made it short fourths and shorts, I would have lived up to Allen's ability to have a run of his own.
A combination of hair.

Spong
No matter how often I change it, it's probably not the sponge that I change as often as I am recommended.
From a study in 2017, we know that kitchen sponges reproduce a lot of bacteria, even if they kill in microwaves every day.
The German researcher who studied this study recommends that you change the sponge once a week to keep clean.
Cut board.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture points out that if you start to wear out and you have a wound or a ditch, you should change the board.
Once wounds and grooves are advanced, it becomes difficult to keep clean, and bacteria reproduce.
If you're still okay, don't forget to remove a gallon of water regularly with a single spoon of dehydrated liquid bleach.

Is the job and the form of employment a different story?
Rather, I don't understand why you think it's the same story.
Even simple labor can be a legitimate employee, and even intellectual labor can be a non-normal.
I need you to help me not finish FlashBIOS.
I bought Ryzen 7 5800X and replaced it with a phone that I bought in September with B550.
Once we went to the BIOS configuration screen, we saved the settings, and when it was restarted, we were in a state where the white cursor was not blinked on the black screen.
It doesn't stop me from trying to rewrite with FlashBIOS because I thought the CBIOS had been damaged.
MSI blogs say it'll be over in about five minutes, but it won't even be over in an hour.
That's what I'm trying to figure out. That's what I'm using to convert a SD card to someone who's too old to have a flash drive.

I don't think you ever dream of being uncomfortable with a fair probability.
I've been living abroad all my life, but the Japanese who went out there, including me, have never mistaken me for someone who came there who didn't want to go up and down, and who didn't want to go up and down, and who didn't want to say anything or didn't want to say anything to the natives.
If you look like a Westerner, you don't really feel bad about it. I think you do it with some kind of sweet or casual feeling.
Even my friends, if they're from Europe or America, have a few moments of doubt which way they're going to go when they speak Japanese.
Well, if it's a friend, it's fine.
It's probably pure normal at first, but you should say it now because if you're watching, you may lose your teeth in the unusual treatment of mascara.

I don't care, but when my white friends make a toast at a drinking party, they always raise their glasses higher than others, don't they?

In games produced overseas, this level of translation is seen well, and if it's a small company, I feel it's better translated.
I think it's important for non- Japanese native people to understand the difference between Japanese and Japanese, even after studying for a long time, to be able to reach it.

It's the battle that takes into account the "End of the Demons" training.
(Music) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends) (Music ends)
Of all recent boy cartoons, "the blade of demons" is especially different because "more training" is "more practice."
It is established that, on the whole, there is no battle, and the discipline to train at dawn or dawn is not popular among readers.
Let's be reminded by the fact that while there was a couple of years of training when the straw band broke apart in the same jump cartoon "NE PIECE," the rest of it floated wildly with just touching.
Well, Ampi's extraricity on the land he walks around is one of the most attractive things, and "Keeping in the Same Place" sometimes doesn't match well.
Now you can say that the discipline of the leader of the "Dungern's Sword" was begun by his bold stand for his life, and when he begged for the life of his son, who tried to kill him, he was told: "Don't let others take the power to kill him! "
The weak have no rights, no choice, and they're all driven down by the strong with force.
(In so doing, it was also the illustrator who didn't explain his intentions to me.)
"What are you going to do when your sister eats someone?"
Even among fans, it's an absurd exchange of stories and stories.
But it's a possibility that the moment comes when you're faced with such a decision when you're taking your demon sister with you.
From your attitude, you could say that you're going into the training process.
But I'm not yet in training yet, so I'm taking a amateur miner to the narrow mountain and asking him to come down to the bottom of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is thin and full of holes and slings and traps, and I'm going to die before I start my training.
Even so, it's barely "the hero's correction" to detect the faint smell of a trap that has been handled by human hands with a keen sense of its hold.
Even so, it's not going to happen so suddenly that you can avoid it all of a sudden.
A normal person doesn't suddenly become strong without warning, and waking up only makes it possible to use the "power and skill" that had been polished up to that point in its original context.
"The exchange of effort" does not pay back to the person who made the effort, nor does it reward any effort. It's a human praise, a rule that is not based on supernatural powers. It is a rule that is consistent with the work of the book.

The Samsong electron integrated the CE and IM sector into a set sector, then decided its name was DXE DeVice eXperientence, and announced it on the 12th of the year's end in tissue remodeling.

I've got 24 collisions, not a trailer driver.
It was found that the driver in the trailer that was arrested and sent away had no disease and that he had caused an accident due to some carelessness.
On the 10th morning, 24 trucks, motor vehicles, and so forth, hit the country road 41 in the port city, and 12 people were light-headed.
The police arrested Nomura's suspect who was driving the trailer for the first crash and for hurting a 71-year-old man.
The Nomura suspect's trailer continued without brakes after the accident, and the fire was making sure that he was unconscious for a while after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura's suspect has no disease and has been found to be caused by some kind of carelessness.
The police are searching their homes and researching the situation at the time.

The 20th Super-human Olympics, starting with the 3nd volume, are complete with these four!
In contrast with the foreword that drew all the way from the opening to the finals, there will be plenty of new moves!
● A metahuman prosthesis starts in front of a match!
These four volumes, in a few words, are a very polite drawing of Kinman versus Robin Mask finals. But first of all, what I want to keep in mind is that they're not the only ones that depict a ring game.
Starting with the signing ceremony, we're not going to go to the match with each other's prosthesis games and disciplines, but it's never boring.
This feeling of tension starting a century's war is gradually rising, and I cannot help but marvel at the fact that the performance of this period is definitely connected to the rise of the reader's tone and that even this period has been calculated.
And one more thing I can't miss before the important finals is the third decision match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Despite the luxury of playing cards, what I like about it is that, before the match, ramenman, on the backstage, said to Kinman's poster, "You're going to be my turn!"
And try to beat the chop.
But it happened that Terryman, who happened to pass by, took the knife and stopped it, was silent, and the scene was just breaking up.
What's great about this is that both of us are already out of the game, and we have no chance to fight Kinman at this convention anymore.
But there's such an easy-to-get way through that Kin meat man.
If I could show you this, I couldn't help but think of the far-off future.
This is what it's like to be a cartoonist.
The fight between the two ends so little, but the famous scene is the cry of ramenman's tears after the game.
"Don't fall for the strength of divine luck!"
That's what I'm talking about.
I think it's already been called a grand metaphor for the work itself, and so far, readers have felt like they've been winning in a way that's not really effective, since Kinman is a leading character in the end.
But by letting ramenman make this statement, the teacher has gone ahead and stabbed himself in the back of his hands that he can no longer use.
And he said, "Well, I don't know if that's true."
How?
You'll be able to imagine what you're going through, and if you look at it in another writerial light, it's as if the teacher tied himself up with his work, isn't it?
I thought this was an amazing thing.
I'm sure that's one of the big points in this scroll.

This morning, I'm having a bit of a bad day.
We've lost power to our NAS computer.
What happened.
1.) In the morning, open the window for ventilation.
This time I'm powered by a computer.
2.) After a while, when I get back to the room, I notice that the computer sounds like a pink roaster and shut down at once.
At this point I thought that the fans were only being affected by room temperature.
So after we heated the room, we decided to try again.
3.) Unactivated.
The power light will hold only for a moment when you press the button and the fans will stop immediately.
I won't say anything after that.
I pull the plug and try again, but it still only works for a moment.
4.) Connect the mother board to an ATX20 pin or four pins, remove the other parts and not start.
5.) I'm afraid that PSU may have been the cause of the bugbubbubbubbubble.
I'll try to find the extra ATX power.
Maybe.
