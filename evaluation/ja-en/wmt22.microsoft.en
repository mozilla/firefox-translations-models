When I tried to buy the entry package, I came out with a blue and orange package.
The price is more than double that of the orange one.
What's the difference?
I didn't understand it when I looked it up, so please let me know.
Right now, there should only be blue.
If there is, it may just be the old product remaining.
They are both the same, only they look different.

That's why I don't feel like watching TV anymore ...
Does it mean that comedians have become impossible? Television is full of comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there are quite a few scenes where the staff laughs behind my back even when I'm saying something that isn't particularly funny.
It's clearly not funny, but it's creepy to say, "I'm a popular comedian, so I have to laugh at everything I'm saying."
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be spoiled, and it will be unpalatable in terms of work.
Like the black companies of the past, that industry is like a sports club, and it seems that some comedians have too big egos and have a bad attitude in general, otherwise they won't be able to eat.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians themselves who talk about the difficulties of their work, and they say "don't lick the comedians" every time.
I know that my income is pretty low until I can sell it, but I don't know if comedians are at the top of the list of jobs where work is bad.
It sounds like a justification for the glorification of one's own career and the fact that comedians have too high a position in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is pretty tough, but I feel like it's getting harder and harder to come into contact with the world of entertainers.
I'm sorry for complaining.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't take it out like a fart...

The product I ordered at the Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheaper wireless mouse, received a wired version of the mouse, and was told to return it if I wanted a refund
It's more of a mail-order trouble than a homebrew PC topic, but no matter how you think about it, I'm not convinced and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here.
It all started when I found MSI's wireless gaming mouse on sale for 3,280 yen at the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo Day sale that started the previous Friday
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so when I checked the page of the wired version considering the possibility of a price mistake, it was 5,071 yen (linked to Uotaku), so I ordered it thinking that it was not a mistake
The order email arrived normally, and the next day I received the shipping email
In these two emails and in the purchase history on My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written
Since there was no notification of a mistake or cancellation from the order to the shipment, I thought at this point that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive
This is where the problem started, and a few hours after shipping, I received an email saying that there was a mistake in registering the product
According to the email:
* The wireless version was sold at a special sale, but it was actually a wired version.
* Since we have already shipped a wired mouse,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return only the mouse for a refund
3. Use a wired mouse as it is
Choose your response
The product pages of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and it seems that the wireless version was replaced with the wired version without permission even though it was written in the purchase history, email, and delivery note
Isn't it terrible that you are sent something different from the product you bought without your consent, and if you want a refund, you should return it from here?
Even if you finally accept a refund, I want to fight back once, so please lend me your wisdom

The reason why we don't get along is because there are people with various personalities and unreasonable people, whether it's parents or siblings.

Twice isolated... Typhoon and heavy rain washed away the only bridge connecting to the district Residents tripled their food stockpiles <Yamatsuri Town > Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima TV) --Yahoo! News
Yoshiro Matsumoto of the Takachihara district of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "At first, I was like, 'Oh my God.'
I wondered if it would break down so easily or if it would be swept away." The Takachihara Bridge, the only road leading to the Takachihara area, was washed away by a typhoon in eastern Japan, leaving 30 people from 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off the water supply continued to use the JR bridge, which is not normally allowed to pass, to transport necessary supplies.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "Normally, you can come to the garden by car, but when you get out of the car over there, you have to walk across the iron bridge with your hand or on your back, so I felt grateful for the means of transportation and the car." The temporary bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, and it was again isolated for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I'd like to secure enough food for 2~3 days." Canned food, cup noodles, and other foods that can be used as emergency food are about three times as much as they were before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, but you never know when a disaster will strike you, so I felt once again that it would be better for everyone to stockpile a little." On the other hand, Yamatsuri Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" in which a bridge was swept away.
In order not to forget the lessons, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Chief of the Yamatsuri Town Education Division: "We have decided to set it in the form of 'Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and have announced that October 12 will be a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards.
I think we're more aware of the possibility of the unexpected than ever before."

The test itself is almost over, so all that's left is to write a sentence, but for the time being, we are also doing a follow-up test to see if the measurement is correct, so please wait a little.

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) --Yahoo! News
● Newly established "Building Condition Survey" system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Second-hand housing transactions are booming.
Prices of both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is expanding.
While the trend toward home ownership has increased due to the Corona disaster, the popularity of properties represented by words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station," "large-scale," and "tower" is concentrated, and the number of relatively cheap newly built properties has decreased sharply.
【View image of this article】 However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and started a survey called inspection, which is a survey of building conditions for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of second-hand housing (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is familiar with housing checks the current condition of the property, including the deterioration of the property, and the condition of the building, compiles it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because the seller can avoid claims after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale transaction, and the buyer can feel safe.
In turn, it will lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, he explains that it is a system that allows buyers to grasp the condition of the second-hand house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and at first glance it is a system that has great merits.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the initiative to investigate the condition of the building.
In addition, it should be noted that only the announcement of the inspection system has become obligatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of the brokerage is obliged to explain, "I can introduce an architect who will investigate the building condition when brokering a property" or "I can't," but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
● Risks to be concerned about in seller-led inspections On the other hand, if we turn our attention overseas, similar systems are already in place in the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming.
In the pre-sale stage, the buyer asks an expert called an "inspector" or "building surveyor" to inspect the building.
For example, in the United States, inspections are carried out on 70~90% of second-hand housing transactions, depending on the state.
In that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting the inspection, the nature of the inspection is very different from that of the Japan type inspection of the "seller" main.
The seller tries to show the condition of the building as well as possible and sell it as high as possible and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the investigation and make appropriate repairs to live in peace of mind.
Even if the inspection is the same, there is a gap between the objectives and thoughts of both sides.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japan system.
● The scope of the investigation of the seller-led inspection set by the government is minimal.
Since it is not an in-depth investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For an inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "reckless" inspections may be conducted, such as not reporting the results of investigations that are unfavorable to the seller

5 trivia that you can talk about while brating silver (LEON.JP ) --Yahoo! News
"This used to be a peninsula.
As evidence...... It's also unique to Ginza to be able to show off a little trivia.
Here are some Ginza trivia facts that are interesting to know and will surely make you want to tell someone.
Go above Ginza ! ?
First infiltration of Kinza
As you walk through Ginza, you will see quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines, all of which are traces of the history that the land of Ginza has carved out.
I was walking with her in Ginza, and I was suddenly struck by silence and said, "This used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
Synonymous with the downtown area that gave birth to "○○ Ginza" in various parts of Japan, "Ginza" in Chuo Ward, Tokyo.
In the first place, "Ginza" is a mint for silver coins, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza Government Office, which was located in the current Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Currency Exchange Town", but when it was moved to Kagakucho, it came to be called "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that in the past, the area around Ginza was a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edomaejima" stretched from Japan Bridge to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula is now Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu established the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the bay and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the city block and built a moat to develop boat transportation.
They then cut down the soil that had been scraped from the moat and Mt. Kanda to reclaim the cove.
In addition, there is a stone monument of "Ginza Birthplace" in front of the Tiffany & Co. Ginza main store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), which indicates the site of the Ginza government office, so if you are interested, why not look for it?
Ginza's "Pilgrimage to the Holy Land"
In Ginza, there is an annual "pilgrimage to the sacred place" called "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour".
Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the most recognizable is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za theater.
At the shrine that stands at the far right of the Kabuki-za, there are many people who visit before and after the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Career Jizoson" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located at the back of the alley and are difficult to see, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known to have been revered by Kabuki actor Ichimura Hazaemon, and the "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance on the 1st floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places dedicated to Fudo Myō and Jizo Bodhisattva, but most of the shrines have Inari as a deity.
The "Inari Shrine", where a fox greets you in front of the shrine, was built in a place where there are many farmers, as it has the benefit of "five grains of abundance" where rice is often fertile.
In turn, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said that there were benefits for prosperous business, and the belief spread even in Ginza, the busiest downtown area in Japan.
What do you think of people who have returned home without being vaccinated?

Korea POSCO International acquires Senex Energy of Australia, expands overseas gas field business = Korean press (WoW! Korea ) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on March 12 that it has signed an agreement to acquire shares in Australia's Senex Energy and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, there are still procedures such as approval at the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy and approval of the local subsidiary, and the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
The acquisition marks the largest global merger and acquisition (M&A) case since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International has decided to invest 50.1% and Hankook Energy 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided to make this acquisition because it expects the demand for natural gas to continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and the hydrogen market will also be divided by blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, along with green hydrogen.
With the acquisition, POSCO International will also secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as onshore gas field operators in Australia.

That knee pain, maybe "knee osteoarthritis"! ?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) --Yahoo! News
Editor: Recently, I have been experiencing ongoing knee pain.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common in Japan is "osteoarthritis".
Editor: Does it mean that the joints will be deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for cushioning the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and strenuous sports, cartilage can wear out or become distorted.
As a result, it leads to deformity and inflammation of the joints.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis develop in addition to the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the knuckles and groins of the fingers, neck, hips, big toes, and hip joints.
However, the most common case occurs in the knee, which is called "knee osteoarthritis".
Editor: What kind of structure is a joint in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: The joint consists of two bones that are unevenly combined.
And the part where these two are facing each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the area around the joint is wrapped in "joint capsule".
Editor: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
In the inner layer of the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane, which makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing the movement of the knee.
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is tenacious and elastic, and plays a role in preventing direct collision between bones.
It's like a cushion, so to speak.
However, if it is worn or distorted, it can deform and inflame the joint, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you go to bed?
It's basically pajamas, but when the pajamas are being washed, I come to the jersey and sleep!
Even if you are a heavy smoker, can some people quit smoking, and some people can't?
Well, there are two types.
My acquaintance was heavy, but I stopped doing it altogether.
It seems that he decided to quit somehow, and he stopped as it was.

3 gambling & games of the "Kaiji" series that you can actually experience (real sound) --Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasts explosive popularity, especially among men.
One of the best parts of this game is the extreme game where you put your life on the line.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes my legs shrink ... ... Challenge the steel frame crossing!
So this time, I would like to examine Kaiji's games that can actually be played or practiced in the planning video.
■ Numa This is the trap-filled pachinko "Swamp" that appeared in "Gambling Breaking Record Kaiji".
In the original story, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This "swamp" was set up with large traps such as "Nail Forest", "Movable Role", and "Three-Stage Kroon", and it was almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of tricks, and in the end, he went to the rough business of placing a plastic water tank on the building and sinking and tilting the ground, and he successfully conquered it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and is played by many people.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball" and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you will be able to enjoy the feeling of Kaiji.
■ Steel Crossing At the "Star Side Party" held by the rich as a sideshow, the debtors, including Kaiji, were forced to carry out the "Human Horse Race" steel frame crossing.
Debtors compete to see how fast they can move on a thin steel frame 10 meters above the ground, trying not to fall.
There are 12 participants, and the top two will win a cash prize, but there are only four steel frames, and the safety measures are inadequate, and the chance of dying is quite high.
This steel crossing is highly dangerous, but it was developed as a VR game, and you can experience it very close to the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, the home of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles professional baseball team.
This Eagle Bridge is 20 meters high (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building) and has a single steel-framed bridge, and at the end of it, there is a "Sky Swing" and a "Victory Bridge", which you can walk to.
Of course, safety measures have been taken.
Comedian Koala Koarashi released a video of walking on the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube channel, saying that "you can experience steel crossing in Japan," and it became a hot topic.
■ E-Card is a two-player card game, "E-Card".
A total of 10 cards are used, one emperor card, eight citizen cards, and one slave card, and the emperor side and the slave side are divided.
The game is very well done, with the characteristics of the Emperor being strong against the citizens, the citizens being strong against the slaves, and the slaves being strong against the Emperor.
Kaiji confronts Tonegawa in the play with a strict rule that "if you lose, you will have your ears cut off".
In the end, Kaiji realized that a device that destroys his ears, such as earphones attached to his ears, was reading his mind by sensing and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, and he confused Tonegawa by cutting his own ears to the limit and making his body an abnormal value, and he won.
E-cards are available commercially and can be purchased on Amazon and other sites.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him competing with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, with an E-card, which attracted a lot of attention.
■ Can you try to feel like Kaiji?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's also true that reading manga only makes you feel good.
Why don't you feel the world view through the game?
A step towards the new year, gently boosted Tiger's Great Ema at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine|Yamagata Shimbun
At the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema of next year's zodiac sign "Tora" has appeared.
Students from the Tohoku University of Art and Technology, who designed it, visited the shrine on the 11th, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has commissioned students from the University of Arts and Technology to draw original drawings of ema.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was selected from among the nine students of the Japan Painting Course of the Department of Fine Arts, which is taught by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high in the center.
Mr. Tsuchiya said that he drew it with the image of "the cherry blossoms gently pushing your back as you step into the new year."
The image of the tiger stopping and looking at the cherry blossoms expresses the hope that "even in a rapidly changing world, we will have time to enjoy the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on the ema that is distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano who wants to continue to live" Proposal 4 high school students workshop in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital |
What will Tamano be like in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano where they want to continue to live."
As part of the survey and policy advocacy project of the Tamano SDGs Future Development Center, an intermediate support organization, we will compile the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayors.
"When do you have fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, students answer questions such as "when I'm having a blast with a lot of people" or "when I'm beating the drums."
The first event was held on November 13 at the Sunrise Fureai Hall.
Using the "World Café" method, in which 18 high school students and local people talk while moving around an "island" with a specific theme, they thought about "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns that make life worthwhile."
Write down your thoughts on sticky notes and paste them on imitation paper to organize them.
"A town with a lot of young people looks interesting" "Transportation such as trains and buses is indispensable for livability."
We will discuss further to see if there are any commonalities.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the beach is fascinating," said Tamano Shoko High School third-year student (18).
An 18-year-old third-year student at Binan High School said, "There are not many shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it's good to be in a place rich in nature," and by talking with adults, she seemed to notice not only the issues of the area but also the charms of the area.
In the second meeting in December, high school students gathered only to organize the content of the proposals.
The announcement is scheduled to be made in February next year, inviting the mayor and superintendent of education.
Rie Higashi, president of the center, said, "We hope that it will foster a love of hometown among high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to be actively involved in community development."

How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
It is an indispensable stole in winter, but do you sometimes feel the fabric flutter around your neck?
It's a good idea to look in the mirror after winding and adjust your balance, but I sometimes hear people say that they don't know the trick.
If you have a stole that doesn't stick and can be rolled up quickly... When I thought about it, I found something novel.
The stole of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which is more compact than the general one.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Can it be rolled up so short?"
If you look closely, you can see that the cloth is woven into a single piece, and the whole is mesh-like.
The mesh allows the end of the stall to pass through.
So you don't have to tie the ends together, you can roll them up and fasten them.
It is made of fleece material and is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular even for outerwear, but many people wear them in combination with stoles so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I am sure that it will come in handy to have such a stall.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
It's called Get Buck, and it's directed by Peter Jackson.
It's raw, it's like a life-size Beatles, and it's fresh in many ways......
It's just before the breakup, so I'm giggling, but it's not the dramatic gisgiss I imagined.
Paul is troublesome like "I know I'm annoying, but come on!" while doing his best, George, who seems to be squirming and says, "But-", and John, who is late and unmotivated even though he calmly says his opinions and jokes...... Ringo, who plays the role of soothing, doesn't actively interject, and sits in the back with a face that says, "I'm in trouble."
We don't hate each other enough to fight like that, but there's a certain feeling in the atmosphere of "well, it's impossible to work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance starts, everyone is really talented
From a small phrase, the process of finishing up with "that masterpiece" while each other is doing "How about this?" is dangerous
In particular, the moment when the title "Get Buck" is completed is amazing
It's amazing that the scene where the casual humming like a hun-hun-hoon gradually turns into that mess ♪ ♪ and the lyrics are well recorded.
It's amazing because it's not often that you get to see the process of composing like this
Also, it's natural, but everyone is getting fat, so just watching the performance scene makes me happy.
It seems to be only one of three episodes, but so far I had the impression that the biggest cause of the breakup was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves
The four of them are complaining about something, but when they start writing songs, they seem to have fun, but what about the place of the show? When it came to talking about it, it was easy to understand that producers and publicists were saying things like, "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!" and that they had already left their hands
Well, documentaries also have the director's interpretation, so maybe Peter Jackson felt that way......
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising it, so I thought that might be the reason why Paul has a lot of scenes that are rather villainous.

Tornadoes often occur in the United States and cause major damage Unseasonably warm and strong cold air (Weather News) --Yahoo! News
From the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, there were many tornadoes mainly in the southern part of the United States.
It was the warmest on record for this period, but the strong cold air moved southward, which made the atmospheric conditions very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday 9th and Friday 10th local time has risen to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
In the midst of such record-breaking warmth, a strong cold air of -30°C or lower moved southward at an altitude of 5500 m, so an active front was formed due to a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
It seems that tornadoes have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The southern United States is originally prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage during this period.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day during the winter months, a record number.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts of wind on Friday the 10th (local time) alone.
According to this, it can be seen that there are two main concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (Improved Fujita Scale), which indicates the strength of the tornado, reached EF3, which is the third from the strongest of the six levels, and it is believed that gusts of wind around 70 m/s blew instantaneously.
Depending on future investigations, it may be judged to be EF4~5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japan version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used based on the Modified Fujita Scale to match the situation of buildings in Japan.
JEF3, which is equivalent to a tornado in the United States this time, has a good chance of occurring in Japan, and it is at a level where wooden houses collapse.

US tornado 'the largest ever' There are also voices calling for help from under the rubble in live broadcasting (Daily Sports) --Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and Southern United States, US President Joe Biden said on the 11th (12th Japan time) that it was "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States."
CNN TV and others reported.
Biden stressed that "as a federal government, we will do everything."
"We don't yet know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he said.
The death toll is feared to exceed 100.
Pictured: Residents carry belongings from damaged houses in Kentucky, which was hit by a tornado From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
There is a record of 219 miles (about 350 km) of damage caused by the tornado in 1925 in Missouri and other states, but CNN meteorologists estimated that this time it was the largest at about 250 miles (about 400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was severely damaged, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
At that time, 110 people were employed, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace of it.
A woman who was stuck under the rubble, which was about 1.5 meters thick in the dark, felt the weight of rescuers searching on the rubble and called for help via a Facebook live broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the woman's screams for help, the live broadcast also included screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which another woman apparently sang while crying to dispel fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, was safe after hiding in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"A lot of people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying sound, like something gushing out of the earth," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police officer said: "The search operation will continue until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know if it's going to be weeks, months, or years."
In Illinois, at least six people have been confirmed dead after a warehouse at the e-commerce giant Amazon partially collapsed.
The train derailed due to the impact of the car being separated, and the expressway has been blocked one after another due to the impact of overturning of the vehicle.
According to U.S. web media, a total of about 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, are without power.

There is a "live-in job" in the related search, so it seems that there are many colleagues like that.

There is an old discourse that there are different ways of thinking about the star-based rating system.
While other countries deduct points based on five stars, Japan insists on adding or subtracting points from three stars as neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of 2 stars, and 4 stars has a completely different meaning between "there is a deduction element" and "it is not a masterpiece but it is an honorable mention".
If you use 5 stars as the standard, "works that have no flaws" and "works of the highest standard in all respects" will be in the same line, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of stars, but since such a system is actually operated in such a way, you say that you should not give it 3 stars (bad reputation).
So if you try to refute those who argue this kind of discourse with Steam's two-choice rating, the story will not mesh.

I made an AM radio with my own condenser and coil, but it was so noisy that I couldn't hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but I heard a different frequency than the one I tuned.
It's possible that the tuning was too sweet and I didn't hear it properly, but it wasn't what I expected.

Bento box "Seasonal fried fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
"hakobune" is a take-out specialty store of colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) that use plenty of vegetables.
"So that you can feel like a restaurant at home," Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year.
One of the most popular bento menus is "Seasonal fried fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best ones at the market.
"The fried shrimp are made as thin as possible so that you can see the texture of the ingredients," says Takayuki, and the plump texture of fried shrimp can be directly seen.
The lunch box comes with about 4 kinds of vegetables and deli as a garnish, rice with millet and soup with rice from Saga Prefecture Hinohikari.
Vegetables are purchased home-grown in the soba field or at direct sales shops in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the time of year, but Takayuki has trained in French, and lapé and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, it has a "familiar and comforting taste" like a dashi egg roll (Yumi), and it is a mix of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
The bento box "Handmade hamburger steak with domestic meat" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the company will also release a "Charcuterie Set," a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

There was something that looked interesting at Haneda Airport, which I happened to stop by, so I tried using it
Ride quality: It's not that bad, but it shakes occasionally (not so much that you get drunk)
Speed: Naturally slow
Safety When there were people around, I slowed down, and in some cases I stopped completely, so I think it's safe for the time being, but I thought it was dangerous in some places
The gaze around me hurts, it's good to be seen, but it's like "I'm in the way" and it's heartbreaking.
Verdict: It's not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it would be easier to use if there were a few fewer people or if there were more considerations such as getting closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create a dedicated lane so that it would not interfere with other people walking
However, it is also relaxed, and I thought it would be a good ride if there were a few fewer people because you can relax while looking at the scenery
It was a difficult vehicle unless you had a very patient heart, with the excitement of the near future feeling that this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the gaze of the surroundings
I was so embarrassed

If you look very closely, you may be able to see a little, but it is an ese una bowl that does not use eel at all.
In fact, "! Eggplant!" It is! (Tap to get the correct answer.)
I like eel, but in fact, everyone eats it with sauce, and I thought that the eel part could be anything other than actually done... I thought that the texture and quantity of the eel were quite important.
I didn't want eels to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat them.

One man was slashed and escaped on a man's motorcycle On the 12th, an attempted murder case in Daizai, Saga City|Incidents and accidents|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a knife by a man believed to be in his 30s ~ 40s on the street of Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, and suffered injuries to his face.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and the Saga South Police Department is investigating his whereabouts as an attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Department, a passerby called 110 to report that he was fighting.
The man suffered injuries to his left cheek about 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter deep, but he is said to be conscious.
The man who escaped is a skinhead with medium meat.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
The man said he had been drinking with several acquaintances, and they are investigating whether there was some kind of traffic trouble between the pedestrian man and the motorcycle man.

The long road of a family that rooted environmental protection activities in China's frontier (JBpress) --Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Corporate Consultant, Find Asia, a Hong Kong company) With its vast land area, China is also important in terms of biodiversity, and has the world's largest number of mammals and the third largest number of plant species.
Some municipalities recognize the value of biodiversity and promote the activities of environmental activists as well as the environmental protection carried out by the municipality.
Xisapanna, Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is one such region.
Her younger sister, Li Wan-hyeon, is currently active as an actress Sisapanna is a region bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Tai" people, who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flow.
Xisapanna Tai Autonomous Prefecture Although the area of Xisapanna is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, it is home to about 25% of wild animals and 20% of plants.
This time, we met Mr. Li Wang-gu, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and talked about the contents of his activities.
■ Started environmental protection activities with her German husband ― ― I heard that you have been involved in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What was the impetus for this?
Ms. Lee: Our environmental protection activity "Tianxiang" started in 2000.
It all started with my husband, Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
This was the only rainforest area in China and boasted one of the most biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
As a result, large-scale logging of the rainforest has progressed in the past in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
The husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
He met me as a reporter here and got married.
― ― Didn't you have an interest in nature conservation before that?
Ms. Lee: I'm from Sisapanna, but I didn't have any interest in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who don't have a well-formed face or are particularly tall, but have an aura, why do you think that is?

Aura is not something that comes out with the intention of emitting it.

That person must have a lot of confidence inside.

I think about it, but is it detailed to say that the other person's clothes are good or that the color is good?
It's not detailed, is it?
I can see it.
I don't think it's detailed.
I've never been told that it's a compliment, so I don't know what it means.
I guess I praised them in detail.
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
"Sakura-san confessed, my heart is in full bloom of spring, please do this," and we will go together.
And in order to get along, we want to increase our knowledge of golf and share what we like with each other.

【Oma Ring / Personal Reminder】 The cause of CTD in the mod's own environment, and it took about one and a half months to identify.
While I didn't have much time to play around GW with stable data until March, CTD due to multiple factors was occurring, and it took me a long time to identify it as I felt like I was investigating it little by little, mainly on holidays.
Why. Didn't you parse the logs with Net Script Framework (and you'll find out in a few minutes)?Some errors in the .dll series and mesh relationships don't make it to the crash log.
〇 Timing of main CTDs
* All papyrus or. Net Script Framework, a log-type .dll plug-ins that leaves no footprints in the logs.
* When some NPCs are killed/attacks accumulated: Activated by console kill →Improved by turning off Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / powerofthree's SE update resume version) * Is there a possibility that this is a bad idea?
* Basic improvement by turning off the kill move setting by PC via .ini when the camerawork activates the kill move for some NPCs→ Conflict with DAR+Nemesis? However, the number of DAR anime has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit
* (Basic outdoor) While moving in the field + some magic (e.g., freezing runes) is activated, when NPC hits: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (upper right corner of MCM) All are turned off and all improved in 5 consecutive attempts.
Is it due to a missetting of shaders for additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or body meshes? Note that the default .ini using SPID in 2.0 has a mistake in the format, but the result is the intended result, and the premise perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking the part attacks and OnHit-related motion/combat mods (.dll ones), but the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there is anyone who has a similar CTD problem in the Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful as a reminder.
Everyone is doing it with a barely ready mentality.
People around you don't even notice it, let alone your colleagues, let alone your family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that he is doing a good job even though he seems to be having a hard time.
But perhaps he's also mentally on the edge.
I didn't retire in the name of mentality, but I think I was at my limit just before I retired.
Thoughts on the Importance of Psychiatric Home Nursing - After Today's Home Nursing
I have bipolar disorder, so I have been receiving home nursing for a long time, and I have a long relationship with the nurse (female) at the visiting nursing station that I am currently using, and I think I have a very good relationship with her.
We talk about a lot of things every week.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging medication), but above all, I was reminded of how important it is for people with mental illness to have fun communication.
Today, we had a chat about gender differences between men and women, or rather, we discussed gender theory.
Is it okay to talk about the sexual desire of a man and a woman, why she divorced, etc.? I also talk about things like that.
Sometimes, I'm dressed as a woman.
However, in the case of a home-visit nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, I have heard from acquaintances that an aunt nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and only responds to administrative matters, or that an occupational therapist comes to visit nursing and gives instructions from above, saying, "This is medical care."
I use a small home-visit nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think she is a really good nurse who treats me frankly as an equal with people with mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful lol.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home nursing, and some of you may be thinking about receiving one.
Home-visit nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves it, take it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I couldn't get the warp right, so I canceled the contract here.
Sorry for the pun.
I know it's a fake warning, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several possible causes, but for example...
・ I don't know what the person who made it will be displayed in Japanese
- Defects in language judgment
- Your browser is set to English first.
The rankings in order of the number of occurrences in the lottery of Lotto 6 are all odd numbers.
Why is it so hard to get odd numbers?
It's strange.
There is a pattern of appearance.
It can be repetitive, or it can go on and on.
I became teleworking due to the Corona disaster.
But at home, I can't concentrate on my work.
I get scared and immediately touch my phone.
Even if you drink coffee, you won't make much progress.
What kind of ideas do you have?
I'm doing it again without concentrating lol.
I feel like I'm just doing what I have to do.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one-fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementation of Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" ( JoongAng Ilbo Japanese version ) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a roadmap for the hydrogen economy.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be disseminated (cumulative) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, fuel cell vehicles accounted for only 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure is also 38% (about 117 locations) of the target, and the price of hydrogen per kilometer is in the 8,400 won range, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economy roadmap is well below the target value.
On the 12th, the Japan Business Federation (Zenkeiren) released a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Economic Ecosystems."
According to the report, most of the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States, Japan, and other countries.
Toray Industries (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, which is the core material for fuel cell vehicles, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.), and 3M (U.S.) supply membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average annual rate of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total from 2014 to 2020), Korea ranks fifth in the world.
However, the Zenkeiren reported that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that they are actually at the bottom of the competition."
The ranking of patents by country is in the order of China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the United States to become the number one country, and the gap has widened.
South Korea ranked fourth in the number of patents registered in 2020 with 1,033, surpassing Japan (974), but at 22% of the level of China (4,721).
The Zenkeiren proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax credit for capital investment and R&D expenses.

The town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as creating a wacky flyer to announce the holding of regular meetings and introducing a "report card" in which the townspeople evaluate the council members.
The town council election is held without a vote for three consecutive terms, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
In order to publicize the Sunday Assembly held on the 12th, about 1,800 leaflets of the new work were distributed in newspaper inserts on the 9th.
"Raw Giron from the Morning" "Tetsuko's Room" "Hitoshi Sawaguchi Exploration Series" ... .
The flyers distributed by the town council to all households on the 9th are reminiscent of the name of a popular TV show.

U.S., aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, also engaged in troop training (CNN.co.jp) --Yahoo! News
(CNN) -- U.S. State Department officials reported Tuesday that equipment including small arms and ammunition has arrived in Ukraine under a security aid plan approved by President Biden.
The total military aid is worth $60 million, and the last piece of equipment, including four radars that identify mortar and other launch sites, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
Pentagon spokesman Kirby said the aid included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The purpose of the military assistance is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the troop buildup that the Russian military is promoting around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. has become increasingly wary of Russian troop movements and is consulting with NATO members to plan a response if Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden approved weapons aid during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House on Sept. 1.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine has reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forcible annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, the total amount of aid has risen to more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for Ukrainian forces.
Last month, the U.S. National Guard deployed the Florida National Guard in support of a multilateral joint training program in support of Ukraine.
According to a statement from the Pentagon, U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe have also played a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, and there was a tense exchange on the situation in Ukraine.
The U.S. is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of the inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes gifts during life "forbidden", directly hit Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking with your family during the year-end and New Year holidays!
Pre-mortem gifts and last-minute inheritance techniques".
As discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, there is a great possibility that gifts made during lifetime, which is the royal road to inheritance tax measures, will become "prohibited," although it was postponed in the 2022 tax reform outline, which was a concern.
How will the rules of inheritance change?
In addition to a direct hit to the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and a member of the House of Representatives, Akira Amari, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifting and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for a last-minute gift that will be delivered in time for the end of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Hiroaki Miyahara)
● "Prohibiting" pre-mortem gifts to be used by wealthy people and urban office workers "From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale consideration toward the establishment of a tax system that is neutral to the choice of the timing of asset transfer."
The ruling party's announcement last year of the fiscal 2021 tax reform outline caused a great deal of upset not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
This is because what it means is to drastically change the rules of inheritance and to significantly increase the inheritance tax by making "gifts during lifetime," which is the royal road to inheritance tax measures, "prohibited."
The golden rule of tax saving measures for highly progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce taxable property".
Pre-mortem gifts, which are the strongest trump card, have been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by office workers who incur a small amount of inheritance tax due to having a home in the three major metropolitan areas.
In such a situation, the debate on "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" arose.
Although it was postponed in the FY22 tax reform outline announced on December 10, which was feared to be introduced at the earliest, "We will review the current inheritance settlement taxation system and the calendar-year gift system" and "We will constantly review the gift tax exemption because it is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limit." With more in-depth wording, the policy for unification was reaffirmed.
In an interview with this editor, Akira Amari, former secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax research committee and former chairman of the tax system, said:
"The most important thing is to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of property transfers, and to keep the tax burden the same at all times.
Right now, we're simulating what kind of problems will arise [with integration]." If the amendment is the fastest, there are only three chances left for the gift during lifetime.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future, there will be a major shift in the direction of invalidating pre-mortem gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly will the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

"My Right Brother" terrestrial broadcast from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa "Please look forward to it! "
The FOD original drama "My Right Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
Photo: Kasumi Yamatani as the heroine Based on the manga of the same name by Satoshi Morie, which has been serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018, this work is a sad pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the past.
The main character, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Riyo, is played by Kasumi Yamatani.
Riyo, a college student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly with the help of Riyo's shoulder for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother who was separated from her by her parents' divorce, but at some point, Kairi is a murderer.
・Yudai Furukawa Comment The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial television from January 10th!
I hope that those who have not been able to see it on FOD will be able to look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will be able to learn more about this work if they know the development and see the complex psychological depiction of Kairi and Riyo, as well as the two people who struggle and change.
I hope fans of the original will enjoy it.
Stay tuned!

[NFL] The team that won with 3 passes in 1 game What and how did the players feel (BBM Sports) --Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw passes = only 3 passes by the Patriots.
That's the fewest passes in the NFL in 50 years since the two passes the Bills recorded in Week 3 against the New York Jets in Week 3 1974.
The 1974 Bills had an unsung RB in O.J. Simpson who had surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with runs from Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, and in terms of latitude it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was almost 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at 18 meters per hour, and there was a blizzard before the match.
The Bills didn't change their play selection too much, because they were local.
He ran 25 times against 30 passes.
Allen's pass was 15/30 for 145 yards.
We didn't make any interceptions, and we weren't bad at all.
In the 10 offensive series, they had four red zone intrusions and scoring opportunities.
Especially since the end of the third quarter, they have advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three innings, they were able to score only three runs in one FG.
Defending in front of the goal in the final stages of the game.
Trailing by four points, the Bills committed penalties in 3rd&9 to move to 3rd&14th.
It was 18 yards to the goal.
In the 3rd & 14th innings, QB Allen stepped out of his pocket and drifted to his right, surrounded by the rush of the Patriots defense.
He threw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but missed.
On this play, ace WR Stephon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran a shallow-cross and got free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.
On the 4th and 18th, Allen tried to get WR Gabriel Davis to run in the end zone from the outside left, but his pass was missed by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in front of him.
Bryant was covering Bills WR Cole Beasley man-to-man, but he saw Allen move and let Beasley go and reacted to the pass.
Allen missed two receivers and threw passes in the end zone both times.
The pass on the fourth down may have been decisive, but on the third down, there was no need to go for the TD.
You just need to get a first down on two plays.
It was still two minutes ago, so if he had made it 4th and short, Allen's ability to run his own would have come into play.

It's time to "throw it away" & "it's time to replace", 3 items that tend to be left in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR (Harper's Bazaar) --Yahoo! News
sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably the sponge that you don't change as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can grow a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (but it's still a good idea to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researchers who did the study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
chopping board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture points out that if it starts to fray, scratches or grooves, it should be replaced.
This is because once the wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria grow.
If you're still okay with it, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a tablespoonful of unscented liquid bleach in 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and let it sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, let dry naturally, or dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or cracked tableware
Getting rid of your favorite mug can be heartbreaking, but the chipped surface becomes a new breeding ground for germs and germs.
In addition, the chipped part can cause the lip to be cut and the drink to be spilled.
That's right, here's your chance to buy a new mug you love!

Help FlashBIOS Won't End
I bought a Ryzen 7 5800X, so I replaced it with the B550 and Tomaho I bought in September.
I went to the BIOS setting screen once, but when I saved the settings and rebooted, a dot that looked like a white cursor on the black screen did not blink and was in a state where it was accepted all the time.
Even if I think that the BIOS is damaged and try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS, it does not end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it takes about 5 minutes, but it doesn't end in 1 hour
The possible cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and the one who converts and uses the SD card
- Is it too much sleep and Tomaho is being scolded?
Is there any other reason for this?

In Japan. Are.
It has nothing to do with gaijin-style.
I'd better say it sooner, "Why are you just calling me out?"
So it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner, right? If you start to think about it, you should simply say that it's uncomfortable.
I don't think I ever dreamed that I would be uncomfortable with a reasonable probability
I was living abroad along the way, but Japan people who went out, including me, didn't like the Confucian customs of the upper and lower ranks, and there were quite a few people who came, and I had the misconception that I could say anything to the locals.
If you look like a Westerner, I don't think you're doing it with any genuine offense, but with a kind of sweetness or a friendly feeling.
Even my friends who are Westerners call me by their first names, but sometimes when I speak in Japanese, I am a little confused about which one to use.
Well, if you're friends, it's still good.
I'm sure he's just doing it normally, but if you ignore it, you may not be able to stop the exceptional treatment because you're a gaijin, so it's better to say it now.

Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do it that way, you won't be strangely spoiled by younger or older people, or you will be treated like a Japan person.
Because Japan people (including me) who look at such details regardless of their personality

Thank you 50 subscribers!
When I opened reddit today, this sable I just made has exceeded 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to get to 50, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today alone, so I'm very grateful.
If you subscribed to this sable today, I would appreciate it if you could tell me in the comments section where you heard about this sable! (I'm really curious because I don't know)
I'm the only person who is currently making a thread, so I would be grateful if you could make a thread as well.
Even if you don't make a thread, it would be encouraging if you could make a comment.
Maybe they use Reddit, but few people use Twitter.
If you are using Twitter, please make a thread!
Last but not least, thank you very much! The sable I made before didn't attract as many people as I wanted, and I was quickly frustrated, but this time, thanks to everyone, I think I can continue without setbacks.
I will do my best to improve the wiki and rules so that the sable is easy to use, so I look forward to your continued support!

I only understand a little bit of English, so I will judge only by the translated text.
I think that the translated text is at a level where you can feel a little uncomfortable with the text, but you can understand what you want to convey and it doesn't interfere with the amount of play (I just feel this way, I think it's better to ask other people)
It's common to see this level of translation in games made overseas, and I feel that if it's a small company, it's a good translation.
I think that people who are not native Japanese can understand the differences in the fine nuances of Japanese even if they study for a long time whether they can reach it.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japan people do not feel uncomfortable, you should look for someone else.

Consideration: "Demon Slayer" training is a battle.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human anthem <anime commemorating the start of "Yugaku-hen" > (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) --Yahoo! News
Among recent shonen manga, "Demon Slayer" is particularly different in that it requires a lot of training.
It is a well-established theory that there are no battles in most cases, and that training at dawn and dusk is not very popular with readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that in the same Jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Gang were separated, they trained for two years, but they only drew the touch and swept away the rest with gusto.
Well, one of the charms of Wanpi is the eccentricity of the land to which she travels, and "staying in the same place and practicing" may not be so compatible.
By the way, the training of Tanjiro, the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", is when he sits down on the ground with Yoshiyuki Tomioka, who saved his life, and begs for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life, he says, "Don't let others take the right to kill or kill you! ! " It can be said that it started when I was told by a volunteer.
The weak have no rights or choices, they can only be defeated by the strong by force . . .
With that said, it was the kindness of Giyu (who is also a bad communicator who does not explain his intentions) who introduced Sakonji Scaletaki, the "nurturer" who trains those who want to join the Demon Slayer Corps.
The first contact between Tanjiro and Scales is when he is asked, "What do you do when your sister eats people?", and Tanjiro is stuck in an answer, saying that he is "slow to judge".
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange of stories among fans.
However, taking her sister who has become a demon with her has the potential to come a moment when she will be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that it is an initiation that enters the training from the mindset.
However, Tanjiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, is taken to Mt. Sagiri and told to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The air is thin and the mountains are full of pitfalls, trebuchets, and traps, and you are likely to die before you start training.
Even so, he uses his keen sense of smell to sniff out the faint scent of a trap set by human hands, and manages to avoid it.
Still, "That doesn't mean that you're suddenly physically capable enough to get around all of a sudden! This is the essence of what makes Demon Slayer a Demon Slayer.
Ordinary people don't suddenly become stronger without any backing, and the only thing that awakens them is to be able to use the "power and skills that they have honed up to that point" to their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort" that rewards those who put in the effort, and nothing rewards the effort they don't, is an anthem to humanity that is different from demons with unfounded supernatural powers, and it is an immovable rule that is consistent in this work.
Is this old?
Not yet, it is not a bed, but a mat directly at home, and a mattress and comforter are used to sleep.
The house is not a condominium.
That's what I do, too.
If you want to use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon than on a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Are you upset?
Are you working part-time and want to work full-time?
No, I don't think so.
In that case, it doesn't fall under what I think of as "stubbornness".
I think it's "annoying" to try to get more profit than effort with the least amount of effort.

Samsung Electronics of Korea establishes a new "DX Division" that integrates consumer electronics and mobile devices, and "emphasizes user experience" ( WoW! Korea ) - Yahoo! News
Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) following the integration of its CE and IM divisions as a set division, and that it will reflect this in its organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
It can be read that the purpose is to enhance the user experience through a variety of services from mobile to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics revealed that its DX division, which was newly launched by merging its CE and IM divisions, will consist of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Networks.
A Samsung Electronics official explained, "This name change reflects our medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of global leadership."
It also emphasized the company's intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy optimized experiences through products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and telecommunications equipment, as well as services and solutions that reflect customer needs.
With the inauguration of the integrated leadership structure, the name also reflects the strategy of creating synergies across organizational boundaries and building a foundation for differentiated products and services on a company-wide scale.
Samsung Electronics is already working on a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council to allow users to freely use content and services through the linkage between devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based home appliances and smartphones.

> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> tiger beetle larvae ambush in the sand in order to catch their prey at any time, showing only a disc-shaped head from the sand.
It's a bit unnatural here.
Tiger beetle larvae lie in wait in the sand so that they can capture their prey at any time, and only their disc-shaped heads peek out of the sand.
I think it should be.
I'm curious about
* Did you use other documentaries as a reference?
* Are you looking at it from an ant's point of view?
Is it?
If you translate armoured heads as disc-shaped heads, I think the part that says "on the scale of an ant, it's a giant beast wearing a helmet" disappears...
Aichi 24 cars collide Trailer driver has no chronic illness Is it careless (TV Asahi (ANN)) --Yahoo! News
In an accident in which 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent to the hospital had no chronic illness and was thought to have caused the accident due to some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Highway 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the hospital on the morning of the 12th.
The Nomura suspect's trailer continued to move forward without stepping on the brakes after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that the Nomura suspect temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to those involved in the investigation, the suspect Nomura did not have any chronic illnesses and it was believed that some kind of negligence was the cause.
Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident by raiding the victims.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] ( Weekly Pre-NEWS ) --Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympiad, which began with volume 3, is completed in these four volumes!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted the opening game to the semi-final match at once, it is full of new gimmicks because it focuses only on one match!
- [Kinnikuman] Volume 4 Review Author's Name: Oginuma X ★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) - Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are a meticulous and careful depiction of the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing to keep in mind is that this is not a volume that depicts only the matches in the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, we didn't get to go to the games very often, with the back-and-forth battles and special training scenes, but it wasn't boring at all.
This feeling in the work, in which the tension gradually increases as the match of the century finally begins, is definitely connected to the heightened tension of the reader, and I am amazed at how calculated the production is even during this period.
And before the all-important final, one more mountain that should not be missed is the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Aside from the glamour of the fight card, what I like is that before the match, Ramen Man goes backstage to the Kinnikuman poster and says, "Now it's my turn to go! 」
and tries to slam the chop.
However, a terryman who happens to be passing by catches the sword and stops it, stares at each other silently, and the scene is just that they part.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated, and there is no longer a chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a thing about Kinnikuman.
If you can see something like this, you can't help but think about the success of the distant future!
This is an act that makes me keenly aware of what it means for a character to stand up, even now as a manga artist!
The fight between the two doesn't take much time, but the famous scene is Ramen Man's tearful plea after the match.
"Don't rely on the strength of God's luck! ! 」
That's the line.
This is already a grandiose meta statement about the work itself, and I think that readers have had a faint feeling that Kinnikuman can't lose because he's the main character after all, and that he's somehow winning in areas where he's not really good.
However, by making Ramen Man make this statement, Mr. Boiled Egg has been ahead of himself and has nailed that he can't use his hands anymore.
With this one word, the reader asks, "Oh, so Kinnikuman will defeat Robin with his own strength?
How? 」
The uncertain development will stir your imagination again, and if you look at it from another writer's point of view, this is a line that is as if the boiled egg teacher who creates the work has imposed a restraint on himself.
I thought this was a great thing.
I think it's definitely one of the main points of this volume.

Winter illumination weekend held Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) ( FBC Fukui Broadcasting ) --Yahoo! News
At the Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illumination has begun, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
(Dec. 12) The winter illumination, which began on November 26, is studded with 50,000 LED bulbs along the walking paths and lawns, including a 20-meter-high camphor tree.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised that there was such a place.
It's so beautiful and it makes me feel relieved."
The illumination was planned for the first time to give people a sense of healing while avoiding crowds, and it will be lit from 5 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25.
In addition, on the last day, the 25th, as a Christmas event, there will be a button pot behavior and a movie screening.

Misfortune this morning...
My NAS PC won't turn on anymore 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
〜What happened~
1.) Open the windows in the morning for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is energized.
2.) When I returned to the room after a while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, I thought that the room temperature drop (6°C) was just making the fan run worse.
So I decided to try again after warming up the room.
3.) Without starting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp turns on for a moment, and the fan also moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I don't say yes or no.
I unplugged the power plug and tried again, but it still turned on only for a moment.
4.) Connect only the motherboard and ATX 20 pins and 4 pins, remove the other parts and try it, but it does not start.
5.) I've been hearing a buzzing noise as if the PSU fan is hitting something for some time, so I suspect the PSU is the culprit.
At a later date, I will find a surplus ATX power supply and try it.
Probably.
If it doesn't work... What should I do.
Do you change the case and the mother together?
Have you seen a rabbit in the wild recently (within the last 4-5 years)?

How do you dispose of computers and peripherals?
* PC Farm
I've only brought it in once, but even though it's in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, Saitama Prefecture doesn't collect it for free.
(If it is relatively new, there is free)
* Inverse Net
I've never used it, but it seems that Sagawa is completely free with cash on delivery.
I'm thinking of using it, so if anyone knows, I'd like to hear what they say.
* Oversized garbage (charged), postscript> Local government collection box (small appliances free of charge)
* Sell second-hand.
P.S. > Mercari, Hard-Off
I wonder if there are people who sell it at flea markets or auctions? I've never sold a used PC.
It may be a wise choice to sell it while it still makes money
* Postscript> Lynette Japan Information provided by: /u/CheetahPresent8059
Broken printers, old UPS, etc., which are not picked up by anyone, have become a hindrance.
It's not the size of bulky garbage, so it probably doesn't cost money, but it's been put off somehow.
I collect coins as a hobby
If you know how much this coin is worth, please let me know.
Coins circulating in foreign countries are not worth it...
Banknotes are exchanged in Japan, but coins are not exchanged
If it is a commemorative gold coin, it contains gold, so it is worth it
You don't like that guy even though he didn't do anything wrong, right?
Yes, it's natural to like and dislike because you're human.
"I don't like something (for no reason)", people who don't like it are like that.

She can't, but is she being discriminated against on her face?
It's not the face, it's the heart.
But it's sad that you can decide by your appearance.
Because you can't show your inner self.
What did you do with your school athletic clothes after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^

Hopefully, it will be easy to care for, evergreen, and hopefully fruitful.
Thank you in advance.

How much money do you need to save to live together?
Everyone is different.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It is better to stop living together.
There is a high probability of parting.
It is better to make a proper matchmaker, hold a marriage ceremony, go to this and that bridal, have a wedding, and a reception.
Cohabitation has no merit.
I think it's better to stop...
Today I went to the arcade and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Gunba Rising.
Oh! I thought it was a Legend Rare, but it was (^_^;) a reprint of Legend Rare
Is it possible to play a game that uses cards like Gamba Rising as a hobby?
I think it's an ant.
