All have been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
He urged people to be vaccinated against rabies with their pets and not to touch saliva in suspected animals.
Rabies infects people not only from dogs but also from cats and bats.
When a person is infected and develops, almost one hundred percent of the death is killed, but vaccination before the onset of the disease can prevent death.

FUJI To be left behind to prevent accidents System development Experiment with in-house vehicles|Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information of Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shizuoka
FUJI (headquarters in Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on a system to prevent children from being left behind in the car.
When a motion sensor is installed in the car and detects the movement of a person, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, we are conducting demonstration experiments with the transfer vehicle of our own facility.
In the midst of painful accidents caused by being left behind, we will protect the safety of children.
Currently, we are conducting demonstration experiments with two transfer vehicles of "teracoya THANK", an English conversation after-school for children operated in-house in-house in Chiryu City.
A human sensor that detects human movement from the temperature difference between people and the surrounding area is installed in three places in the ceiling of the car.
When the vehicle's engine is turned off, the door is closed, and when a person's movement is detected after a certain period of time, a warning notice is automatically sent.
By linking the state of the engine and the door and the information, it prevents false detections as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered number, it is displayed on a chat on a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and we are careful not to make mistakes such as missed.
The demonstration experiment will continue until the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, chief of the 2nd Division of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out, "During the experiment, we have seen issues around the area other than the system."
He was able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving, for example.
"If you can expand the solution," we can put our efforts into it.
The trigger for the development of the left-to-let prevention system was the incident of leaving the shuttle bus leaving one after another in the country.
Employees with young children suggested that there was something they could do to protect the safety of children.
The company decided to develop the technology to make use of the know-how such as information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors cultivated through the business related to factory automation (FA).
FUJI's prevention system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to a pick-up vehicle, it aims to lower the hurdle of introduction and spread it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Editorial] The Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka start-up, which was scheduled for the beginning of FY2023, has been postponed, and the town development of the town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture is beginning to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station is located, the location of the station is not shown in detail, and the city planning including the improvement of the surrounding area is still under way.
It is expected that it will take a long time to formulate a plan, and it is necessary to publish it as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station scheduled for Obama City is the only new station development west of Tsuruga.
The Japan Railway Construction and Transportation Facilities Development Support Organization indicated that the location of the station was roughly two to five kilometers in radius around JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The location of the station and the route were determined in the winter of the 22nd year.
In Obama City, projects related to the Shinkansen are in full swing in FY21 with a view to the opening of Tsuruga and the opening of Obama in the future.
In the initial budget for FY22, the number of projects will be further increased, and the city is planning to promote town planning with the aim of announcing the location of the new station.
However, the location of the new station is not yet indicated.
The city is expected to spend three million yen in this fiscal year's budget to consider land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station and formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that it will not be implemented.
The urban planning centering on the new station "takes a long time in the consensus of citizens" (city representative).
Echizen City is an example of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to the existing JR station, but it seems that it takes a considerable amount of time to put together the overall concept.
There is concern that the sooner the publication is made as it is, the shorter the preparation period for opening the business, and the impact on the surrounding area improvement will occur.
Before the location of the new station, there was a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a civic group in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a signature to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism asking for the withdrawal of the blank sheet of the extension plan.
In the Ishikawa Prefectural Government, there were calls for reconsideration of the Maibara route due to the postponement of construction, and there were many movements to return to the starting point of the route setting that had been settled, and it was difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture was a monolith.
The location of the new station is unknown and the timing of the opening of the station is unclear, and there are concerns that future momentum will be affected if the location of the new station is unclear.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue his government's request for the early opening of the entire line, but the voices of the area along the line, which is calling for the start of construction as soon as possible, will be indispensable.
The indifference of the saying, 'One day the Shinkansen will pass through (to the west of Tsuruga) will pass, it is impossible to move the national government and neighboring prefectures.
I want the enthusiasm to keep my voice up.
The chocolate section for Valentine's Day, where tastings have been revived for the first time in three years = February 9th, Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
Ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14th, the over-the-counter price of chocolates is rising due to the surge in raw materials and packaging materials, and sales in the high price range for their own "reward chocolates" for themselves, families, and friends are selling well in the high price range.
Retailers and confectionery stores in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that put local colors, high-class textures, and commitment to materials at the forefront.
Seibu Fukui Store (Fukui City) opened a special sales floor on the 6th floor on January 25th.
Until the 14th, about forty brands, including ten confectionery stores in the prefecture, are on sale.
It is said that chocolates using Fukui's local sake and sand products with raw chocolates sandwiched between raw chocolates and cookies are popular.
According to the store representative, the over-the-counter prices of many of the products have increased by about ten percent year-on-year.
As for this year's trend, "There are many products that are particular about the ingredients and bring out the sense of luxury in the package. As for consumer trends, there is a tendency to buy for yourself and your family and enjoy eating and comparing."
Even in the headwinds of price hikes, sales in the high-price range are said to be strong.
⇒Average increase of 25yen per grain due to high price
"We are trying to create a sales floor where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself," says the person in charge.
The store has been selling recommended sweets on a daily basis since January 26th, and has resumed tastings for the first time in three years.
At the end of last year, the Western Confectionery Club (headquarters in Maruoka-cho, Sakai City), which manufactures and sells Western confectionery, introduced the original chocolate series "KISEKI" jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate manufacturer for the first time for the Valentine's Day business.
It is characterized by its fruity taste with its commitment to cacao beans and suppresses bitterness, and is sold for three thousand yen in three pieces and three thousand yen in nine pieces.
Ryoma Takakura, Director and Purchasing Manager of the company, says, "While the culture of Giri Chocolate is gradually fading, there is a demand to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We will increase the added value of products and try to differentiate them."

The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle against Heisen-ji Temple = Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inuide area of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, where a large-scale gyugahara manor used to be located.
Ushigahara-jo Castle is said to have been built on the hillside of Mt. Nabetoko in the district in order to prepare for the battle against Heisen-ji Temple, which was in conflict with manors in the Kamakura period.
It appears in the military chronicle 'Taiheiki' (Records of the Great Peace).
There are no documents related to Ushigahara-jo Castle, but the following contents are written in 'Echizen-Ushihara Jito Jito' (Jijutsu of the Echizen-Kyugen-no-Jichu jito) in the Taiheiki-maki (The Book of the Great Peace).
Ukyo no Tokiharu ARASHIKAWA, an official of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was dispatched to Ono as a jito (manjito (manjito (manjito).
In the 1333rd year, the Rokuhara Tandai, which was established in Kyoto to watch over the Imperial Court and control of the western country, was overthrown by Takauji ASHIKAGA, and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was destroyed by Yoshisada NISHIDA.
Upon hearing the news that the Rokuhara Tandai had perished, Tokiharu's retainers fled as soon as they heard, and only about twenty people remained.
In the meantime, the monks and soldiers of Heisen-ji Temple attacked him.
When Tokiharu brought his wife and two children into the river, he followed them to self-harm.

A cat-shaped serving robot introduced at "Iwashio Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store".
Adorable expressions are said to be popular with family customers = Ote 2chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from labor shortages, there is a growing movement to introduce a serving robot that carries food to the audience.
In addition to being useful for "non-contact" customer service to save labor and prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection, the adorable expressions of the robot are said to be popular with family customers.
Restaurants and related parties have said, "Local restaurants are difficult to secure employees and part-time jobs, and the serving robot will become even more popular."
“Jin, gin, and gingi-shun.”
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face on the screen carries a dish and runs smoothly through the store.
When I arrived at the audience table, I talked to the customer, saying, "I brought the food I ordered, Nya."
"Iwashio Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2nd Street, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
When the robot is waiting near the kitchen, the dish ordered from the customer is put on the table number on the screen, and it runs autonomously to the table and delivers it.
It has an AI (artificial intelligence) voice function, etc., and the expression of the cat's face on the screen is rich because it reacts when the customer touches it.
The Bonta Group, which runs the same store, has introduced a serving robot at two stores, including the same store.
President Toshiyuki Saito said that the reason for the introduction was that "the labor shortage is the biggest problem" and emphasized that it is part of improving productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but the introduction has reduced to 21 to 22 percent.
The robot also has the role of collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which has led to the efficiency of cleaning up after cleaning up, and "family members and children are also happy and have a publicity effect," he adds.
The Rokima Hoshiyama Fukui store, a yakiniku and hormone pot in Araki Shinbocho, Fukui City, also introduced a serving robot in August.
Mr. Nagafuku Hoshiyama, president of Songsan Shoten, which he runs, said, "Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, it will not come easily. I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
At the Fukui store, it is operated by dividing the zone where employees serve and the range of robot delivery.
The cost of a robot lease is about the same as the wages of a part-time job.
In order to save labor, in addition to robots, the store is also considering self-checkout by adopting an ordering system using a tablet terminal.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the "customer service" for restaurants and other facilities is 6.94x, with the effective job openings ratio by job openings by occupation in December, and it is a job type with a high sense of labor shortage.
A person in charge of the Internet System (Takagi Chuo 2chome, Fukui City), which is a distributor of serving food delivery robots, says, "Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the shortage of workers at restaurants in the prefecture is worsening, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama said, "It will be even more difficult to secure employees in suburban stores in rural areas in the future, and I think that serving robots will become widespread."
[Editorial] Echizen Town makes an ending note and distributes it to the townspeople who wish to do so.
When I published the "Okuyami Handbook" last year, which covers the procedures necessary for the death of a family member, the inheritance list table, and the family tree, etc., it was said that it was triggered by many people who came to receive it for themselves.
In various parts of the prefecture, courses on how to write the ending notes and how to organize life are often held, and it seems that "end of life" is firmly established in the prefecture.
The ending note in Echizen-cho is 35pages.
The chapter begins with a review of one's own history, and describes the current state of health, asset status, future nursing care, hope for end-of-life medical care, requests for funerals and graves, etc.
There is also a section that writes what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message to your loved ones.
Thirty-five pages is a pain, but you don’t have to fill every page.
What do you want to write the most for your family and the people around you?
The key is to make the purpose clear.
In bookstores, a variety of notebooks are commercially available according to the purpose, and it is said that it is easy to start writing from where you can write.
It is said that the word "end-of-life" was born in 2009, compared to job hunting.
Two years later, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death will come suddenly", and more people are preparing for their own end and end-of-life.
More than ten years since then.
The new coronavirus pandemic that has hit the world has not subsided yet.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has raised prices, and electricity prices this winter have jumped to unexpected prices.
On the other hand, wages have not risen to the level of current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, funeral expenses, nursing care fees, and grave management that could be shared by kyodai and relatives, but now it is not uncommon for one child to be born.
In addition, the longer the life expectancy is greatly extended compared to a long time ago, but the dilemma is that the risk of dementia and nursing care increases as the older you get.
I would like to keep in mind that this is the background to the fact that the end-of-life has become established without ending a temporary basis is the rise of social unrest.
In any case, everyone wants to feel that they do not want to put too much burden on their partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword for ending notes, but you should not be too self-obsessive.
I do not want to write my wishes and requests secretly, but I want to consult with my family once and prepare for that time peacefully.

At the graduation ceremony, he expressed the idea that it is not necessary in principle for children and teachers to wear masks = February 10th, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture
On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) established a policy at the graduation ceremony that it is "basic that students should not wear masks" to wear masks.
The junior high school chief of a large school said, "It is actually difficult to take a wide distance between students, and I am worried about how to respond. Some students feel anxious about removing the mask."
In response to reports about wearing a mask at the graduation ceremony, this topic is also being raised among teachers.
On the other hand, one elementary school principal predicted, "If the government decides, it will not be worn. If it is excluded from chorus, it may be realistically possible to respond."
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to ease measures, such as allowing students to participate in the self-restraint, and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high school is scheduled to be held in early March, and the public small school is scheduled to hold a ceremony in the middle of the same month.
The prefectural board of education and the municipal board of education will wait for the official notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Security, and judge the response.
In addition, from the new school year this spring, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has decided not to wear a mask in all school education activities.
The head of the elementary school said, "Children are confused when they suddenly do not have a mask from one day. First of all, after deciding that 'wear is free,' it is natural that the number of children gradually removes it gradually increases."

On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities from April in accordance with the government's new government guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, there will be no masks in chorus, physical education classes, and club activities.
During FY2022, we will seek infection control measures according to the current hygiene management manual, and we will disseminate the precautions from April onwards to the Board of Education and school sites in the future.
Graduates, faculty, and students participating in graduation ceremonies should not wear masks, based on the implementation of ventilation and other measures for graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, and high schools, and universities.

(1) Suicide prevention is a "life-saving" activity.
(2) There are a lot of "human rights violations" behind the suicides.
(3) A suicidal person is a victim of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens living outside their jurisdiction as "outers" and treat them poorly.
(5) Imposing a mentally ill person, such as depression, is treated as an "accident" even if he commits suicide.
(6) "Safety care obligations" in high-risk areas of suicide are oblivion and are running toward commercialism.
(7) The part that cannot be scientifically proven in the doctrines of emerging religious organizations is deceit, and the act of threatening the other party and providing money and goods by telling the future is extortion.
Religious organizations that are committing this criminal act of "fraud and extortion" should be made public and excluded.
Therefore, in the comments sent from those who subscribed to this book, "I was moved by the strong mentality of those who are working on this activity", "This former police officer is a guide among police officers", "It is a living bodhisattva who supports as well as my own relatives even though it is a stranger to there", etc.
When I saw the photo of the newspaper article, I burst into tears, "What do you think?"
I hear that the number of suicides of people who have been cornered by the coronavirus pandemic is increasing.
It's really sad.
All people are like that person.
I want it to be a society where you can live your life happily.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all the staff who are doing their best to those who have pain that they want to die.
I think that this activity is an activity that abuses both the mind and body, but please continue to call on yourself and continue to call on yourself in the future.
Thank you very much.
Kashiko
I hope that you, as readers, will become the gatekeepers of life in the area.

The man is 38-year-old Kenji Shimada, a company employee who lives in the city.
It started posting on social media (SNS) in March 2021.
Capybara is one of the world's largest rats, and he is good at swimming with water between his fingers.
In Happijan, a total of three males and two females have been raised since the 18th century, and they can be observed and fed up close.
Shimada learned about capybara five or six years ago.
When he saw the video of himself relaxing in the hot spring, he was shocked to see what this animal is.
He was drawn to a charming expression and gesture like a human being.
After that, I heard that it would be raised in Happijan, and I was looking forward to being able to see it up close.
I started taking photos in earnest about three years ago, when I bought a SLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of capybara, and you do not miss the shutter opportunity such as the appearance of shaking your body and draining the water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has risen to about 830, and I look back and say, "I took this much well."
I wonder if you learned Mr. Shimada while you went through, or you approached the male Yamato and cried "Kyuru-Kyu-Kyu".
"It's cute and happy," Shimada's love of chappy is only deepening.
They also enjoy interacting with capybara lovers all over the country through SNS, such as showing off their best shots every month.

It's snowing again.
It seems to be influenced by a low pressure system on the south coast that moves eastward from the Japanese archipelago, not a cold wave from the north.
It is still a short day since I experienced the unusual cold of the 24th to 26th of last month, and I can not be careful ▼ Even the same cold will be more bearable to the people of the Republic of Turkey who were hit by a major earthquake.
The building collapsed in an instant.
More than twenty thousand people have been killed so far, along with neighboring Syria, and many people are still left in the rubble.
It was started in 1890, in the disaster of the warship Ertulul, which was dispatched to Japan by the Ottoman Empire at that time.
The fact that the residents of Kushimoto-cho, Wakayama Prefecture in the sea area of the sea area, helped the crew, and the fact that they took care of them is introduced in movies and novels. ▼About one hundred years after this accident, a Turkish aircraft was sent to rescue a Japanese hostage by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War, and it is rewarding to repay it.
For those who have experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake, this suffering can be shared.
I want to calm down and pay attention to the recovery and recovery.

Bellino Hotel Subsidy Unauthorized receipts Accommodation support project of the prefecture and city has already returned the full amount|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
The prefectural government and Ichinoseki City announced on the 10th that Belino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame, the same city) had been using the facility inappropriately for about a year from October 2021 in their subsidy grant projects to discount the accommodation fee for travelers.

Introduction of plant research predecessors Hayaike Mineyama collection materials City Cultural Properties Center Special Exhibition [Hanamaki]|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
A special exhibition featuring the people who laid the foundation for plant research on Mt. Hayaike Mine, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, "People who introduced the flowers of Hayaike Peak - Hayaike Peak Plant Research Small History-" is held at the City Cultural Properties Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City until the 12th.
The photographs of the researchers are the collection of valuable specimens collected by our predecessors, and the footprints of our predecessors who were involved in plant research on Mt. Hayaike Mine are introduced.
The plant study of Mt. Hayaike began with Karl Johan Maximović (1827-91), a Russian plant researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Chonosuke SUGAWA (1842-1925) from Shiwa Town, who collected plants under the guidance of Maximović.
Unable to roam the country for foreigners, Maximović asked Sugawa to collect the art and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa supported his research after returning to Maximović, and led to the presentation of "Himekozakura", "Nanbuto Uchisou" and "Miyama Yamabukishoma" unique to Mt. Hayaike.
After that, Tomiyaro Makino (1862-1957), a modern plant taxonologist, announced "Nanbutrano", "Kobano Tsumekusa", "Nanbu Inu Nazuna" based on the collection of local researchers in 1903, and "Kato Hakobe" which he himself climbed Mt. Hayaike Mine in 05 (38) and named it.
The exhibits show that many researchers have revealed valuable alpine plants.
He also introduced Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874-1948), who was the head of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 27 years, and Jichiro Tamagawa (1914-88), who was a curator of the Osako Town Mountain Museum and was also involved in the publication of "Plants of Mt. Hayaike".
Sohei Yoshida, curator of the center, said, "The background to the name of each plant in Hayaike Mineyama is the accumulation of research and the connections between people. You can trace the connections between researchers spreading from the countryside to the whole country."
The exhibition consists of four chapters, and the first chapter focuses on the characteristics of Mt. Hayaike from the geological point of view based on the research of Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation for Japanese geology.

Idlib province in northwestern Syria, which was damaged by a major earthquake, on the 9th (provided by local residents)
Gaziantep (Southern Turkey) - More than twenty-one thousand people have been confirmed dead in the two countries for the earthquake in southern Turkey, according to authorities in Turkey and neighboring Syria.
In the midst of severe cold, the rescue of survivors from collapsed buildings has become more difficult over time.
A hard-fought search was underway in the affected areas.
The United Nations has brought supplies through the Turkish border to Syria's northwestern province of Idlib, Syria, which was affected by the earthquake on Monday, for the first time since the earthquake struck on Monday.
Idlib province was the last stronghold of dissidents in the Syrian civil war against the Assad regime, and there were fears that international support would be out of reach.
Rescue operations continue at the disaster sites in both countries, such as using heavy machinery, but it is difficult.
Many people are said to be buried in the rubble, and the death toll is likely to increase further.
Turkish authorities said it had confirmed 17764 deaths in Turkey.
Together with the death toll of more than three thousand Syrians, it is a disaster that surpasses the Great Earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which killed more than seventeen thousand people.
Miyako City plans to take its own support measures to subsidize energy costs such as electricity, gas, and gasoline for the cost of electricity, gas, gasoline, and other energy expenses for businesses in the city, which are struggling to secure profits due to soaring fuel and prices.
We will invest our own financial resources as an emergency measure and support the local economy in a difficult environment.
The target is businesses in all industries (except agricultural, forestry and fishermen, electricity, and gas supply companies).
It is necessary to ensure that the profit margin for the fiscal year that ended just before the previous fiscal year has decreased from the previous fiscal year.
The subsidy amount is one million yen per business operator for expenses for the six consecutive months between April and March 2022, with the upper limit of one million yen per business operator in the direction of providing one-half of the increase compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year.
We expect to see about eight hundred benefits.

In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year and aims to formulate a plan ahead of the six other remote islands in the prefecture.
The second meeting, as in the first round, is closed to the public, except for the opening.
According to Mr. Ando, who responded to the interview after the meeting, the meeting confirmed the greenhouse gas emissions of the airport.
The two sides agreed to negotiate targets and introduce renewable energy in line with the guidelines of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
According to the handout, the CO2 emissions of the airport equipment and vehicles in the 13th fiscal year, which is the standard, are 1476tn (excluding aircraft).
Among them, the amount of lighting and air conditioning at seven facilities, including the airport terminal building, accounted for about ninety percent of the amount of lighting and air conditioning, followed by 84tons of aviation lights and 71t of airport vehicles.
The council will proceed with discussions on reducing the emissions of these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando said, "The direction of the committee members is consistent, and I would like to compile the interim report firmly first."
In the future, we will formulate a promotion plan after listening to the opinions of the interim report proposal at the third meeting and the final report proposal at the fourth meeting.
"Sakasama Real Estate" Okinoerabu Branch Office Opens the Flow of Bringing People to the Island|Society and Economy |Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Opening event where you deepened your understanding of "Sakasama Real Estate" = 8th, China Town
[Oki-no-erabu General Bureau] On the 8th, the community space "entaku" in the community space of China Town, which visualizes the thoughts of people who want to challenge by renting vacant houses and vacant stores, and recruiting lenders, and the opening event of the Okinoerabu branch office of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate" that recruits landlords was held on the 8th.
The management company explained the outline of the service through the talk session.
Masahiro Okubo, representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), who is responsible for the operation of the bureau, said, "By doing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we hope to create a movement and flow to attract people to the entire island."
In contrast to the usual real estate procedures, Sakasama Real Estate is a mechanism that discloses the information of people who want to borrow, contacts them from the lender, and if they reach an agreement, they contract themselves.
On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) was operated as a demonstration experiment that is responsible for excavating potential vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses.
The bureau was the first in Kyushu for the seventh time.
For the first time in the country on a remote island.
About twenty people from On-Co and Tsuginova, staff from On-Co and Tsuginova, Wadomari, and officials from the town halls of China, and local residents participated in the event.
Representative Director Okubo explained the process behind the opening of the bureau, saying, "As the movement to attract people from outside the island is becoming more active, I thought that if we could use vacant houses and vacant stores, the town would be more exciting from there."
"I want to connect with people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and help us advance the efforts as many as possible, even one case," he said.
Mr. Takeshi Mizutani, the representative of On-Co, pointed out the precautions for management, saying, "It is necessary to discuss how local people want to do in this area, what kind of people want to come, and what to choose based on the criteria, etc., taking care of each empty house."
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will gather," he said, calling on islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

Do you wear it on the day of the yt?
Since there is a picture of the United States of Odaiba in the same costume, yes.
I didn’t know if I was going to wear it on the day of the y-h-h-h-
I want you to tell me your favorite soba and udon noodles
Soba soba is sashimi soba, isn't it?
I also like the buckwheat noodles.
Udon is tempura udon.
Because of the poor, shrimp tempura udon is a great treat.
Too persistent
About a half o'clock, it's gone.

I can hear it at all, it didn't work at all, even if I plugged my ear.
I can't sleep, the painful, painful hell, really exists.
How long will it last???
Isn't it called spring lightning, snow-falling?
it's over soon.
I have been to several different dentists, but when I sit in that treatment chair, there are doctors and dental hygienists who talk from behind a little diagonally.
I am wondering whether it is better to look back, but I think that it is rude if you keep facing the front posture because it is tough and hard to face the back all the time.
Do you know anyone?
How are you doing?
Not only dentists, but also barbers and perma shops talk face to face.
Which material is cooler, polyester 100 or dry rayon?
Dry rayon is excellent and cool
Tell me.
who joined the company from April
What can you do to become a good person in the world?
thank you.
It is better to become a company force by mastering the work given to you as soon as possible, rather than thinking about becoming a good person for the world.
Is your belly watch accurate?
The internal clock and the abdominal clock are not crazy.
I would like to request repair because the front plate of the door of the washbasin has peeled off, but which store should I ask?
Please teach me.
There is a decorative board in the home center, so I will try to size it, process it, and repair and replace it by myself
When you go to the tax office to submit the tax return documents, you do not need to be color printing, do you?
yes.
When will the amount I applied for in the tax return be transferred to my account?
I think it will be transferred in about 2 or 3 weeks.
I will receive a postcard contact that I will transfer with a postcard first, so please register the passbook when it comes, because it is transferred.
You just have to wait for the postcard (notification).
Please tell me how to verify your LINE ID.
Select the home on the lower left, then press the gear icon in the upper right corner to see it in the top profile.

Can I purchase a ticketless limited express ticket at E5489 using a VISA LINE PAY prepaid card?
Good evening.
JR West's e5489 ticketless limited express ticket will be paid by credit card.
Prepaid cards cannot be used.
It’s been a long time coming, but are you sure it’s okay?
It's vegetable juice.
It also depends on how you save it.
If you put it in the refrigerator, you can drink it even after 2-3 days, but if you leave it outside or leave it at room temperature, I think it is better to dispose of it.
If something happens to your body later, it will be difficult.
Why can't I eat and drink at "Kissa Donburi" even though I am unemployed and monkey brother of "Abataro Don Bros."?

Thank you for your cooperation.

Can you enjoy the movie Promise of Neverland with only the movie without knowing the contents before and after?
You can enjoy it.
Because it's a simple story.
It is a story that runs away from a monster that feeds on humans.
I think that nurses wear plain clothes when they go to work, but is it okay with sandals and bare feet?
Well, you can change everything anyway, and it's not strange to go to work, so it's okay if it's not strange, can't you?
I envy houses where no one comes, but is there anything to lose in a house like this?
I will not be able to clean the house.
The hospitality to the guests will also become unfamiliar.
About Instagram.
I currently have about ten thousand followers, but if you don’t know this, do you think it’s amazing?
Or do you not think anything?
How does it feel?
I think it's amazing.
It is a miracle for ordinary people.
I think he was doing something special.
A problem and a setback.
I didn't have much time to exercise, so I bought it to rely on the popular pressurized innerwear.
Body type is H175m W80kg L size I bought.
It's quite a struggle to wear at first, but I think it's okay if you get used to it.
I used it for a few days, but now I am using other pressure innerwear due to a problem.
The problem is, if the arm is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the second arm) is too tight and becomes a little before congestion, itchy.
2, The lower abdomen is loosely I stopped using it due to the above two problems.
It is quite tight in terms of comfort, but there is no problem even if you sleep while wearing it.
Deals for those who agree
Even 158cm and 50kg were OK.
But the skeleton was large and muscular, and it didn't suit me.
Since it is not a three-dimensional construction such as the buttocks, it is easy to create a strange gap or it does not fit easily.
I always felt like I had to lift it up.
I think it would be good if you have a body shape like a stick.
Do you think it is a reassuring thinness in terms of thickness?
It was not a henna or a feeling that it seemed to break, but I was able to make it refreshing by booting in even with tight knee high boots.
it's lovely.
I didn't want to have too much skin on my upper body, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit, so I met him.
The upper part is fashionable with the back of the braided and one-point marks on the hem.
I'm happy to choose in two ways whether to wear a bikini or shorts on top of it (^.
^) I just arrived, and I just tried it on, so it is not in the water, so I do not know durability or what it is like when it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is also solid, and I thought that it was a bargain that was this price.
There was no wire on the bust part, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a hard core at the bottom of the putt.
However, it does not hurt even if you wear it, and it will follow the bust properly, so I think it looks good even when you move.
Did you change the model from without a putt to being?
(^.
I’m looking forward to getting into the water – thank you.
45kg 156cmM size is a little larger.
The raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but I think that it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
There were two rain visors to prevent my face from getting wet.
The strength was fine, and I was able to use it safely even on a bicycle in the storm.
It was not broken after use.
I put it in a compression bag and carry it in a compact state.
It was really more than I expected at this price.
I was able to fit it safely.
It was attached to the CLA 180 Shooting Break in the 2016 model.
The wearing method is possible even for amateurs if you read YOU tube and instruction manual.
Note that if you loosen the torque screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I fell one and went missing.
After that, when the gray connector is sandwiched between brown and red and green wiring, if you do it with a thin tip such as a radio pliers, the force does not enter evenly and the plastic is broken as shown in the photo, and it is impossible to install it.
When I called the support, the next day I mailed a new cable to the company and it is a company that is very supportive.
When I tried again, it worked well when I focused on a wide pliers like the one in the manual photo.
When I returned the last main unit to the car, I put a little bit of a lump in the storage of the wiring, but I managed to attach it somehow.
DVD, TV, and navigation can be seen while driving without problems after wearing it.
I think that it is a very cost-effective product because it costs more than eighty thousand yen if you ask at a Deller, and it costs more than forty thousand yen even at a specialty store.
Below the price
To be honest, I do not know why it is so highly evaluated First of all, the cotton in the middle is poly, but there are fluffy parts and fluffy parts in the cushions It seems that it has already been worn out. I think that there are few Watts that have been worn out overall, and I thought that I tried to use it, but I think that if the product that the head and the pillow part are integrated, it will not fit or not, I think that the pillow and the pillow pillow are not a failure separately I thought that the pillow and the hug pillow are not a failure, but I bought it for 3600yen at the time sale, but I want to return it.
No, no, no, no.
Goods arrive.
I had to use it quickly.
You can milk it properly without any problems with the feeling of use.
However, there are times when you feel that the sound is a little annoying, and there are times when the reaction of the power button is bad.
I don't care because I can use it without problems, but people who are concerned may be worried.
It is not super quiet 😅 If you use it in the middle of the night, you may be a little careful.
In addition, I was worried about whether the attached tube and the part connecting the machine and the part connecting to the tube would enter the tube, but I entered it in the form of pushing in 😂 I think that it is easy to carry because it is lightweight!
You need a trick to bubbling up...
I am not sure whether it is the worst compatibility with my hair quality or the performance problem of this shampoo, but it does not bubble at all in normal use.
(The shampoo I have used so far has been bubbling without problems even if I use it normally) So, here is the solution I found ↓ 1 First of all, I picked up the shampoo less than usual and let the whole hair fit in.
(At this point, it does not foam at a level where not one of the bubbles appears.) 2 Wash off the hair once, then take the shampoo in the appropriate amount and blend it into the hair.
(This finally bubbles normally) Well, in short, it is washed twice in short lol The capacity of the shampoo itself is quite small, so it is a trick to reduce the amount of shampoo as much as possible for the first time ...
It is clear that I bought a high-quality shampoo so far, but there was clearly a feeling that the texture of the hair was better.
However, it is an honest feeling that I was not satisfied with the general evaluation.
The Quatrov Botanico series is a pity because it was taken care of by the face wash goods.
The poor cost of the cospa that can be washed twice even though the capacity is small.
In addition, considering the scent that seems to be won't be fun for everyone, I'll give you two stars to be a little strict here.
Difficult to evaluate.
There are negapozes, and the evaluation is difficult.
The front side of the blade becomes clean with the cleaner of the blade.
I think that the razor and matching with the original blade with good accuracy is good.
Poji: As intended, you can remove dirt on the blade, such as sebum, soap scum, etc.
(Only on the front side) If the dirt becomes sharper, it will last a long time.
Nega: The life of the smoother is extremely reduced.
Titanium coats, ceramic coats, etc., those coated at the end of the cutting edge are more likely to peel off the coating.
(If you use shave two or three times, the coating will almost peel off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner afterwards.)
Razors that say do not wipe the cutting edge should be careful.
When you can substitute it with a fall prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that you can put under furniture to prepare for an earthquake, etc., it seems to be cost-performance.
※ I use it and the life of the razor of 20-30% is up.
It is difficult to judge when discarding the razor blade, but I think that the damage to the blade is added to the blade by the beard shaving, and the cutting edge is rattled.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness down by dirt.
(There are times when you feel that you are sharpening with a cleaner. It seems that it feels like it is sharpened, but it seems to feel that it is so that it is removed with a small rust.)
I was caught up in a TV commercial...
I bought it when I saw the face of a fairly elderly woman pulling up just by applying it once in a TV commercial.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little firmer than ordinary gel, and I used it after wiping it off with a pre-rolution.
At first it is sticky and disgusting, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will enter your skin unexpectedly.
There was almost no stickiness after entering, and it felt like my skin was sucking on my hands.
The lift-up was not like the TV.
I felt the Hari feeling once and for all.
Since it is a super dry skin, this one is still not enough, and I have been using it since using a certain Moisrich Sage72 before this.
It just feels moist.
I was expecting that the sludge of the pores would also be covered, but it is not covered.
I think that there is also a rip if it is effective to use a bottle.
It must have been hard to put together, but...
It is a work that summarizes the statements of politicians of the past few years.
After reading this, I was somewhat convinced that that statement was, after all, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
However, if you think about the value as a reading material, it is subtle that it is enough to say that it is enough just to call "fact check" that the authors call.
To be honest, I read it and it is not fun.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major disadvantage of this book was the method.
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call “facts” here is forever true.
I felt that it was quite suspicious from the writing that they were aware of the fragility of "fact check" (or even say that it was tactible).
At this level, the current Japanese journalists' perception of the "facts" makes me feel a little dark.
It seems that many people are recommended, but it may be suitable for those who want to know a little about the contents of this book.
If there are readers like reviewers who are interested in the "fact check" conducted by the current Japanese media, I think this book will not fit.
For those who do not increase their points in the test.
At my school, the political economy was a print method, and it was really boring in the form of a class like studying while being done, and I suddenly became disliked the political economy.
To be honest, this book saved me.
Centered in 3rd grade this year.
I chose this as a one-hour study partner on a day-long trip to school after I bought it in March.
The first impression is easy to understand, and it ends with a word.
We are in God’s kingdom.
After one lap, I asked the past question, and I was seventy, the average of forty at that time.
I was surprised at the stone itself.
I grew up eating something strange.
What I can get from this reference book is not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also my own strength and motivation for studying, etc. I felt that it is rising from the skin.
Thank you for letting me really meet you.
Security
Eight years ago, I experienced the entrance picking attempt twice and took security measures.
This is a replacement for the camera I bought eight years ago.
Previously, the infrared irradiation 30m type (other companies) was used.
This product was written by others, but the distance that can recognize the face at night is about 5m.
I also agree.
I just arrived and did not set it up, but it is the stage where I compared the reflection of the camera and checked the defect.
The image quality is much higher than the camera eight years ago (of course).
I displayed it in four parts on a 32inch monitor, but if you maximize the shooting size, it is a problem.
So far, there are no defects in the product.
For those who are considering a level that can recognize faces other than crime prevention, you may be particularly dissatisfied with nighttime shooting, but this price is the highest level!
I'm using security measures, but I don't even require facial recognition.
Because if you wear a mask or mask, you don't know (especially at night).
Professional burglars have knowledge of security cameras.
Even small, high-performance cameras and recordings can be distinguished.
On the other hand, you will be in trouble if you are not a professional.
However, recent burglars are bold and clever, so we recommend using them together with various crime prevention goods instead of relying only on cameras.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained for about 1,500yen at the home center (the latest is very bright with six attached).
Since it is solar, there is no need for electricity, but it does not light up until the morning in winter, so there are three 100V human-like LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30m that can recognize a figure.
In addition, if you think that the camera is small in the daytime security, the intimidating effect will fade because the camera is small, I think that you need to cover it with ingenuity.
I'm putting up a sticker with "24hours security cameras are on and on."
It is the original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
It is more effective for manufacturer products than to paste what is sold at the home center.
The place to put it is a thief's intrusion route that can not be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, the explanation of the net setting is difficult to understand, so I made it negative.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up and setting up, I will add it.
The more painful it is to read, the more I sympathize
The social situation may be somewhat better than her if she was born in the 82nd year in Japan, but the situation is still far from equal because the Equal Employment Rights Act is enforced.
As I read on, the painful memories that I had survived as a member of society through discrimination, which seemed to be true, and it became suffocating.
It depicts the suffering of all women who try to live as a human being, not as a woman, in a feudal society, not as a woman.
Isn't it time for women at least to stop emotional conflict and face this society with their shoulders together?
“I think men are the worst” drama.
The story of a hero who was sexually abused by his real father when he was a child.
Of course, even as an adult, he continues to drag the wound.
All the men who come out are the worst.
The husband of the main character who seems to be gentle and family-like is also the lowest in a sense.
There is spoiler ↓ Even if you know that the main character's sister is receiving DV to her husband, ignore it, and the in-law sister-in-law finally came to the police to sue her husband with courage, but the husband of the main character who is a police officer is a police officer goes through, and it is a development that is irritated by men.
The mother of the main character, who pretends to be blurred, knows that her husband (the real father of the main character) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter does not know it (publicly the death of her father is a drug overdose).
In short, it seems that the daughter did not receive counseling after the death of the rapist father, and it is natural that the main character goes crazy.
Does the daughter of the main character want to hear about her dead grandfather?
Are you worried about the dead man at this age?
Too much in the drama?
A few years ago, a summer hit by a heat wave in France Many elderly people died, and hospitals and facilities contacted their daughter and son, but many French people said that they could not take it because they were on vacation, and it was reported that the morgue in Paris was full.
These people are “dry.”
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that it was "dry".
French is completely different from the United States, and there are many things that give a good aftertave to the lingering part, but there are relatively many scenes that it is better to cut this, I watched it while fasting.
Professional Boundaries
If the precise calculation and the unreadable unexpected accident were someone's life-related, they would have been prepared to be worthy of their own bet, even if they had calculated it from the beginning to some extent.
The script that embodies such a subtle turbulent drama, such as how far she goes to fight her own struggles that are not shown in the open place and how far she deceives those around her in order to pass through her own beliefs, was wonderful.
And yet, Jessica’s performance is really great.
No matter what you look at, there is no mishap.
It's really a professional job.
I felt it was used, and then it broke down.
I have used three so far, but this product broke in a good and bad way, in a good way and in a bad way.
The reason for choosing this product was the first 2200mA built-in veporizer, but the battery ran out in three sessions of 200oC five minutes.
The second USB port is bad.
The loading is unnecessary.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but when I re-installed the battery about fifteen times (the USB terminal was using the battery with the charger so that the USB terminal did not break), it became difficult to turn on the power, probably because the contact became worse.
When the lid is pressed, the power is turned on.
If you are an ICOS user, you may have experience.
That's the symptom.
Although it is also in the notice, the battery does not use batteries other than the attached.
The nails and the catch part are like shavings, so there seems to be no crookedness.
So I returned it in about ten days.
I bought without the Starry logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the contents compared with this.
Looks Size, same.
The same goes for chambers and draw.
Liquid crystal This one is more beautiful.
It may be newer than the logo.
Vibe This is modest.
Like the vibrator on your phone.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibrator is big.
A cheap Chinese phone.
This product is also Chinese...
The attached items are a little different.
This is the case of the liquid.
Without logo, lump like steel wool.
It's roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks down quickly, it will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange, but I could only choose a return, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
Only ear rubber, but ear rubber
This rubber doesn't really hurt.
It is the best mask of the same type that I have used so far in terms of the ear.
Even with flat rubber, it is twisted, and the part of the twisted helicopter is rubmed to the base of the ear, and it may hurt more than the round rubber, but I think that this product is not only soft in the feel, but the length is also hard to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, and not only fits, but there is a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower edge on the chin = in front of the mouth, so it is difficult to feel suffocating.
Because it fits your face size, it will be.
I don't know if everyone will be the same, but if you think that all of them are different in small size and think that none of them are good, I think that it is a good idea to try it once.
When I opened the outer box, it was in the central slit vinyl like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides caught and it was difficult to take out, so I reduced the number of stars by one.
The dealer's response is a star1
The price and taste are impeccable, but despite the fact that I specify it by the date, I was distrustful of the response of the contractor who ignored it and sent it.
I bought a drink in addition to this product.
I always know the delivery person to buy it on Amazon.
In particular, I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible because it carries heavy items up, but it is ruined.
The transportation company is said to be difficult because of Amazon, but I think that there is one thing that can be done on the user side.
Disappointed with the arrogant dealer.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering purchasing, include waste costs.
There are a lot of dissatisfaction and I don't think it can be used for
I think it is good to consider the cost of disposal.
As a reference, it seems that some local governments have centers that accept free and cheap and bulky garbage if you bring them in.
[Sit comfort] The seat surface is slightly tilted to the left and glared further, so sitting and very tired.
If you move even a little, you will make a lot of noise.
It is noisy and can not be used at night.
This is the biggest problem, and I feel that I can not continue to use it.
[Assembly] Assembly instruction manuals are only described in rough drawings.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
There is no explanation of the direction when installing the seat surface and the strut fixing platform There is a person who says that it tilts forward in the review, but there is a possibility that the direction when installing the seat surface and the strut fixed table is the opposite.
When installed correctly, the lever for height adjustment is turned backwards on the right hand side, and the dial that adjusts the position of the spring on the back is in front.
However, the height adjustment lever is more natural to be positive, so many people will accidentally attach it.
There are no such basic precautions in the instruction manual, and it is assembled while trying and error while looking at the miscellaneous picture.
There is an error in the description of the contents The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who look for 8x20mm screws with 12pcs without being found.
The 8x20mm screw has already been inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for it in vain.
It seems that there is a combination that the work accuracy is low, and there seems to be a combination that can be inserted with the same screw hole and the combination that can not be inserted even with the same screw hole
In some combinations, it is very difficult to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with the screws inserted like this.
I also didn't see the spare screws in the instructions.
[Others] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring, and it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos because it is white in some places.
The explanation that the instruction manual is incomplete and the supplementary explanation of the above mounting method arrived at the email address registered on Amazon on the 2nd to 3rd from the arrival of the product.
These items should be released immediately after the shipment of the goods.
In the two to three days from the arrival of the product, many buyers have completed the assembly, so it is a completely meaningless act.
Hmm,
I am a big fan of thermos and have been using the thermos straw type for more than fifteen years, but this model is the most difficult to use.
1The drinking mouth part of the straw has become a harder material than ever, and the groove is addicted to the main body, and the drinking mouth part of the straw can not be taken at all from the main body!
! Claws are broken to try desperately to take.
Only the tip of the two-story mouth is thinner than before, and the straw brush is no longer inserted.
The mysterious valve at the end of the three straws is thicker than the straw brush, and it is dramatically difficult to wash.
I have not been dissatisfied with the use of straw type so far, so it is a bit of a shock.
Not being able to drink from the body is really stressful.
The good thing is that it is as good as ever.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and wash it the next day, I still have about fifty percent of the ice I put in the day before.
I don't drink Hot, so I'm a straw type person from now on.
Please improve the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(It is an impression of an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and lacks knowledge of wearing a doll eye for the first time)
When I attached it to Obitsudoru, it is very cute and light and I am very satisfied.
However, when wearing (entrance), you can not wear it unless you force it a little hard and press it in.
I think that the method is different, but I put a tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipment Since it was the first time to ship from overseas, I was looking at three weeks, but it arrived in eight days (Narita Airport is near) earlier than I expected.
However, I was worried because the sending email was never sent.
If you look at the Amazon shipping list earlier, it is still listed as being shipped.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and there were many petits on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it is safe for the time being.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is an e-mail flight from abroad?
I had a question, so I’ll give it a low one.
I think that this amount of goods is a very bargain at that price without any problems.
Postscript Doll Eye 8mm model iPhonese
A little small (the work area is small), the charge is terrible
I ordered the size notation after seeing it, but I felt that it was about two times smaller than I imagined.
Although it is larger than the A4 size, the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I thought that I would use it when repairing electronic devices and making gunpla, but it is difficult to use without B4 size.
It is used only for the work of solder, and other tasks such as assembly and disassembly may be managed if you use another tray or mat.
In the area of the magazine size, it is impossible to put the tool, place the parts, and do further work ....
I thought that I would order another thing and double the area, but during the work, the charge is so bad that it sucks up all the dust and cut parts, so I think it would be difficult to continue to use it for a while.
Deadly flaweds
I finally opened the lid using a rubber anti-slip sheet after the lid of the battery box did not open, but if I tried to load the battery and close it, it would not close anyway.
It's out at this point.
High rating!
Will the battery box cover close?
In addition, there was a small salan wrap on the buyobuyo instead of the protective seal of the product.
Could this be a secondhand item?
Speaking of explanations, only English words written on small pieces of paper.
There is no explanation of the illustration and the operation method is not familiar to everyone.
Maybe on another finger...
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately, I thought.
Because I use it for a pinkie ring, it does not fit well if I use it a lot, but it was not a little rough ...
I think it’s good to use it on other fingers.
I think it’s a good idea businessman.
In terms of price.
Don’t ask for quality for this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was destroyed.
The feeling of wearing it is just right the size.
People with thick ears may be tough.
Maybe I should have bought a no-brainer.
Yabana
The design is good, but if you put it on your hands, it will be big.
In the east of the harsh winter season ...
As others' reviews can see, the electric heat wire is only 110x80 net, and the arrangement is horizontal rather than vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the whole futon, so I bought it that it was more expensive than the laying type, but it was not bigger, but I couldn't help it because I couldn't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer.
It can only be used in combination with the N warm of Yutanpoto and Tori.
The quality of the blankets is out of the question.
it's well done, but...
Small and plenty of air.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it will be fine as shown in the photo.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will blow away with your own wind power, but if you put a handkerchief on it, there is no problem.
If you use it outside / familyless, you will not notice it even if it is "middle", but in the office, it is not noisy even if it is "small".
It is necessary to divide the meal when you go out to the last.
In addition, even if it is "small" for office use, the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for the scene where you sweat a lot on the go and run away to the family restaurant, "large" and cooling at once.
However, when you throw it into the bag, in rare cases, the power button is pressed and it may be left around without knowing it.
It is good to have a device such as letting the button slightly (falling it) or long press the weak of the first push.
In the heat of the heat, which is dangerous to life, it is an essential item, so it will be helpful if you make a better thing.
Multi-function light speaker
I use it as the weakest warm color and put it in my bedroom.
Better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the luminance and color with touch type.
The white color suits any room, and the color light changes with a gradient, so it is beautiful.
Also, if you touch it with your favorite color, it will stop with your favorite color, so you can shine according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, you can expect a long life.
In terms of sound quality, I think that it is a level that is satisfied enough for my ears as an amateur.
Also, the great part of this light is that it is multifunctional anyway.
・Large speakers are attached to the top.
Since you can pair it with a mobile phone, you can enjoy music wirelessly.
・If you pair it with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
・Also, since it supports MicroSD, it can be linked with a personal computer and play music as an mp3 player.
Involvement and piano practice
At the age of sixty-six, he started challenging DTM to prevent blurring.
Buy audio interface and main unit.
At first, I was in the middle, but I was addicted to playing the piano, and I was busy practicing every day.
I downloaded the sound source of the attached note, but the protection did not work, and at first I downloaded ASIO, but the free piano sound source sounded good, so I am using this for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel cheated by the look.
Is it a product that is out of place?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the office chair (bounceable armrest) made by Doshisha, which I used for 4-5 years, deteriorated and became battered, so I considered purchasing it with a chair with a bouncing armrest with non-synthetic leather.
I searched for a home center and a furniture store, but there was no suitable thing.
I am worried that I can not confirm the actual thing, but I will compromise on the appearance and price of the design and purchase this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is a spare of one screw.
[Caution] The included hex wrenches and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, the hexa-angle wrench did not know the adhesion of oil and the body was white, so I was impatient when the oil came on.
Completed in forty minutes.
Completed and product confirmed.
The jumping-up armrest is different on the left and right, the hardness of the raised and lowered is different, the left side is heavy for raising and lowering, the right is light, the use of the armrest is not good (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak in the fixed force and "click" and drips immediately with the sound.
The seat is non-renewable high-density urethane foam feels hard, and it is not comfortable to sit (Is it weak?
The backrest part of the competition mesh is harder than other company's mesh chairs, and if you wear it lightly, your back hurts.
Although it is a detailed thing, the height from the seat to the ground was not 550, but 530 (the height of the seat height is important for height is important) and the leg part supported by the caster is not made of steel, so the durability remains questionable.
The part of the mesh fabric is used with a separate cushion, and the part of the mesh fabric is used with a towelette because it seems that deterioration (damage) will come quickly.
186cm 80kg I felt that the fit of the back was good for me, but other than that, I think that it is a product with low satisfaction, and I feel that it is also a product with a hit.
After all, it may be better to sit down and buy an office chair with the actual thing.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer to say a purchase greeting, so why not contact us for armrests and headrests?
Under consideration.
Well, is it something like this?
I bought a 4K tuner of Pixera, which was cheap in price without much expectation, because it seems that BS4K of the right turn is likely to be seen in the environment of the house.
As an experiment, free broadcasts of NHK BS4K and other right turning can be seen, and at the same time you can enjoy it beautifully on Panasonic's 4K TV purchased.
(Sometimes the image is creaky) Immediately after purchase, the update came, and it became a recording support, so I made some reserved recordings and watched it, but I wonder if there is also the influence of the external 2.5inch HDD, it is a situation where only the image stops or the frame skips occur due to playback.
The user interface was also not praised, but "4K broadcasting can be seen".
By the way, it feels like you can only follow and play the recorded program during the reserved recording, and this area is also accepted as a positive function that can be recorded in 4K on HDD.
You may be disappointed if you buy a lot of things, so don’t expect too much.
We expect it to be improved with the update.
The heat-retaining function is OK.
I have only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles, it warmed up in about two hours and became hot in two and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of the compact car and used it, but the fan sound is concerned when idling stops, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell of chemicals that were still emitted by the fans, probably because it was still new, and I needed to open the windows regularly and ventilate them.
As stated in the review by another person, the burr on the part that passes through the shoulder strap is terrible, so it is necessary to fold the burr with a minus screwdriver etc.
Really fragile
It suddenly broke down two months ago.
I liked the keystrokes and the size, but it doesn't make sense to break it.
I use a PC all day for work to process video, but the volume will be one hundred percent.
Even if you put it down, it will return to one hundred percent in an instant.
The earphones are so painful that you can't use them, and it's a low-pitched volume to use a PC at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display is repeated on the computer screen and disappearing.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so if you do not turn off the keyboard one by one, you can not use the mouse freely.
Enter keys and backspace keys also no longer respond.
I do not recommend it at all, but if you are a thousand yen, you can try it.
If you are lucky, you can use it for six months.
This is a six-month warranty compared to a one-year to three-year guarantee even at the same price range.
The short warranty period speaks of the fragility.
The product is the best, the packaging is the worst.
The product is my favorite because it is different in color and I love it.
I would like to recommend it to those who are looking for a food stocker ! !
However, there was a gap in the large cardboard that rolled around, and there was no delivery slip in it, and the packaging was the worst.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
I would recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about strength, but for the time being.
When I replaced the lid, I bought it because the support was not allowed.
It plays a role in the sense of stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, it makes a disgusting sound "Mekimeki, (It seems to break)" if you are careful when opening and closing the lid.
You have to choose something that matches the thickness of the lid, so be careful when purchasing.
A cute back with a meat ball
I was looking for a bag as if I had a dog and went out, and I was attracted to the fashionable gray color bag and bought this.
It was a set-up ceremony, and it was surprisingly light when I took it, so it was not so heavy even if I had it.
The zipper also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as a catch.
It seems to be easy to move for a long time.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
You can see the design of the meat ball even if you fold it, and it is cute even if you put it on.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I bought it with a love at first sight in the appearance and price of the cheapness.
TSA Rock is a favorite of the past few years and there are several others, but it is convenient.
And as a master of missing keys and lost, number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I have the most important point in lightness, so it is good, but if you ask for strength and security, the fastener is a week and a week, so it is a cloth, so it will be pricked with a knife! If it is cut, it will break in an instant.
In addition, the combination of the fastener is sweet, so I want a way to overlap.
It is recommended to carry it on a plane if it is overseas.
I used it on a bullet train trip, but it was comfortable.
Choosing the size is difficult...
It is difficult to buy shoes because of the wideness.
Converse and buns are wearing 24cm.
The MRL996 is also 24cm.
At first, I thought it was tough, but it was fine when I got used to it.
This time, ML574 was certainly tough when my sister said that 24.5cm was tough and let me wear it.
The little finger felt.
That's why I bought 25cm.
When you open it, it’s big...
If you wear socks, it will be a little loose.
I was worried about whether to return it, but if it is hard to make it 24.5, it will be troublesome, so I will continue to put it in and wear it with 25 as it is.
I bought a team red, but it is very good with bright red!
There are many black and white monotone clothes, so if you wear this, it will be brighter!
165cm, men in their 40s
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if you are similar to the following specifications, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165cm Weight: 60kg Waist: 81cm Around the navel: 100cm Typical Metabo belly.
In the water, the rash guard will rise up, probably because the waist part is loose.
I'm swimming while correcting the raised part.
Especially if you are careful in the jacuzzi, the metabolic belly is in full view.
Also, if you walk while exercising violently up and down, you will still come up from below.
<Product making> The fabric is not too strong and thin, so there is no worry that the nipples will be transparent.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this making, but I think that it will be better if you buy a small one.
The gas was out, but...
Silver Colt25 was also leaking gas, there was a problem that part of the tank was missing when changing the valve, but if you use [Bus Bond Q] to seal the tank and repair grease up, you can hit it quickly, If you want to buy this Colt25, you can ask someone who can disassemble and assemble, or if you do not disassemble while taking a digital camera photo, so you can not recommend it to those who are not confident because you do not disassemble while taking a digital camera photo, but those who think that it can break may be fun.I applied silicone grease to small parts and assembled while fixing it with grease, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, remove the safetyie screw, remove the two screws of the left body, remove the two screws of the left body, and do not scratch the tip of the barrel so as not to damage the tip of the barrel so that it does not get damaged, so that it does not get out by pinching the front site and the inner barrel with pliers, so if you slowly remove the left side of the monaka structure, you can disassemble it, but if you slowly remove the left side of the left side, you can disassemble it, but do not blame people even if you fail at your own risk.
I thought 188yen was the quality.
You can use it when you need a quick turn and torque.
It is light, small, and above all, the simplicity that is not vanishent is good.
There is no rattling when attaching a bit, and I thought that it was an amazing cost if it was 188yen with this.
What about durability?
It may not be used very often, but I think it is good to put it in a tool box.
I bought it with the same seller, "1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release driver kurled bit holder 60/100/150 mm".
No problem, it was pretty good for the price.
The controller stops working.
The machine can not move and operate itself.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but as soon as a few minutes, it becomes a symptom that it can not be operated because it moves in a direction where it is not in the same direction as it is not able to operate.
It is better not to buy this product.
I warn you all.
It's a terrible commodity.
I would recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is reliable and has not been broken yet even if it is used for a long time.
It can also be used for PC games.
UPDATE After a month of return as a defective product, I was able to get a refund of the Amazon gift certificate, so I think that was good.
Does this increase the calculation power?
I think it is for children who understand the calculation.
Is it possible for a child to understand the calculation to some extent?
The problem is difficult to understand.
Also, when I give the tool to the master, I will slide the thing on the screen up with my finger, but I tried it myself, but it will not go smoothly no matter how many times I do it.
In short, it may be easy to slip for those who are accustomed to DS?
I don't really like the illustrations of the characters in the manga, or I think that there are also things that enter from the fun of the screen, such as the DS, but for some reason I can not be familiar with it.
The method of calculation is also a way of competing time, for example, how many questions to be answered correctly in a few minutes.
I understand the feeling of rushing in a hurry with an exam, but ... shouldn't you rush and calculate?
I don't like why the gong sounded when it's over.
Can you work hard to make it sound better?
I feel like I lost $200k of this money.
I know the price of this half.
Sorry, that’s why I’ve become two so-so.
I think Persona's song is good!
Persona number three is up to ED.
Five played along the way.
Persona4 is troconed at vita.
What you can do has not changed since the 4th of the previous work.
There is no story, it feels shorter than the previous one.
The song is so cool!
Just listening to it makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona III were the first HD, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Junpei looked handsome somehow (laughs) Persona5 is beautiful from the original, so there is no freshness ... If you think so, I feel that three is more profitable.
As a sound game, I felt that it was easier to play five than three.
Persona3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
The main colors are bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if you wear it with the background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think that even those who are not good at sound game can play it.
If you turn on the challenge function, the sound game may be a crunchy game.
The triple pack has a suntra, but it is not a matter of Omake, but it is a solid four-piece set, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this.
Something's a pity.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual thing is blue, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but for now I'm on hold Will I give up because the price is cheap?
Postscript After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller saying that I would exchange it for an apology and a new product.
The subsequent treatment was also quick.
I think that the response was very good in spite of the cheap product.
Four stars to support 追記 After that, I also bought gold.
I think the color is very beautiful as you can see in the photo.
But after all the buckle is not a double lock, the difference from the explanation photo is obvious.
I'm just sorry there.
The evening becomes very heavy.
I used the SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setting, I did not know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointed at the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (settings > mobile communication > data roaming from the options of communication) and I was able to do it well.
The manual attached to the product did not seem to have much to do with it ...?
However, the area around Gimpo Airport was in poor radio waves, so I was grasping 3G for a long time.
When I went out into the city, it was 4G.
In the evening and at night, the communication sometimes became very heavy, but now that I think about it, it may have reached the upper limit of up to hundreds of MB a day.
Better than I thought.
I used the Softbank Z4 for two years, sim-free and used it on Ymobile, and the Z4 got worse, so when I was looking for a second-hand Xperia, I found this phone that can use a new and sashifu mobile phone and bought it.
I was using a mobile Suica, so I was worried about whether I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so I got the impression that it was an iPhone6?
Since I do not do GAME, the processing speed is the same as Z4, and the impression is that it is a little fast It is a review, and the fingerprint recognition is slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so the face recognition is faster, so I use it here.
I thought it was amazing like an iPhone I made it to Ver9 on Android, and I was able to make a satisfying purchase.
What I was worried about is a little smaller, no strap hole, no strap hole. * Compatible with a case with a strap hole I haven't experimented with water resistance I'm a little heavy I'm still a little bit, but I'm satisfied.
