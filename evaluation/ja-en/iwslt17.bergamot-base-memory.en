This is about how we get the knowledge.
The main character in the story is this woman, Natalia Liptinsky.
He's a paleontologist, and he's a specialist in digging for ancient corpses.
Natalia Lipchinsky: I used to call people "Dr. Dead".
Latif Nassah: I found it particularly interesting because the excavation site was far north of the Arctic Circle, in the tundra area of Canada.
One summer day, she was at the excavation site called the Files Leaf Bed, which has no latitude of ten degrees to the magnetic North Pole.
Natalia: You might think it's boring, because you're just carrying your backpack, holding your GPS and your notebook, picking up something that looks like a fossil, and walking around all day.
Latif: One day she noticed something.
Natalia: Old reddish-brown, palm-sized one
he was falling to the ground.
Latif: At first, I thought it was just a piece of wood, because in the files leaf bed, we found a lot of fragments of ancient plants.
but that night, i went back to camp
Natalia: Take out the loupe, and if you look a little closer, there's no ring.
It may be because of the state of preservation, but the more you look at it, the more you look
It was bone.
Latif: And over four years later, she visited this point many times, and eventually collected thirty pieces of the same bone, mostly very small.
Natalia: No number, it's enough to fit in a small plastic bag.
Latif: Like a puzzle, I tried to combine pieces.
it was a really hard job.
Natalia: It was cracked and shattered, so I tried to use sand and putty, but it didn't work.
So I ended up using a 3D scanner.
Latif: That's amazing! Natalia: Right?
Latif: It's much easier to work on the screen.
Natalia: I was a little impressed when we all combined.
Latif: How much confidence did you have that the assembly was the right one?
Is there a possibility that it will be different if you build it in a different way?
Natalia: No, no. I'm sure.
Latif: What she discovered was a bone, a leg, and an even shoe, a group of cows and sheep.
But this bone was not supposed to be a cow or a sheep.
it was too big.
Natalia: It was an extra-large size. It's a very large animal.
Latif: What kind of animal was it?
When she got stuck, she showed one of her bone fragments to her Colorado colleagues, and she was inspired by it.
Natalia: When we cut the ends of the bones with a saw, we smelled something distinctive.
Latif: Smells like burnt meat
It was the same smell that Natalia smelled when she cut her skull in an eerie autopsy room.
Collagen plays a role in keeping the structure of the bone.
as the years go by, it usually breaks down
In this case, the Arctic climate was preserved as a natural refrigerator.
A year or two later, when Natalia joined the conference in Bristol, a fellow scholar named Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new treatment method called collagen appraisal.
Each animal has a slightly different collagen structure, and if they know the characteristics of collagen in an unknown bone, they can compare them with the animals they already know, and maybe they can be identified.
that's why i sent you one piece of bone.
Natalia: I wanted to track it because it was important.
Latif: He processed bone fragments, compared to thirty-seven modern mammals.
and we found a matching animal.
Natalia excavated in the high-latitude Arctic, and the owner of the bones three and a half million years ago was
It was a camel.
Natalia: "Huh?" and I thought, "Well, if that's true, that's amazing.
Latif: We tested a lot of bone fragments, and they all had the same results.
But from the size of the bones we found, this camel was thirty percent larger than it is today.
He was about 2.7m tall, and he weighed about one tonne.
that's right.
Natalia discovered the giant polar camel.
When you think of camels, you think of camels, which live in the East and Central Asia.
The picture in your head is probably this human camel, and this is a desert creature, and you live in a hot desert like the Middle East and the Sahara Desert, and you're living in the Middle East, in the slums of the back, you save water for a long journey in the desert, and you're going to be on a wide scale, and you're going to be on a wide scale of sand.
Why did such an animal reach the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
In fact, scientists have known this before, before Natalia's discovery, and in fact, the camel's origin is in the United States.
and that's where it was born.
It's been about forty-five million years since the camels appeared, and for almost forty million years, they've been distributed only in North America, and there's been about twenty or more of them.
Latif: Did you know the difference when you put them all together?
Natalia: Yeah, the size of the body is different.
There was a very long neck, and it was like the neck of a giraffe.
Latif: There were some that looked like crocodiles.
Natalia: Early primordial camels were very small, about the size of rabbits.
Latif: What? Is it a rabbit-sized camel?
Natalia: It's an early kind.
you can't see it.
Latif: I'd like to have a rabbit camel.
Natalia: Yeah, it's the best.
Latif: And then, 3 to 7 million years ago, a herd of camels went down to South America, and then it became a llamas and an alpaca, and another kind of people went to Asia and Africa by crossing the Beering Rand Bridge.
At the end of the last ice age, the camels of North America went extinct.
So far, we've already found it, but it's not entirely possible to fully explain what it's found in the north.
For example, in terms of temperature, it's the opposite of the Sahara Desert.
It's true that the temperature three and a half million years ago was an average of twenty-two degrees higher than it is today.
So there's a coniferous forest that might have been similar to the current Yukon River basin and Siberia.
But even so, the winter lasted for six months, and the pond would have frozen.
there's a blizzard.
There must have been a time when the darkness of the night would last for twenty-four hours.
So, the whole thing.
How could this Sahara superstar survive the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her fellow scholars think they've found the answer.
and it's a great answer.
What if the camels we've been thinking about in order to adapt to places like the Sahara Desert are actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the wide legs were not for walking on the sand, but for walking on the snow like kanjiki?
I was surprised that I didn't know it was on my back, but it was stuffed with fat, not water, and what if that fist helped us survive a six-month-long winter with little food?
What if, after a while, after crossing the overpass, the winter-oriented feature was used for the hot desert environment?
For example, a hump might be useful in a hot climate, because if you store all of your body fat in one place, like a backpack, you don't have to cover your body with fat that plays a role in the insulation.
That would make it easier to get rid of the heat.
What was considered a representative proof of this tremendous idea of adapting to the desert could actually be evidence of once living in the high-latitude Arctic.
this is not the first time i've ever told this story.
Others have been telling the story about the wonders of evolutionary biology, and using it as a clue to unraveling future climate change.
But that's another reason why I like this story.
For me, this is about myself, and it's about our worldview, and how it changes.
I've been educated as a historian.
And what we've come to understand is that scientists are mostly historians.
They also try to understand the past.
It tells the history of the universe, the planet, the life of the Earth.
And as a historian, we start by thinking about the development of the story.
Natalia: We make stories, we stick to it, like the story of a camel in the desert.
It's a very well-made story, and the camels are perfectly adapted.
i've always been in the desert.
Latif: But one day we might find some little bit of evidence.
By understanding the little things, you might be reassembling everything you believed in.
In this case, too, yes, a piece of wood-like fossils discovered by a scientist, and that's the way it's coming up in a picture book by Dr. Sousse, and that's why this animal looks like this, and that's a whole new hypothesis that goes beyond common sense.
My way of thinking about camels has changed.
From the very specific view of an animal that can only be adapted to a specific environment, desert, to a very specific view of being in the Sahara Desert, we have changed the way we think of the world as an animal that can live anywhere.
(Applause) This is Azzuri.
Hey, Azuli, hello.
Hey, eat.
Azzuri usually performs at Radio City Music Hall.
i'm not kidding.
Now, this Azuri is the living proof that the story about our world is dynamic.
We have to re-assemble the story and re-imagine it.
Isn't that right, Azuri?
There's a new way of looking at the world on the other side of a piece of bone.
thank you.
Modern computers are so good that we don't even realize how bad it is.
Today, I want to talk about this problem, and this, in neuroscience, about "repairing."
The night of the frost in Harlem, that night, it had a deep shock to me.
It was a time when I was studying computer science and neuroscience, and it was a time when I was talking meaningfully with a friend at a bar outside Columbia University about the power of holograms that would one day replace computers.
And when our conversation was at its peak, his phone shone.
And he took out his phone, and he started looking at it, and he started typing it.
And when he looked up at me with only his eyes, he said, "Go ahead and listen."
But of course, his gaze was blurred, and the meaning of that time was lost.
And then, on the other side of the bar, another student has a smartphone, and he raises it up to a group of friends.
They were swiping on Instagram photos, and they were laughing.
I started to think about how I was happy about the same technology, even though I was dissatisfied with it.
And as I thought about it, I realized that the bad guys weren't the digital information themselves, they were just separating me from my friends, and on the other hand, they connected.
They were connected around something, and I think that's why I'm here, like my ancestors, who told stories around a bonfire and developed social cognition.
should be an extension of the body's functions.
On today's computers, the opposite is happening.
When you're sending an email to your wife, when you're composing a symphony, or when you're comforting your friends, you're acting exactly the same.
I'm succumbing to this square, and I'm working with the endless icons and menu buttons.
I think this is wrong, and I think we can start using natural machines all the more.
We need to use a machine that pulls these things back into the real world.
By applying the principles of neuroscience, we should use machines that extend rather than limit perception.
now, i brought you a machine like that.
This is Meta 2.
Let's try it.
Now I can see you in front of me, and I can see my hands.
So let's get into the immersive hologram experience, 3, 2, and 1, where a very realistic hologram emerges in front of me, right in front of my headset.
Of course, what you're looking at can be a product that you're shopping for, or it could be a learning material, and you can use your hands to precisely control it, and you can move it well.
Iron Man will be proud of you.
I'm going to show you this again soon.
(Applause) If you think the same way, you're excited to think about what you can do with this technology, and you're excited about that.
My mother is an architect, so naturally I came up with the idea of drawing a three-dimensional design in a three-dimensional space instead of a two-dimensional drawing.
My mother is now touching the footage and choosing the interior of the interior.
All of this was shot through the headgear using a GoPro camera.
The next example is very personal: the Glass Brain project, which is courtesy of Professor Adam Gassary at the University of California, San Francisco.
As a neuroscience student, I've always dreamed of learning and learning with a machine that can touch and manipulate this diverse, complex brain structure.
What we're looking at now is augmented reality, but it's part of a more important idea: a vision that we're going to expand instead of restricting physical capacity with digital devices.
now...
I think in the next few years, we're going to have a turning point.
All kinds of digital information are beginning to be represented in the real world.
Imagine a little bit, and what does this mean for the storyteller, the painter, the brain surgeon, the interior designer, and the people who are here?
As a social community, we need to imagine how we can create a new reality that can extend the human experience, and we can just try not to make reality a game or to be messy with digital information.
I'm very passionate about this.
now, i'm going to tell you a little bit
Within about five years, this is not a small device, but within about five years, all of these will be like thin glasses that project holograms.
When we choose a smartphone, we don't care much about the hardware itself, and we focus on basic software, but as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of creating "the iOS of the mind."
It's very important to make it properly, because we might spend at least as long as the interface of the windows screen with these systems.
I don't know if you guys are crazy, but living in Windows is a coy.
In order to derive the most intuitive interface out of all possibilities, we have focused on neuroscience, and instead of letting designers engage in discussions in boardrooms.
And the principle that we put at the center of this is the least number of resistance neural pathways.
It's constantly connecting the iOS of the mind to the human brain, and for the first time, the human brain controls it.
In other words, we're trying to build a computer that doesn't need to be learned how to use it
We're building a system that allows users to understand how to use it naturally.
Here are three of the main new design guidelines for the user experience we used.
The most important thing is that the person who uses it is the OS.
A system made up of traditional files is complex, abstract, and even to understand it, we use our heads first.
It's doing the opposite of the least resistance nerve pathway.
But in augmented reality, you put a hologram TED panel here, and you put a hologram email on the other side of the desk, and your spatial memory adapts to this, and you can reach out and retrieve information.
From the Tesla car you want to buy, to the legal team, you can display anything in a hologram, from what you asked of me in advance.
Okay, now your brain has learned how to extract information.
The second guiding principle of the interface is "to see, to touch."
When you see something your baby is interested in, what do you do first?
You try to reach out your hand and touch it.
This is how natural machines should work.
The visual system receives basic stimuli from the sense of prophyparticity, which is a sensation that occurs deep in the body.
So by touching the work directly, you can not only better control it, but also better understand it.
That's why we're going to look, touch, took.
But that's not enough as an experience.
Humans are primates, which are naturally social creatures.
And then there's the third guideline, the hologram version of the first example of a bonfire.
The primate mirror neuron subsystem shows that if we can look at each other's faces and hands in three dimensions, we can work better together, we can work together.
Watch the video behind me, where two Meta users are dealing with the same hologram, and they're connecting through this object, looking at each other without being distracted by their devices.
Now, with neuroscience in mind, let's try this again.
It is our favorite "heart iOS"
Let's go one step further, and we'll pick up this headset, and put it in this place next to the desk.
I'm with you now, and at this moment we're connected.
When my spatial memory works, and I grab my headset and I get it back, I realize that I'm the operating system.
And my sense of intrinsicivity works, and I break this headset down into thousands of parts, and I touch the sensors that scan my hands.
But it's not enough to see this on your own, so now the co-founder, Ray, will make a 3D call soon.
(Calling) やあ レイ How are you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I see him in three dimensions in front of me.
with a realness like the one in the picture
(Applause) Thank you.
My mirror neuron system suggests that this is going to replace a mobile phone soon.
ray, how are you doing?
all right, i'm having a live conversation right now.
(Applause) Ray, I'm going to show you the hologram brain that I just saw in the video.
Ladies and gentlemen, this will not only change the phone, but it will also change the way we work together.
thank you.
Ray, thank you.
you're welcome.
(Applause) This is the message I found in that bar last year, and the future of computers is not stuck on a flat screen.
here, it's in us.
(Applause) If we were to choose one idea today and leave it to you, the natural machine is not the creation of the future, but that it's already here.
So all of the staff at Meta — administrative staff, executives, designers, engineers — will be throwing out the monitor screen by TED2017, using a truly natural machine.
thank you.
(Applause) Thank you.
thank you.
Chris Anderson: I'd like to ask you, because there's been a number of augmented reality demos over the last few years.
There's a lot of debate among engineers about whether they're looking at the real thing on the big screen.
There was also some points that when you wear an actual headset, you can draw a broader field of view in a demo than you can see.
what you showed me was the actual video.
of course. it's real.
Not only that, but when I made the video that I introduced, I did a lot of work, and I shot it through the lens of the GoPro camera.
Because I wanted you to have a whole, simulated experience of the real experience that you see through your headgear.
Thanks for introducing me.
thank you.
My birthplace is Seattle, Washington, the most free, tolerant, progressive place in the United States.
I grew up in a wonderful Seattle kid family.
My mother is an artist, and my father is a university professor, and I am very grateful for the environment in which I grew up, because I've always been able to decide my own way of life as I want.
I didn't really follow the path my parents had imagined.
It doesn't matter if you drop out of college or drop out of college when you're nineteen.
And as a professional horn player, I started to tour all over the place, and that was what I've always dreamed of.
I was playing chamber music, and I was traveling all over the United States, around Europe, and for many years I worked with Charlie Bird, a great jazz guitar player.
And by the end of my twenties, I was part of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a good life.
My parents never complained.
They supported me all the time.
it wasn't their ideal.
He said to his neighbors and friends, "My son's in the middle of a gap year — about ten years."
But I've only had one awkward conversation about my way of life, so I'm going to talk about it.
I was twenty-seven years old, and I was on my way home from Barcelona, and I was home on my Christmas vacation, and I was cooking with my mother in the kitchen, and we were alone.
My mother is silent and she is too silent.
I thought something was wrong.
Mom, what are you thinking?
My mother said, "We're very worried about you."
"What do you mean?" I thought, "What's the matter?"
“To be honest with me, you didn’t vote for the Republican Party, did you?”
Now, the truth is, I was just a horn player who wasn't so interested in politics.
I realized it a little bit, and my parents were a little confused.
I'm a passionate supporter of capitalism, and I'm going to tell you how that happened.
It's because of something that I've always been interested in, and it's not surprising, but it's poverty.
I remember the first time I saw real poverty in Seattle.
My family was low- and middle class, but of course it wasn't real poverty.
it was far away.
The first time I saw poverty and poverty was in the early 70s, when I was six or seven years old.
It was like you've all experienced something, it's been a common experience.
It's a picture of me in National Geographic, and it's about my age in East Africa, and there were flies on my face, and my stomach was expanding.
It was clear that I couldn't help it anymore, but I couldn't do anything.
Some of you may remember the photo, not the same picture, but the same thing.
It's a picture that showed Western countries the poverty that continues to afflict the world.
And that picture caught my eye, and I couldn't forget it, even if I grew up, I went to school, I dropped out, I had a new school, I had a family.
I wondered what happened to her.
I wonder what happened to people like that all over the world.
So I started looking, and I wasn't in college at the time, but I was looking for answers, and I was looking for answers, and I was looking for answers, and I was wondering what happened to the people who were
Did it get worse, or did it get better?
And I'm going to find the answer, and I'm going to tell you all about it, and it's
Now, most Americans think that poverty has gotten worse, and I think it's worse than when I was a kid, and I think it was worse than when I was a kid.
If you ask Americans if the world's poverty has worsened or improved, 70 percent will say that hunger has worsened since the early 70s.
So let me tell you the truth.
This is the enlightenment that changed my worldview.
Between the 1970s and the present day, people living in the world's population in a state of hunger — people who live on less than a dollar a day — naturally, by adjusting the inflation rate — and so on, the proportion of those people has fallen by 80 percent.
Eighty percent less poverty in the world than when I was a child.
i didn't even know that.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a miracle.
it's something to be happy about.
It's the greatest anti-poverty feat in human history, and that's what happened in our generation.
(Applause) When I found out about this, I had a question about what I had achieved.
If you don't know why you can do it, you can't recreate it.
If we want to replicate this, and if we want to lift another two billion people out of poverty, that's the main thing — from my childhood to now, our brothers and sisters, two billion of our brothers and sisters, who are the little ones in the Bible, are getting out of poverty.
I want to know how to save two billion more people.
So I started looking for answers.
Politics had nothing to do with the answer. I didn't care.
I'm not interested.
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists, right, left, centrist, regardless.
let me tell you the answer.
There are five success factors.
To this day, we, our brothers and sisters, two billion people in the world, have been lifted out of poverty.
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
The third is property rights.
The fourth is the rule of law.
The fifth is business.
Since the 1970s, the world has become a free enterprise system, and since the 1970s, the whole world has become a free enterprise system.
But I'm not simple.
We know that free enterprise is not perfect, and we know that there are things that we need outside of free enterprise to build a better world.
but it's amazing.
It's beyond politics.
what i learned, what i realized
The significance of capitalism is not limited to the accumulation of wealth.
The best side of capitalism is that we have aspirations, and a lot of people talk about their aspirations on this stage, because they're deeply connected to the free enterprise system.
We need to spread this ambition even further.
Now, let's talk about the second enlightenment, which is related to the first enlightenment, and it's going to bring progress not only around the world, but also in the city we live in, not just in the world, but in the city we are in today.
One of the best things I've ever heard about the idea of poverty relief, which I've just talked about, is that there's no more system in human history than the free market.
because we've lifted billions out of poverty.
Whose words?
Sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
no, no, no.
President Barack Obama.
why can't you say that?
because they told me directly.
you can't believe it.
And what came out of my mouth was "Banzai!"
And I thought, "What a great opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
May 2015In the middle of the event about this theme, at Georgetown University.
I thought that's the solution to the biggest problem that America is facing.
It's about reaching out to the people who need us most, regardless of whether they're liberals or conservatives, under the idea that the free market will solve poverty.
You probably don't say that the crisis is happening in the U.S. and around the world because of the polarization of politics.
now, we're in a crisis.
it's an unpleasant situation. this shouldn't be the case.
Last year, a paper was published in the Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences, a science journal with the highest authority in the West, and one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the West.
In this year's paper, the theme was "politically motivated asymmetry."
In some ways, psychologists define that their own ideology is born of love, but the enemy's worldview is based on hatred.
It's often the case in the world of conflict.
For example, the phenomenon that can be seen between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this paper have discovered is that in today's America, the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats are falling into the idea of a "politically motivated asymmetry."
The vast majority of people in America today who are passionate about politics believe that they are moving with love, and they are driven by hate.
think about it.
Most people think, "My ideology is based on very basic tolerance, and I want to help people, but the others are the bad guys who are trying to trick me into."
As long as we have these kinds of asymmetry, we can't move forward as a society.
it's impossible.
So what's the solution?
First of all, let's be honest, there's a difference, and it's natural.
It's not that simple, so as not to underestimate the differences.
there's a lot of good research on this.
veteran ted speaker and friend Jonathan Heitt
i'm a professor of psychology at new york university
We study the differences in the ideologies, their values, their different morals.
He said, conservatives and liberals, for example, have a very different level of importance.
For example, according to Heit, 59% of liberals care about poverty than those who value economic freedom.
Among conservatives, people who value economic freedom are 28 percent more likely to care about poverty than they do.
this gap doesn't seem to be shrinking.
you're never incompatible? you're wrong.
This is diversity, and that's where our strength lies.
Do you remember what saved the poor?
The obsession with poverty spread around the world by means of a free economy.
So if we need each other, we want to lift the next two billion people out of poverty, if we want to help people.
there's no other way.
now,
How can we achieve this?
it's difficult.
We need innovative thinking.
there's a lot of them on this stage.
Social entrepreneurship - that's true. It's definitely the best.
It requires sustainable, ethical, moral, and responsible foreign investment.
that's absolutely right! but what do you really need?
It's a new world with flexible ideologies.
We need more surprises.
Isn't that right?
Have you ever felt that your ideology has become more type-type?
Is it something that's normal?
Do you think you're just listening to people with the same opinion as you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, there's a conservative on the right, and we're talking about taxes, regulations, big governments.
There's a liberal on the left, and when we talk about the economy, it's always about income inequality.
Both are important, both for me and for you.
When we talk about hunger today, when we talk about saving people who are suffering from hunger and needing help from poverty, this gets in the way.
We need to work together in the best way in our free use, in the best way to alleviate poverty, when we can, for conservatives, liberals, and their obsession with poverty, and liberals, when they need to be both conservatives and their obsession with the free market.
This diversity, if we just accept it, will be one of America's strengths in the future.
So how can we do this together?
I need a list of activity items, not just for you, but for myself.
The first one is, and keep in mind that it's not enough to accept people with different opinions.
that's not enough.
It's important to keep in mind that we need people who don't agree with us, because there are people who are still waiting for these tools that we can provide through our diversity.
now, what should we do?
where does it start? here.
We're all in this room. We're blessed.
We're blessed with people who listen.
We're blessed with success and leadership.
If you talk about an unthinkable ideology, they might listen to you.
maybe that's where the progress starts.
That's the first one, and that's the second one.
I want you to be, and I want to be the kind of person I want to be, especially someone who can change the boundaries to something ambiguous, and I want you to be a person who is difficult to mold.
Conservatives always talk about poverty, like conservatives who talk about their moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you're a liberal, you're always talking about the goodness of the free market when you're responsible and using it responsibly to solve our problems.
And then there are two things that happen.
The first is that we can start the next two billion rescues, and we can work on solutions that we need in the future, as we've seen a lot in the past.
Second, we can turn the terrible and sacred ideological battles we're going through in this country into a competition for ideas based on a sense of solidarity and respect for each other, a competition for ideas based on a sense of solidarity and mutual respect.
And then you'll realize that maybe the big difference we think we're going to be is not that big.
thank you.
I was a political major in college, so I had to write a lot of reports.
If a normal student writes a report, the amount of work is distributed like this.
This is, at first, slowly, but in the first week, we're going to go well, and in the second half, when the load is a little higher, it's still in an orderly state.
i want to do that, too.
as planned
I'm going to start right away, but when I actually do a report, it's like this in my case.
it's like this every time.
And then I decided to write a ninety-page thesis, and that's what I'm going to write for a year.
I knew that the way things used to be don't work.
it's too large.
So I made a plan, and I decided to do it this way.
it's a one-year plan.
It's like a gentle staircase, which is a little bit up in the middle at the beginning, and spurts at the end.
Going up these stairs.
it's not going to be difficult.
But something strange happened.
the first few months
It came over, but I couldn't do anything.
So the plan changes that.
And then, the middle period went by, but I couldn't write, and that's what I'm going to do.
Two more months is a month, and that's two more weeks.
One morning, I woke up, and I only had three days until the deadline, and I didn't have a choice but to write a few words, and I had no choice but to write a ninety-eight-page paper in seventy-two hours, and I stayed up all night, two nights in a row, and the human body didn't do that, but I did my best to run through the campus, and time turned into slow motion, and I submitted it at the moment of the deadline.
I thought it was all over.
I got a call a week later, from college.
“Is that Tim Urban?”
yes.
i have a story about the paper that was submitted.
"Ahhhhhhhhhh
And he said, "I've never seen such a great graduation thesis."
Oh my God, it didn't happen.
It was a terrible paper.
I just wanted to make people think, "Isn't this guy a genius?"
it's a terrible paper.
I'm a writer now.
I have a blog called Wait But Why.
About two years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always puzzled people around me, and what's going on in the procrastinationist's head and why we do that?
I wanted to explain it to people who aren't procrastinators, and I thought there would be a difference between the prostracitor's brain and the brain of the non-procrasting straper.
To make sure of that, I decided to find a place where I could get an MRI of my brain and a certain person's brain that I wasn't a procrastinationist, and I decided to compare it.
and i'm bringing the results here today.
I'd like you to be careful if you can see the difference.
It's a difficult difference if you're not a brain expert, but anyway, look at it.
This is the brain of a person who is not a procrastinationist.
[Rational decision-makers] In this regard
it's my brain.
[Salt, who wants a reward right away] This is the difference between the two.
In both brains, there are rational decision-makers, but in the case of procrastinationists, there are monkeys that want a reward right away.
How does that relate to procrastination?
Everything's going well, until this happens.
"I'd better do a little bit of work," and the rational decision-makers made a rational decision to do something productive, but the monkeys didn't like it, so they took the rund and said, "Yeah, I'm going to read a Wikipedia article about the case of Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, and I remember that.
And then you have to go check the refrigerator and see if there's anything that's changed for ten minutes.
And then there's the YouTube spiral, and Richard Feynman starts with a video about magnets, and then I watch an interview with Justin Bieber's mom.
and for the time being, i'm sorry, but today is already
i can't afford to put in a job.
What's going on?
I want the monkeys to steer, not the other party.
I live only in the present moment.
I don't have any memories of the past, I don't know anything about the future, and I only care about two things: easy and fun.
In the animal world, that's no problem.
If you're a dog, it's a great way to be successful to spend a lot of time just doing things that are much easier and more fun.
For monkeys, humans are just a kind of animal.
You can only eat well, sleep well, create the next generation, and you could have done that when you were living a primitive life, that might have been good.
We're not living a primitive life now.
We're in a more advanced civilized society, but the monkeys don't know what it is.
That's why there's another rational decision-maker in the brain that gives us abilities that other animals don't have.
We imagine the future.
You can see the big picture.
and we're going to have a long-term plan.
The rational decision-making person takes everything into account.
I'm trying to get them to do what they have to do.
Sometimes it makes sense to do something easy and fun, like dinner, when you sleep, when you're in your spare time.
there's a overlap between the two.
and we have a lot of opinions.
But as a big decision, it makes sense to do things that are difficult and not very fun.
and that's when there's a conflict.
If you're a procrastinator, this conflict always tends to end with a certain result, and you're going to spend a lot of time in the orange part, and it's easy and fun, and it doesn't make sense to do it.
I call this area the Dark Playground.
The dark playground is a place where procrastinators know well.
It's a place where you can play when you're not playing.
The fun in the dark playground isn't really fun, it's full of fun, guilt, fear, anxiety, self-hatred, and the familiar sense of procrastination.
The question is, in a situation where the monkeys are at the rudder, how the procrastination is the blue area, the less comfortable, but the really important thing is to move to where it happens.
In fact, there's a procrastination guy who always watches over me, and he's called the worst, or it's called a panic monster.
Panic Monsters are mostly asleep, but they're about to wake up suddenly, when they're about to wake up, when they're about to lose their face, when they're about to get into a terrible, professional crisis, and so on.
What's important is that it's the only thing that monkeys are afraid of.
Most recently, I was indebted to him, and six months ago, people at TED contacted me and asked me to give them a TED talk.
And of course, I said, "I'll do it."
It's been a dream of mine for years to be able to say, "I've done TED talk before."
[Ted talks] In the midst of this excitement, rational decision-makers care about something else.
"Do you know what you accepted?
Do you know what's going to happen in the future?
I have to sit down and take it off right now!”
The monkey replies, "I totally agree, but I'm going to open Google Earth, and I'm going to open up the bottom of India to 60m above the ground, scroll for two and a half hours, and I'm going to go up to the top end, and I'm going to get a good picture of India."
And that's what I was doing all day.
Six months is four months, two months, one month, TED has published a list of speakers.
When I opened that page, I saw my own face.
So who's woken up?
Panic Monster became frantic, and soon the whole system was in chaos.
Remember that monkeys are afraid of panic monsters, and they run away on the tree.
Now that the rational decision-makers are at the helm, I'm ready for the talk.
Panic Monsters can explain the crazy behavior of the procrastinator, and it takes two weeks to not write a single line of the report, which is a miracle, a powerful work ethic, and then write eight pages through the night.
This is the whole situation with three characters, the procrastinator system.
It's not pretty, but it works eventually.
This is what I decided to write on my blog two years ago.
And when I wrote it, I was surprised by the reaction to the blog.
And we've got literally thousands of emails from all over the world, from a lot of different people.
Nurse, banker, painter, engineer, and so many graduate students.
And they were all writing, and they were saying, "I have the same problem."
But the lightness of the blog post and the weight of the emails we received were in stark contrast.
It was written with a strong frustration at the impact of procrastination on their lives, and I wondered what kind of situation the monkey was doing because of the monkeys.
And I thought, I'm going to see what happens to the procrastinator system that works.
Why are they in such a dark state?
And what we found is that there are two kinds of procrastination.
In the example I talked about, there was a deadline.
When there's a deadline, the effects of procrastination are limited to a short period of time, and panic monsters appear.
But there's another kind of procrastination, and there's no deadline.
In the case of entrepreneurial work, like a businessman or an artist, there's no deadline at the beginning, because nothing happens until you go out and do something and get on track and run.
And there's a lot of things that don't have deadlines outside of work, whether you're going to see your family, exercising, maintaining your health, or building relationships that don't work.
If the procrastination is only a panic monster, the mechanism for doing these difficult things is that in a situation where there is no deadline, panic monsters don't appear.
There's nothing to wake up to do, and the effects of procrastination are not limited, and they're going to keep procrastinating forever.
This kind of long-term procrastination is more difficult to see and spoken than a ridiculous, short-term, short-term, short-term procrastination, usually because it's quiet and frustrating.
Long-term, great misfortune and regret.
It could be a source, and I thought that was the reason they wrote the emails, and that's why they were in such a terrible situation.
It's not that it's canned in some project.
Long-term procrastination makes you feel like a bystander in your life.
Their frustration is not that they can't make their dreams come true, but that they can't even start chasing them.
I've been reading these emails, and I've been inspired by that there's no one who's not procrastinated.
they're all procrastinators.
You may have a healthy relationship with the deadline, even if it's not a mess like me, but be careful that the most disgusting thing about monkeys is when there is no deadline.
And one last thing I want to show you is.
it's a life calendar.
Each box is equal to each week of ninety years of life.
It's not that much, because we're already using it a lot.
I think we should all take a closer look at this calendar.
Because what you're really procrastinating is that everyone should be procrastinating something.
You need to be aware of the monkeys that you want to reward right away.
This is my job for all of us.
Given that there aren't that many boxes, we should start this job today.
well, if not right today.
if you can.
Not too far away.
thank you.
And then I was waiting in a church in Texas that was filled with my soul and body, scared to the last moment of my life.
Just in this place, there was a slewd chair of a broken tree, a red rag, and there was a choir sitting on the left, and there was a choir in the back, and there was a baptist tub in the back.
it's no different.
The tension that goes away, the desperate wish for salvation, the sweating palm, and the back, who seems to be very uninteresting.
On the night of the second coming of Christ, when I believed that the world would end.
That year, I was just twelve years old, and I was officially recognized as a full-fledged person in the Holy Scriptures.
And yet, I'm sorry that it's unfair to think that the world is going to end, but it's a later festival, and I've had to rethink what's going to happen.
Change your mind, go to church as much as you can.
I prayed so seriously that I forgot the passage of time, and God looked at my disbelief, and it was already desperate to make my coming earlier than planned.
And then I just kept in mind, "Please save me." I was reading books that were popular at the time.
I found it in a sentence, and at the time of destiny, if one person lacks faith, more tragedies await.
The task that has been assigned to me is to control all my desires, to overcome the devil and the inertia, to overcome my own non-belief.
Let's believe that twelve-year-olds can do it.
And now that time is fast approaching.
23h50
The remaining ten minutes, the pastor gathered us in front of the altar to receive a time when the clock pointed to the time of destiny, with a deep prayer.
People from all denominations come together.
The choirs stay in their seats, butlers and their wives, and the bourgeois church members, in the front row of the altar, are in position.
As you know, in the United States, even the second coming of Christ has a VIP seat.
(Applause) Right behind that VIP is the elderly people, who are young people who have continued to work in the slimmering sun of East Texas, working in a cotton field, and they're young, and the skin that was burned in the sun, and that skin without wrinkles is like the earth itself, and people who have been betrayed by that expectation many times, with dreams of living a different life.
They are the protagonists for me.
They've been giving their whole life to this moment, and as our predecessors in the Middle Ages were waiting for the coming of the last days, they were making the talk show, which starts every day at four o'clock, a way to live.
Like my grandmother, my grandmother, she's going to be in front of the altar, and I've sneaked her back, and I'm sure she's going to heaven.
I was thinking about whether I could go to heaven together if I held her hand during the prayer.
I'm going to hold your hand, I'm going to close my eyes, I'm listening, I'm praying.
The pastor’s voice was loud.
Prayers that respond to it become a cry and reverberate through the church.
The melody of the keyboard increases its momentum
And the heat that goes with it surrounds the church.
i'm going to re-hand my grandmother's hand once again, so that she doesn't go.
In the face of the horror of fate, I ran into the darkness behind my eyelids.
And then that voice goes down, "Amen."
it's over.
The clock's hands.
it's already past its fateful time.
The savior didn't show up, and I looked at them, and I couldn't even realize the new possibilities because I closed my eyes so deeply and too long that I couldn't help but feel disappointed.
I was heartbroken by their appearance.
They were deceived, they were the victims of the deception, and I was one of them.
I've been praying, trying not to give in to temptation.
I've been baptized twice, not once, but twice, and I believed in that trial.
Until then, sure.
When I went home and turned on the TV, Peter Jennings celebrated the very beginning of the new century, and the news was circulating all over the world.
There's a strange idea that comes to mind at that time, and I wonder if God will descend many times while worrying about the time difference.
This flash was so ridiculous, and it was brutal.
But I didn't stop believing.
And we have a new faith, and we have a new faith, and that the answer is not one.
My answer was wrong, and the problem itself was wrong, and that's the belief that confronts that absurdity.
A new sunlight is coming into the frozen, motionless winter mountain of faith, and the snowmelt water that could flow into the scenery that we haven't seen yet.
I still look back that night when the savior didn't visit, and in an instant, I realized that moment when I knew it wasn't true, even if it wasn't a lie at the time that my faith had collapsed.
Some of the people who celebrated the moment in a completely different way, and some of them are here after the same process as I followed, starting with the dawn of the new century, and starting with the beginning of the new century, my mother left and I couldn't keep in touch with my father, and even God had refused me that day.
I reached out my hand, and this time I was able to grab something that I could believe.
Eighteen-year-olds enrolled at Yale University, and I thought at the time that it was a great opportunity to break with all those dark pasts that I saw in Oakcliffe, Texas, shattered, people who had lost their dreams and their hopes.
But one day on my winter vacation, I was lying face down on the floor of my house, with my hands tightly tied behind me, and the robbers were sticking guns at my head, and I finally realized that education wouldn't save me.
I reached out to a company called Lehman Brothers, which I was looking for the next salvation.
We're going to make quick calls to the house, and we're going to have to suffer with money.
But even in that financial center, I made a noise in front of my eyes and collapsed, and even in business, I was abandoned.
I'm going to go to Washington, as a youth staff, and I'm reaching out to my next hope, and the voices I hear from Illinois are screaming out loud, "Time is coming, change is coming to America."
But Congress, the streak, the state rather tripped off hope, and the change became a joke that was not funny, and when politics came back, nothing happened, and they couldn't be saved.
I, named the American Dream, I swore my allegiance on that altar, and I knelt down to the god of capitalism, for the sake of success, for wealth, and for power.
But at the time of the date change, I opened my eyes, and I wondered if there really was no God.
That night, I decided to face it again, not because I was brave, but that I didn't die or believe, but that choice was no longer left.
And I took my steps to the next holy spot, because I knew that I wasn't happy with the sounding and extrated relief.
there's still not enough effort.
It was a night that had just begun, when the harsh winter of Cambridge had just begun, and in the unenhamored corner of the party, three friends and a topic came up, and it was a common topic, a young person, that everyone had at least once experienced, and it was a common topic because of his youth, and he said, "Let's go on a journey."
We didn't know where we were going, how we should go, and we didn't have any decisions.
But I was obsessed with Jack Kerouac's novel, and I said, "" Getting out of the night and quietly disappearing. "" We left to find out what was going on in this country.
Of course, there were a lot of voices that disagreed, and above all, his voice was very decent, but we took a step anyway.
In the summer of last year, a trip to the United States began, in the meadows of Montana, through the ruins of Detroit, through the swamps of New Orleans, and the way they go, and they do business for the lives of the people they meet.
It was more innovative to me, trained in the highest schools of capitalism.
This idea is going to swell, and it's going to turn into a nonprofit organization called MBAs Across America, and it's because of the waves that made me stand on the TED stage.
How greedy are our generation for purpose and meaning
And we realized that we needed a little bit more support from these many entrepreneurs who were creating jobs and changing them in the face of the sight of a wave.
We finally realized, and to be honest, another thing that's important is that I tried to make a wave.
There was a time when I thought that every single one of the companies could heal and comfort the wounds of this country that was about to collapse, and that many people would think so.
But this evangelism journey has led me to a new gospel, and that's why I stand here today.
It's an evening, about a year from now, and I was at the Natural History Museum in New York, and I'm at Harvard Business School, a group of alumni.
Under the life-size replica of the whales hanging on the ceiling, we shared a seat with the windy children of the times, and we honored each other's achievements and the spirit of social contribution.
The connections that came together, and their assets, were a space full of pride, like more than fifty billion dollars.
If you look at the results of our achievements, they're all beautiful.
But that's not the end. Two days later, I had a service to the Harlem area, and I was sitting in a corner of a farm built in a vacant lot, and I heard the stories of the children who came to the farm every day, from a man named Tony.
It's about these kids who live below the poverty line.
They're still carrying their luggage when they go to bed, because they don't get robbed in a homeless shelter.
"Harlem Grown" is a program that's called "" Then the kids come to the program, who comes to you once a day, for a meal.
After two decades of taxi drivers, Tony cut his pension and started the program.
He didn't get paid, because while he was growing in action, he was struggling with the money.
He said he was going to persevere with any straw.
And I'm determined to be that straw.
On the way home, a dull sound was slet in the back of my chest, and I just burst into tears.
I was so ignorant that under one roof, a replica of a whale floated, and people mobilizing fifty billion dollars gathered, and two days later, under the sky, just fifty blocks north, a man was running unpaid to prepare a meal for one child.
I didn't cry about inequality, not because of hunger or pity for homeless children, not because of the 1% of my anger on wealth, nor my sympathy for poverty by 99% of the population.
I was just upset, in a country with kidney disease, in the face of the fact that I was a dialysis device.
I realized that my story is for people who have to keep walking without shoes, even if they don't have shoes, that they've been overlooked, that they've been overlooked, that they've been able to deliver effective aid to the disaster-stricken areas of Harlem, the Appalachia, and New Orleans, and that's exactly what I should have done was all the voiceless voices that I've been seen as ineligible and innocent.
The flash completely embarrassed me, and I remembered that the new century of Peter Jennings had repeatedly been deceived and deceived by the unreasonableness that had been repeated many times.
it was fake.
But this time I was a false savior, and I was believing that the world would end, and that night I went a long way from that altar, and I thought that suffering was the atonement to God, and that the word of God was all, and the verse was the truth.
From that world I believed in, I'm on a long road, and I'm back at the starting point.
The present time in which we live is not an era of unbelief, but rather a time of unbelief, and rather, we believe in the past.
Brenne Brown, some of you might believe her words, maybe Tony Robbins.
"The New Yorker" "Harvard Business Review"
Some people believe them, and most of all, we don't pray in the church of TED right now, and we want to believe, we need to believe.
We want a leader who can solve all the problems.
They think that suffering is a necessary evil in God, capitalism, and they believe that the word "discretion" in technology is absolute.
But when we neglect to doubt one element of the foundation because we are afraid of what we believe will be shaken from the foundation, the human sacrifices that arise are overlooked.
If there's something you have to accept, it's time to stop and ask.
Creativity, innovation, society, the environment, the economic responsibility, the gospel, is not my domain.
In fact, we're not trying to spread a gospel with some doctrine here.
The existence of the gospel of doubt, that's why I'm here.
This gospel is not telling you to stop believing, but it's asking for a new attitude, and it's the idea that there's not one answer.
We accept the mistakes we've made, and we leave room for the question itself to admit its absurdity.
This gospel of doubt suggests that we may all be wrong in this space in this place.
And the question is, "Why." That's the gospel.
Where is the need for people to suffer in vain until they give up the power they have been given to us to re-examine?
And because of this belief that I'm going to re-examine it, I made a decision about my work, and I made a non-profit about my MBAs Across America.
We've cut down on the staff of the organization, we've stopped hiring new people, and we've made our business models available to people who need it, and we've made them available to the public.
The reason why the question was asked to me was to give up the role of the savior that people imposed on me, because our lives are too short to wait again for the second coming of Christ in the face of the truth that miracles don't happen.
This gospel of doubt, which is hopeless, and it gives you hope, even when it seems like there is no after, and it should inspire you to shine on it, even when it is painful, in the face of blind faith, in the mind of a stop-thinking, and the inner voice that dares to re-examine it, it is a small, tiny but irreplaceable light that illuminates the darkness, whether it's a whispering.
It's a scream, but it's just a simple voice, and it's like, "There must be another way."
thank you.
Food crisis
it's been in the news all the time.
What do you mean by that?
In the world, places are running out of food and oversupplied.
GMOs, on the other hand, are saving the world.
GMOs may have problems.
Excessive agricultural wastewater pollutes the ocean, inflows of poisons, and reduces nutritional value.
this is happening all the time.
I'm very disappointed with the discussion about the environment.
How can we solve this problem with our knowledge?
Let's take a look at the food problem of apples.
You must have eaten an apple last week.
How long do you think the apple has been picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months — the average for apples in an American grocery store.
I don't think there's much difference in Europe or the rest of the world.
There's also a record that they picked apples, stored them in the refrigerator, and that they encapsulated a gas for storage, and that the workers went into this storehouse and died trying to get the apple, because the air that slows down the apple rot is toxic to humans.
Why didn't anyone know about this?
Why didn't I know?
Ninety percent of the antioxidants in apples are lost by the time they are eaten.
This is just a chunk of sugar.
Why are we so understaffing? How can we improve?
because the platform is missing.
Speaking of platforms, computers. When I was young, I was very bad on the Internet.
I did it on this platform.
But I was able to meet people and express myself.
How to express yourself with food?
If you have a platform, you can also ask, "What if?"
My question was, what if the climate was equal for everyone?
This is the climate map of the world.
The places where productivity is high are shown are green, and the low places are shown in red.
The colors are moving and changing, and the agricultural center in California is now moving to Mexico.
China is growing better food on the land of Brazil, and we're submissive to the climate.
What if each country had a climate suitable for production?
How does that change people's lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem for the previous generation was that they had more food.
Welcome to the world of global farms
Humans built a giant analog farm.
The lines here show food transport connected by cars, airplanes, railways, etc.
It's a miracle that the food that supports seven billion people is produced by a small proportion of people.
if...
What if we could build a digital farm?
It's a digital farm that's spread around the
What if we could take this apple out, digitize it in some way, propagate it through the air as a particle, and reconfigure it somewhere else?
if...
I read the text here, and I was inspired to start this study.
The first thing is that there's no young labor, no water, no land, no future in Japanese agriculture, and at that time, I went to the one in the immediate [north] of Fukushima, which was the disaster.
Because the land was contaminated, the children moved to Sendai and Tokyo, and Japan already relied on imports for seventy percent of its food.
The food problem is not unique to Japan.
In the United States, the number of people working in agriculture is two percent.
No matter which country, two percent is limited in what you can do with less.
If you look at other countries, fifty percent of Africa's population is under the age of eighteen.
Eighty percent of them don't want to be farmers.
Agriculture is hard work.
Small-scale farming, farmers' lives are miserable.
and they're going to move to the cities.
In India, farmers don't even have water or electricity supplies, and the number of farmers who committed suicide this year has been the highest in a decade.
it's a really bad story.
Where are the farmers going?
urban areas.
Young people don't stay in the city, they all flow into the cities.
So how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
Introducing a new type of tractor!
This is the combine that I created.
Years ago, I went to a daily necessities store or a DIY store, and I started working.
We started to make strange things, and when we tried to make plants dance, and when we connected the plants to computers, they all died, and it was a terrible number.
I finally made it so that it wouldn't die.
I built one of the most intimate relationships in my life, and that's because I started to understand the language of plants.
He said he wanted to grow bigger.
They said, "Hey, do it!
No one wants to enter here, just an old electric laboratory.
What do you think you can do?
Together with my colleagues, I built a farm in the MIT Media Lab, which has been known as a laboratory for digital life, not biology.
In this space of about six square meters, we've produced enough food for three hundred people a month, and I can't say that it's a lot of...
and there's a lot of interesting technology in it
What's the most interesting thing about it?
Beautiful white roots, dark green vegetables, and a monthly harvest.
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
A new retail experience?
A new grocery store?
One thing I can say for sure is that it's the first case in a media lab that you've picked something from the roots.
There's a salad in the bag, but there's nothing wrong with it.
But what happens when you have a robot researcher who's an image processing expert, and you pick something from the root, and you think, "You can do this with your knowledge, let's try this?"
We're going to keep the plants here in the lab first before we take them out, because we don't want to throw away what we've grown, and that's a valuable thing.
My tongue has changed, and I'm going to taste it first, and I don't want people to eat it until I'm sure it's a decent food.
So we're eating lettuce every day, and we can see the pH of the lettuce with a margin of error within 0.1.
"Oh, that's PH6. I can't eat today."
the lettuce on this day was very sweet.
It's very sweet because plants are stressed, and they're trying to protect themselves, and they're going to have a chemical reaction inside, and they're very sweet, and they're like, "" I don't
The cry of such a plant makes it very sweet that I like.
A technologist who turned to plant physiology ...
I wanted to do this experiment for others.
I'm curious about what's being created. I've been thinking about a lab that can be delivered anywhere.
I made it first.
I have my lab on the front of the media lab, and there's about thirty sensors for each plant.
If you know about genomes and genetic engineering, this is the so-called phenome.
It comes from the word "phenomenon."
For example, "I like Mexican strawberries," which actually means that I prefer strawberries that I grew up with in a climate that would grow to your favorite taste.
So if you programmatically create that climate, you can program the combination of carbon dioxide and oxygen, and then you program the flavor, the nutrition, the size, the shape, the color, the texture of the plants.
This requires data, and we have a lot of sensors to get to know the situation, and I'm thinking about indoor horticultural plants, and when I look at this, I'm very sad, and I'm like, "Why are you dying?
Farmers predict plant growth, and they have the most amazing eyepower to bloom in their late 60s and 70s.
When plants are dying, they see why they need nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency, and moisture.
This wonderful eye power is not inherited.
This is the data that a farmer stored in the cloud.
Follow the changes in data over time.
It correlates these data with individual plants.
These are the ones in the lab one day, which are represented by IP addresses.
it's a broccoli that can grant an IP address.
(Applause) If you think there's not enough weirdness, click here to see the plant profile.
It's downloadable data about the growth of plants, and it's probably more than you can imagine, not just when you can eat it.
when and when you can get the nutrition you need
We predict when it will taste your favorite.
Are you watering too much?
Are you getting too much sunlight?
and we're going to give you a warning.
He talks to me, and he's intelligent. He has a common language in common with me.
(Applause) I think I'm the first facebook user in the plant world.
The first is that the profile of the plant and the plant begin to make friends.
It consumes smaller amounts of nitrogen, more potassium than more phosphorus.
It's going to be a good fit, and so far, we're learning the complexity of interplant relationships that we can only guess.
Plants may not recognize us as friends, but that's a possibility, depending on what we do.
This is my current lab.
I'm a little bit more orderly than I've ever done before, and I've had the experience of building data centers in different hospitals, and I'm a little bit knowledgeable about creating a managed environment.
And then I'm trying every experiment in this environment.
This method: Air cultivation was developed by NASA to reduce the water that is being carried out into space for the Mir space station.
Here, we're giving plants just what they need, water, minerals, and oxygen.
The roots are simple, and you just give them what you need, and they grow up so beautifully.
It's like a plant has two hearts.
It has two hearts, so it grows four or five times faster.
It's a complete world.
Humans have evolved technology over the years, and they've grown in tough environments, and they're still doing technological reform, but now they're creating new ways to do it, and it's a complete world.
We grew different kinds of plants.
This kind of tomato has not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that humans have rare and ancient seed banks?
it's a reservoir of seeds.
that's amazing.
Some species are preserved alive, and no one has ever spoken to them.
I'm the only one who ate these tomatoes in the lab.
The problem is that it's a tomato for sauce, and I don't know how to cook it, and I've tried tomatoes for sauce, but they're not delicious.
We used protein to grow a lot of things.
Human beings can do it, but they don't really.
Now, what we've come to understand is that the equipment is large and very expensive.
I wanted to spread it all over the world, but it became a device that cost about ten million yen.
I couldn't find anyone who could give me ten million yen quickly, and I wanted to make a small one.
This project was actually one of my students, and Camille, an undergraduate student studying mechanical engineering.
Camille, me and my friends, experimented over and over again throughout the summer, aiming for something that works cheaper and better for anyone to make.
and then i brought this in junior high school and high school.
If you want to make a fool of someone, teach your child something.
I went to school and I said, "Set the humidity to sixty-five percent."
The first student asks, "What's the humidity?"
And I said, "It's about the water in the air."
He says, "There's no water in the air. You're not stupid."
And I said, "You don't have to believe me.
Don't believe me.
Set it to 100%.”
He's set it to one hundred percent - what happens?
The water is clumped, the fog, and the water droplets finally fall.
He said, "What's the thing about the rain?
Why didn’t you say that?”
We created an input screen that was like a game.
3D display. You can log in from anywhere in the world. You can use your smartphone or tablet.
It can operate various devices and sensors of bots.
You can choose a recipe that other children from all over the world have made.
If you choose a recipe and start it, the seedlings will be planted.
It's also a change during growth.
“Why do plants need CO2? Is it harmful? It kills people.”
what are the words?
If you increase your CO2 concentration, plants will die.
If you lower CO2, the plants will be very healthy.
Once the plants are harvested, a new digital recipe is ready.
It's the process of repeatedly designing, developing, and exploring.
You can download data about the new plants they've developed, and new digital recipes, and the changes -- were they effective or vice versa?
Think of these as the core parts of the development process.
We're going to learn a lot.
This is what we call a food computer and what we call it, three weeks in school.
It will grow in three weeks.
What's more important is that this kid was the first time he thought, "I can be a farmer," and maybe he wanted to be a farmer.
So we opened up all the data.
It's all online. Let's build a food computer at home.
it can be a little difficult
It's a trial that's just beginning, but it's all in place.
It's very important that it's easy to get.
I'm going to make it more accessible.
They're farmers, electricians, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners.
Do what you are good at on one platform.
In this lab, it's getting narrower.
This is the new facility that I'm just starting to use.
There will be warehouses like this everywhere.
That's why we chose it.
We're trying to make something like this in the warehouse.
This is already real.
Please take a look
This is already there.
They grow green vegetables and Ebola vaccine, respectively.
One of the reasons these plants won the Grand Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was that they were ahead of Ebola research, which is amazing.
This plant produces a protein that is resistant to Ebola.
from pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements to lettuce.
It's not quite like lettuce, but that's the field I'm studying.
in every way we're going to be different.
We're still in early chaos, like, "It's our black box," "Buy me."
"No, I have a very valuable intellectual property.
He can't buy me.
In fact, it's only just beginning, and society is about to change.
We're looking for cheaper food, and we're looking for better, more environmentally friendly food.
The fact that McDonald's has published the contents of the chicken nuggets, which were always considered to be the most suspicious food at all times, shows that they are marketing in line with the changes in the world.
So let's take a look at the modern world.
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers, which operate in open phenome.
Unlike the open genome, we're like a wiki with a little bit of climate recipe added, and we can start it from the pull-down menu, and we can grow it.
What does this attempt look like in the world?
Do you remember that the world was connected by a line?
First, install the oscillator.
We don't send food itself, we start sending out information about food.
It's not just my illusion, it's already spreading in places like this.
There's a food computer, a food server, and a food data center, and by sharing information, people are connected.
The future of food supply is not about fighting against the shortcomings that we have.
We know what the downsides are.
The future food supply is a network that connects the next billion farmers, and the provision of the platform allows us to raise questions and provide solutions.
thank you.
Sometimes I'm a European, and sometimes I'm very sad.
Over a year, more than a million people have come to Europe for help, and our response has been, to be honest, poor.
It's really full of contradictions.
Two-year-old Alan Kurdi mourned the tragic death of her, but since then, more than two hundred children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
The international agreement allows for a share of responsibility for the acceptance of refugees, but acquiesces to the fact that the number of small Lebanese refugees exceeds the total number of refugees across Europe.
We are deplorable to the existence of the ship, but we have made it the only route of asylum to Europe.
Despite the labor shortage, we're excluding people who are economically and demographically in line with our talent needs.
They're opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, and while they're advocating liberalism, they're detaining young exiles with repressive policies, pulling their children away from their families, and confiscating the property of refugees.
Don't you think it's weird?
Why is there so much inhumane response to the humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people are indifferent, at least I don't want to believe that's why.
I think it's because of the lack of vision for politicians, a vision that adapts international refugee policy that was created more than fifty years ago in a time of changing globalization.
So I want to go back to basics and ask two very fundamental questions that we all have to ask.
First of all, why is the current system not working?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system was created by these people immediately after World War II.
The first goal is to give people a place to live safely and with dignity until they return home, when they turn their edges at the nation, or in the worst case, when they turn their edges at the people.
It was designed to prepare for the situation that we see in Syria today.
It's an international agreement signed by the governments of 147 countries, and through the Convention on the Status of Refugees in 1951 and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, an international organization, we've committed to mutual acceptance of refugees into our territory, and we're here to accept people fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system doesn't work.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies are blocking the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to assimilate to their refuges, and they can return to their homes.
In reality, it's going to be almost forever.
In theory, refugees are part of the world's responsibility.
In reality, it's a geographical issue, and countries adjacent to the conflict zone are taking on the vast majority of the world's refugees.
It's not because the rules are wrong, it's that the system isn't working.
We need to rethink that because we don't apply the rules properly to suit the changing world.
So what exactly is the current refugee system going to be?
Let me tell you a little bit.
But it's not from a top-down perspective from the institutional point of view, but from the perspective of a refugee.
First, imagine a Syrian woman.
Let's call him Amira.
It's the kind of woman who represents a lot of people in the area.
Amira is a woman, like 25% of the world's refugees, and she's a child, and the reason she can't go back home is because this is where the city she lived in, and as you can see, the city of Amira, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic city, but now it's buried in rubble.
i'm not in a situation where i can go home
But Amira doesn't have a way to resettle in a third country, because it's like a lottery, and it's only 1% of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family have to make almost impossible choices.
There are only three basic options.
the first is to take your family and go to the refugee camp.
There, despite the help, there's almost no future for Amira and her family.
Refugee camps are in the desert, many of them in the desert.
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of bullets at the border with Syria at night.
economic activity is constrained.
The quality of education is not good.
And around eighty percent of the camps around the world, this has been the case for at least five years.
Living there is miserable, maybe that's why only nine percent of Syrians actually choose this path.
And then there's the option of getting to the city, like Amman and Beirut in neighboring countries.
That's the choice that 75% of Syrian refugees have chosen.
But there, too, we face great difficulties.
Refugees don't usually have the right to work in these urban areas.
i don't get a lot of help.
In this case, after Amira and her family have exhausted their savings, there is almost nothing left, and there is a poverty life in the city.
The third option is that more and more Syrians are choosing it.
It's a phenomenon that we're seeing today in Europe, looking for a handful of hope for our families, risking our lives, on a very dangerous journey, to another country.
The whole world is pushing refugees to make these impossible choices, and they're only three options: camping, poverty in the city, and a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this is the international refugee system.
But the only thing I think is this is an illusion.
I think there's room for reconsideration.
The reason we're limited to these options is because we think there's only one way in our minds that refugees can choose, and that's the only thing we're going to do.
Politicians think that the issue of refugees is a "zero-sum" problem, that is, if they do something for them, it will take a toll on the public.
We tend to think that refugees are a burden, or a burden on society, and we tend to think of them as a common premise.
On the other hand, there are ways for refugees to contribute to society.
What I'm saying is that there's a way for everyone to benefit from the wider range of refugee choices, the host country, our communities, our communities, and the refugees themselves.
I think that the four ways I'm going to talk about it now can fundamentally change the way we think about refugees.
All four things have one thing in common: how we use globalization, liquidity, and the opportunities that markets create, and that changes the way we look at refugee issues.
The first idea is to create an environment for refugees, and it starts with a very basic perception that refugees are just like everyone else, and that they're just in an unusual situation.
I started researching in Uganda with my colleagues at the University of Oxford, and I looked at the economic activities of refugees.
I chose Uganda not because it's a host country that represents the world.
because we have a very good policy.
Unlike other host countries around the world, Uganda has given refugees an opportunity to economically.
They gave refugees the right to work and freedom of movement.
And that's a phenomenal achievement, both refugees and refugees.
In the capital, Kampala, twenty-one percent of the refugees had jobs, and forty percent of the hired people were citizens of the host country.
In other words, refugees created jobs, and they hired the citizens of the host country.
We've seen some great examples of active private operations, even in refugee camps.
For example, in a refugee settlement called Nakivale, a Congolese refugee was involved in a business of buying and selling digital music.
A Rwandan refugee's business was to provide young people with reusable game consoles and TVs.
Despite the toughest environment, we're working on something innovative, and this picture is from a Congolese called DeMoukei.
When I arrived at the living quarters, it was almost speechless, but I was a filmmaker.
He opened a community radio station with his friends and colleagues, and now he's borrowing a video camera to make a video.
I co-produced two documentary films at the request of my team, and I've been successful in my business with a few hands.
We should use these examples to determine how we respond to refugees.
We need to provide opportunities for refugees to thrive as human beings, rather than necessarily looking at them as dependent on humanitarian aid.
Of course, clothing, futons, places to sleep, food, everything is important in an emergency, but we need to look beyond that.
opportunities for communication, electricity, education, labor rights, and access to capital and banks.
We have to provide that to the benefit of the global economy, for us, and it's possible for refugees, and it should be.
The second is the idea of an economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all countries in the world accept refugees have policies like Uganda.
Most countries don't welcome refugees into parts of the economy in a way like Uganda.
But there are utility models that can be adopted.
Last April, I went to Jordan, with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier, and I was brainstorming during my stay, and I was talking to the international community and the Jordanian government in a way that was in line with Jordan's domestic development strategy.
We've come up with a way to give Syrians jobs, and it's an idea about the economic zone that explores the possibility of hiring refugees, together with the jobs of the Jordanian people in the host country.
There's an economic zone just 15 minutes from the Zaatari refugee camp, where 83,000 refugees live, and it's the King Hussein bin Talaar development zone.
The Jordanian government has invested more than a million dollars to connect this area to the electricity supply and road networks, but there are two things that are missing: labor and inward investment.
What if refugees could work here? What if they couldn't be locked up in a camp, and they could feed their families, learn their skills through vocational training, and then return to Syria?
I thought this would be beneficial to Jordan, because Jordan's development strategy as a middle-income country needs to develop domestic manufacturing.
It's also beneficial for refugees, but it's also contributing to the rebuilding of post-conflict Syria, based on the recognition that we need to protect and train refugees, which will eventually be the best human resources to rebuild Syria.
I published this idea in the political magazine Foreign Affairs.
It caught the eye of King Abdullah.
Two weeks ago, at a Syria support conference in London, there was an announcement that it would be conducted on a trial basis this summer.
(Applause) I want to propose that the third idea is a matching system between a country and a refugee, and it's going to lead to happy results like this: Syrian refugees take selfies with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It's rare for refugees to ask what they want to go to, but it's possible for everyone to get it while listening to the voices of the refugees.
The concept of matching theory developed by economist Alvin Ross is that the final combination is determined by the ranking of the parties.
My colleagues, Will Jones, and Alex Tytelboim, have explored a way to apply this concept to refugees, who want to accept them in order of their choice, and they can also host countries, where they want to be, by prioritizing them on the conditions of their work skills, language, and so on.
Now, of course, we should consider factors such as diversity and vulnerability in terms of acceptance, but we can also think of it as a way to increase the matching rate.
The concept of matching is well used, including the university's acceptance of students, kidney donors and patients, algorithms that are used on dating sites.
Let's take this in order to expand the options for refugees.
It's also available on a domestic scale, and one of the biggest challenges we face is that it convinces local communities that they accept refugees.
Now, for example, in my country, in the UK, we often do the absurdity of sending engineers to the countryside and farmers to cities.
So if you match the market, you can match the wishes of both parties, and you can hear the needs and requests from the residents and refugees.
And the fourth idea is humanitarian visas.
Most of the tragedies and disruptions that are happening in Europe are completely avoidable.
It's because of the fundamental contradictions in Europe's refugee regulations, and what does it mean is that in order to become an exile in Europe, you have to arrive on an dangerous journey without preparation, but why do you need that kind of journey?
In this day and age, where low-cost airlines and consular services are plentiful, these journeys are completely unnecessary, but last year, more than three thousand people died, on the borders of Europe, in Europe.
The simple thing is that refugees can be avoided if they're allowed to travel normally to Europe and become exiles, and the way to do this is called a humanitarian visa, which allows you to get a visa at the embassy or consulate in your neighbouring country, and you can simply pay for your own travel and travel to Europe by ferry or plane.
Using smugglers to cross from Turkey to the Greek islands for a thousand euros.
Cheap flights from Bodrum to Frankfurt are €200
There's a huge advantage to releasing these options to refugees.
A lot of lives were lost, the refugee smuggling industry itself went up in business, and chaos disappeared from the front lines of Europe, like the Greek islands.
It's not rational measures that are blocking these measures, but the policy.
This idea is actually being incorporated.
Brazil was the first to take this approach, and more than 2,000 Syrians took humanitarian visas to enter Brazil, and as soon as they arrived, they were granted refugee status.
All of the Syrians who used this system have acquired the status of refugees and have been officially recognized as refugees.
there's a precedent in history.
Between 1922 and 1942, we used Nansen passports as international identity cards, and we had some 45 million Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens traveling around Europe, and they applied for asylum in other countries in Europe.
The Nansen International Refugee Office won the Nobel Peace Prize, and this realistic strategy was recognized by the world.
All four of the ideas I've just talked about are the way to increase the choice of temporary refugees Amira at the beginning.
It's a way to expand the range of options for refugees, and that doesn't limit yourself to the three unreasonable options that I mentioned at the beginning, and yet others benefit.
In conclusion, we need a new vision, a vision that knows that we need to expand our options for refugees, but not be a burden.
The idea that refugees are inevitably a burden is wrong.
It's a humanitarian obligation, but refugees are people with skills, talents, and abilities, and they have the power to contribute to society as long as they have the opportunity.
In the coming era, people who are migrating in the world will never stop.
What's going on in Europe will go on for years to come.
Refugees should continue to move and wander in search of a place, and we should explore ways to deal with this situation in a rational and realistic way to take advantage of the opportunities that we create, such as globalization, market, liquidity, and so on, not on the old theory of humanitarian aid or the idea of charity.
I want to appeal to all of you and to all of you, politicians, and wake up and face this challenge.
thank you.
I've admired the ocean since I was a child.
It's a beautiful place full of color and life, the home of alien-like, strange creatures.
I imagined that big sharks were in control of the food chain, and I imagined elegant sea turtles swimming across the reef.
I turned from a marine biologist to a photographer, and I've devoted most of my work to finding the magical place I dreamed of when I was little.
As you can see, I've been exploring the water since I was quite a little bit older.
But the first time I really dived into the water was when I was about ten years old.
I still remember vividly swimming, trying to touch an old cannon on a shallow coral.
And finally, when I caught it and looked up, I was immediately surrounded by colorful fish, and that was the day I fell in love with the sea.
Thomas Peschuk, conservationist, photographer, who has lived on Earth for forty years, and I have had the precious opportunity to explore the wonderful oceans for National Geographic and Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've been photographing everything, from a very large shark to something that's cute in the palm of your hand.
Off the cold Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, a very swollent humpback whale was present at a place to feed just 30cm away.
I've also been here in the Strait of Mozambique to see green turtles mating.
Everyone on the planet and the ocean have had an impact.
And it's getting harder and harder to find the untouched sea that I dreamed of when I was a kid.
They're being cornered and threatened.
We have been the main catchers on the planet, and I have witnessed and photographed the effects of the increasing number of people.
I've been thinking for a long time that I'm going to be interested in shocking photos and being shocked.
This is also an advantage, but I've gone back to the starting point.
I thought the best way to cause change was to appeal to love.
Maybe I'm a kind of matchmaker, and as a photographer, I've had the opportunity to reveal the whole of the animals and the ecosystem that's hidden beneath the sea.
If you don't know what it is, you can't value it, you can't defend it.
Revealing the hidden picture is the power of conservation photography.
I've visited hundreds of ocean waters, and I've been particularly impressed by some of them.
It was a decade ago that I first experienced that excitement off the rocky, unexplored coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, a huge flock of sardines make a great migration to the north, called the Sardine Run.
There's a good reason for this.
because the hungry, fast-moving catchers are secretly chasing them with great force.
In general, dolphins hunt in multiple groups, pull some sardines away from the herd, and make a spherical herd called bait ball.
We chase fish to the surface of the ocean, and we have this living and moving food.
There's a shark right behind it.
Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but they actually coexist during the sardine run.
Dolphins help sharks feed efficiently.
Without dolphins, bait balls would be more dispersed, and sharks would get nothing, including water, in their mouths, in what they called sardine donuts.
Now, I've experienced some exciting moments with sharks at Sardin Run, and I know they're not feeding me.
But in this rough party, like the other fish, they hit and they hit with fins.
Moving east from the African coast, across the vast Indian Ocean, you're going to end up in the mordib islands, which are made of coral.
During the intense southwest monsoon season, onitomachiai come from all over the islands, very small places in the Baa atoll called Hanifal, usually with a large amount of crustacean smaller than the human eye, a staple of Oniitmaki rays.
If there's a slump in the plankton's place, Oniitomakiei feeds it alone, and then, again and again, they sorber around, and they look like the puppies that chase their tails.
But when plankton are concentrated in one place, the rays line up to form a long chain for feeding, and even if the rays near the front take a little plankton and let them escape, the next one will swallow.
As the amount of plankton increases, rays swim closer to each other, and this unique behavior is called cyclone feeding.
Aye swirls in a solid formation, becomes a column of many layers, and he creates a vortex, collects and inhales the plankton, and carries it to his cave-like mouth.
The experience of diving surrounded by hundreds of groups of rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first shot in Hanifal, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like Manta Trust, my photos helped Hanifal become a marine protected area.
Fishermen in the neighboring islands used to catch rays to make traditional drums with the skins of rays.
Now they're more engaged in conservation than anyone else, and thanks to Aye, they're now earning eight million dollars more every year in Mordib.
I've always wanted to go back in the past, and I'd like to go back in time, where the map is almost empty, and it's written, "Here's a dragon
The closest I've been to the ocean of those times was the atoll on the west side of the Indian Ocean.
Far from the sea traffic and fishing fleets, diving into the sea, you can feel the pain of the sea.
Most people have never heard of the small coral reef in the Mozambique Strait, called Basas da India.
The reef is a barrier, and the reef inside is a growing ground for the galapago sharks.
This shark is not very cowardly, even during the day.
I had a feeling that I might be more bold at night and come out more.
Have you ever seen so many sharks in one coral outcrop?
By capturing and sharing moments like this, we can remember why we went this way.
I've already done my job at National Geographic in the Baja California Peninsula this year.
Half way across the Pacific side of the peninsula, there's the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is an important breeding ground for gray whales.
This coast was a hundred years of mass killings, and more than twenty thousand gray whales were killed and only a few hundred survived.
Today, the descendants of the whale gently push their children to the surface of the ocean, let them play, even interact with us.
This species has made a truly amazing comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula is a quiet fishing town called Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the verge of collapse after decades of overfishing.
In 1995, a local fisherman appealed to the ocean to be designated as a marine protected area.
What happened after that was nothing but a miracle.
Even though it's only been a decade since we started protecting it, the number of fish has recovered unprecedentedly.
But look at it with your own eyes. Let's go together.
Take a breath, dive deep, and swim among the largest and densest fish I've ever encountered.
Everyone can create hope.
I want to tell you through my pictures that it's not too late to protect our oceans.
I want to focus on the resilience of nature, especially when we're in front of seven billion people.
My wish is that if we don't look for it in the future, we won't be able to take pictures like this, and we're going to take pictures that are a set of coexistence with the ocean.
I just hope it happens on a daily basis.
In order to survive in my profession and move on, I have to be an unworkable optimist.
I've always worked on my assumption, and I think there's a great picture that's going to change, right around the corner, in the reef lake beyond the coral, or beyond.
When I moved to Harare, at the core of Zimbabwe's health policy, social justice was at the core.
At the end of the long war of independence, a new government emerged, and immediately declared socialist policies, and the medical services, primary education, etc., were basically free.
We've significantly increased the number of community health facilities, and we've achieved a tremendous amount of progress, with about eighty percent of the population getting their hands on the medical facility within two hours of walking.
In the 1980s, when Zimbabwe became independent, the vaccination rate for children in the country was 25%.
Just ten years later, in 1990, it reached 80 percent.
I was really proud to be involved in this great reform.
The excitement and the unity of the people were so visible.
I felt like I was part of a very talented, local, science, doctor, activist, and not just an African independence movement, but a part of the world-leading public health movement.
But there was a terrible problem.
The year I arrived, Zimbabwe's first AIDS case was reported in 1985.
I had seen some AIDS patients at Harlem General Hospital, where I was a resident in the early '80s, and I had no idea what was approaching Africa.
The HIV infection rate at the beginning of my stay was about two percent.
It was going up, and one in four adults was infected, seventeen years after I left Harare.
By the mid-90s, I had told hundreds of people in the prime of their jobs that I was HIV positive.
I've experienced the deaths of my colleagues and friends, and I've seen the deaths of students and patients.
In response, I set up a clinic with my colleagues.
Demonstrate how to use condoms.
Start sex education at school or at work.
we can do case studies, we can teach our infected partners how to prevent it.
I was working hard, and at that time I thought I was doing my best.
I thought I was doing a good treatment, and now I think about it, but it was poor.
But we didn't do anything to call for structural reform.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, frankly, turned his own mistakes into genocide in Rwanda.
He said he was going to go to the United Nations Secretary-General of the PKO.
At the memorial service in the 10th year of the massacre, I remembered, "I was convinced at the time that I was doing my best, but I realized that there was more that we could do, and there was more we could do, and we had to do something to help."
The AIDS outbreak was a slap in the face of the medical community, and I'm not the only one who regrets that the World Health Organization's prediction is that now that thirty-nine million people have died of AIDS, and that they should have done it faster.
But during my stay in Zimbabwe, I didn't put myself in a position to advocate for change or a political position.
I came here as a clinician and as an epidemiologist to use my professional skills.
In my mind, I thought that my job was to take care of the patient, to do research, to better understand the infection patterns of the population, and to stop the spread of this virus.
I realized that there was a high risk of developing and dying from AIDS due to the bias of the socially vulnerable.
More than any modern-day corporate organization, a sugar cane farm, like a feudal-era manor, sixty percent of pregnant women were HIV-positive.
Just because you're infected, you're not sluct, but rather a male-dominated culture, a forced seasonal work, a product of colonialism.
The whites were hardly harmed.
As health care workers, we were so painfully powerless that we just begged them to use condoms to reduce their sexual intercourse.
The infection rate was only going up, and it was the most effective treatment for AIDS in the West, and it was still out of reach for any public sector in Africa.
I kept quiet, and I didn't say anything about the way the system of politics and the economy under the AIDS epidemic, even though we didn't get the drugs that could save lives equally, and that we had this massive impact of the pandemic.
I justified my silence, and I said to myself, "I'm not a resident of this country, and if I sound the alarm, I might be deported, I wouldn't be able to do a good job, I wouldn't be able to see patients, I couldn't do the research I needed."
So I kept quiet, and I didn't say anything about the government's policy on AIDS at the time.
I didn't fully assert my concerns.
I think a lot of doctors and health workers wouldn't have failed.
It's a promise between a doctor and a patient, and another edition of the Hippocratic Oath, which enshrines the sanctity of the relationship between doctors and patients.
I did everything I could to help my patients, and I did the best I could for every patient.
But I knew that this pandemic was a reflection of the distortions of society, not only because of the biological causes, but rather because of the practice of alienating, excluding, and discriminating against the weak, based on the race, gender, the social class, and so on.
AIDS is this.
It was the same with recent Ebola.
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, who has been working against AIDS in Haiti, call this "structural violence," is called "structural," because inequality is embedded in the political and economic structure of our society, and it's often invisible to people with privileges and power, and that's because what we call violence is because death, suffering, and disease at young age are violent because this phenomenon brings about.
If we want to help patients a little bit, we must not neglect to recognize these social inequalities.
Calling attention is the first step in making public health work, so that we can bring together collaborators, pave the way together, and make real change.
so i haven't been quiet lately.
I'm talking about a lot of things, and the people who listen, they're talking, they're talking, they're still speaking, even when they're awkward.
In many cases, it's about race inequality, about institutionalized racism, and things that can't be done in this country anymore, even more than not, in the medical field or in public health.
Because of that, in return, people are losing their lives without ending their lives.
So we should be sounding the alarm — racism in American healthcare, and ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence — the violence that people of color are ongoing, and it's at the heart of my New York City health director's mission to sound the alarm about the 250-year-old slavery, the nine-hundred-year-old Jim Crow system, the violence that has been exacerbated by the decade of imperfect equality, and so on.
Young people under the age of 65 have a 50 percent higher mortality rate in New York City than black men.
In 2012, the maternal mortality rate of black women was more than ten times that of white women.
Infant survival has improved dramatically, but black infants are still nearly three times more likely to die in the first year of life than white infants.
New York is not special.
Similar statistics can be found anywhere in the United States.
According to a recent New York Times analysis, one and a half million black men are missing out across the United States.
According to the article, today, more than one in six black men between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four has disappeared from their daily lives, whether they died while in prison or at a young age.
There's a lot of injustice, and it's just a young black man, the unjustified violence that happens every day, and it's the violence that's the subject of a protest called #BlackLivesMatter.
But it's important to remember that although each of them has a different incidence, it's a common disease outbreak that keeps occurring, and its consequences, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS, which are slowly and quietly dying, and black people are dying even more.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement started, I was frustrated and angry, because in the medical community, we've been avoiding even using the word "racism" in research and work.
Every time I use that word, I don't think you've ever thought about anything.
In addition to the medical students who were dressed in white-robed corpses and protesting, most of the medical community was standing on the sidelines, doing nothing, and the discrimination that still exists continues to affect the appearance of the disease and the death rate.
Modern trends in personalized medicine and precision medicine are inadvertently looking for more personalized treatment, in the pursuit of biological and genetic research, inadvertently losing the whole picture, the daily environment—the daily environment—the daily environment in which people live, grow, work, and love each other, which is the most affecting people’s health and harming the health of so many people.
As health care workers, we're witnessing a great injustice in our daily work, both in the clinic and in our research, and the fact that homeless people can't do what doctors teach, because there's a more scared, more urgent priority, because transgender young people think about suicide because of a society that's so ruthless, that's a responsibility for the health of their children.
The role of a physician as a health care worker is not just to look at patients, but to be advocates for attention and change.
Doctors, regardless of their legitimacy, have a lot of weight on their voices because of their social status, and we shouldn't waste it.
I regretted not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I took my oath, and as the New York City Department of Health, I used the opportunity I had to the fullest extent, to call attention, and to help improve the health carity.
We're going to tackle racism, and we're going to help you, and when you're confronting gender discrimination, I'm going to help you, and I'm going to help you with inequality in any other way.
Now is the time for us to stand up and raise our voices as a group against structural inequality.
You don't have to know all the answers to call for change.
It just takes courage.
The health of our patients and the health of all of us.
I'd like to ask you to raise your hand, but have you ever released a friend on Facebook? It's because they've made some unpleasant statements about politics, religion, parenting, and food.
Who doesn't want to talk, and there's at least one person who's avoiding?
In the past, in order to be polite and have a conversation, I wish I had talked about the weather and my health according to Professor Higgins of My Fair Lady.
These days, climate change, anti-immunizations, and it's no longer a safe topic.
In the world where we live, every conversation is likely to develop into a controversial, and politicians can't talk to each other, and there are people who are in stumped, in favor, who argue against each other, even in real trivial issues.
A Pew laboratory surveyed ten thousand American adults, and now we know that people are becoming more polarized and more at odds than ever before in history.
They don't want to compromise, they don't listen.
And we decide based on our belief that we already believe where we live, who we marry, and who we want to be friends with.
This, too, is that we don't have ears to listen.
Conversations need a balance between talking and listening, but somewhere we lost that balance.
and the development of technology is one of the reasons.
You can still have your phone in your hands or within your reach.
According to the Pew Research Institute, a third of teenagers send more than a hundred messages a day.
Probably, most of them are more likely to make a mess than to talk face-to-face.
Magazine "Atlantic"
There's an interesting article written by a high school teacher called Paul Barnewell.
He gave his students a communication challenge.
I wanted to teach them how to talk about specific subjects without using notes.
He wrote, "I've noticed --"
“The ability to have a conversation is the most overlooked skill that teachers are out of the way.
Students interact with ideas and other people through screens for hours every day, but they have few opportunities to hone their interpersonal skills.
It sounds strange, but we have to ask ourselves, is there anything more important than the ability to speak with the right and confident sense in the 21st century?
I'm working on speaking, Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, head of state, plumbers.
I talk to people I like and people I don't like.
Personally, I'm talking to people who disagree with me.
And yet, we can have great conversations with them.
I'm going to show you how to talk and how to listen in the next ten minutes.
You've probably heard a lot about the secret of a conversation, whether it's looking into the other person's eyes, or thinking about a topic you're interested in in advance, or looking at someone with caution, hitting a hammer, smiling, or repeating the other person's words, or summing it up.
Forget all that.
it's not helpful.
You don't have to learn how to make it look like you're listening carefully, and if you're actually listening carefully, you'
(Applause) I use my professional interviewer skills in my normal life.
I'm going to teach you how to do interviews, and it helps you improve your conversation, and you learn how to talk to each other, not waste your time, you don't get bored, you don't hurt them.
we've all had great conversations.
I know what it's like.
It's a conversation that makes you feel like you're parting, that you've been able to make a real connection to the person you're drawn into and inspired by, and that you're completely understood.
There's no reason why most of the conversations shouldn't be like that.
Let's take a look at the ten basic rules of conversation together, and if you master one of them, you'll be able to enjoy a better conversation.
The first one is, “Do not do it.”
It's not just about stopping cell phones, tablets, car keys, もて to play.
It means that your body and your mind are there.
to be in that moment.
Don't think about arguing with your boss.
Don't think about what to do for dinner.
If you want to get out of the conversation, please get out of the conversation, but stop participating for half of it.
Number two, don’t talk to one side.
If you want to claim your opinion without a reaction, argument, argument, or opportunity for growth, write a blog.
The reason I don't put people on my shows who speak arbitrarily is because they're boring.
If you're a conservative, you don't like Obama, you don't like food stamps, you hate abortion.
If you're a liberal, you'd hate big banks, oil companies, Dick Cheney.
i understand what you're saying.
it won't be like that.
We need to go into a conversation with the attitude that we should have something to learn.
The famous therapist, M. Scott Peck, said, "You really need to put yourself aside in order to really listen."
This means that sometimes you need to put your opinion aside.
“When you feel accepted, you don’t feel defenseless, and you start to show it to the listener, even to the depths of your heart.”
I repeat, let's take a stance of learning.
Bill Nye said, “Everyone you meet knows something they don’t know.”
And I said, "Anyone can be an expert."
The third is to ask free questions.
Let's learn from journalists.
Ask questions that start when/where/who/what/why/how.
If you ask a complicated question, you're just going to get a simple answer.
If you ask me, “Was it scary?”
In response to the most memorable words in the question, in this case, "I was scared" and the answer is "yes" or "no."
"Are you mad?" "Yes, I was very angry."
let me explain it to you. i know what's over there.
I ask this question, "What did it look like?"
"How did you feel?"
Then they'll have to stop and think, and they'll get a much more interesting answer.
Number four, let’s get into the flow.
The idea that came to mind has to go out.
You've often heard interviews like this, and after a few minutes of talking to a guest, the host's question is completely irrelevant, or something like that that you've answered before.
The moderator had stopped asking him two minutes ago, and he came up with a clever question, and he decided that he had to say it.
We're doing exactly the same thing.
I remember when I was sitting with someone and talking to an actor, Hugh Jackman, when I came across him in a coffee shop.
and stop listening.
Talks and ideas come to mind.
Let's just float and disappear.
Number five, if you don't know, I'll tell you I don't know.
I know that people who are on the radio, especially in the case of NPR, are on the record, so be very careful when you say that you know something that is an expert or something.
You guys do too, and you can be too careful.
Don't make it cheap.
Number six, don't share your experience with yourself.
It's about not telling the story of the person who lost their family when they're talking about losing their family.
It's about not telling people how much they don't like their job when they're talking about problems in the company.
Your experience is very different.
All the experience is individual.
And more importantly, I'm not talking about myself.
You don't have to try to show how great or how much trouble you are on that occasion.
Stephen Hawking was asked about his IQ and he said, "Come on, I'm proud of my IQ, and that's a loser."
Conversations are not an opportunity to self-promote.
"How's it going today?" "Look at the blog!" The seven: "Don't say the same thing over and over again."
They're ungrateful, they're tired of being stunned, but they're all prone to doing
Especially in a conversation at work, or in a conversation with a child, who changes his words and repeats it, in an attempt to show that his claims are correct.
That's not it.
Number eight, don’t worry about the details.
Frankly, they don't care about the details, they're detailed, like the year, their names, their dates, and they're struggling to remember.
They're not interested. They're interested in you.
What are you and what do you have in common?
so let's forget the details. we don't need it.
That's nine, but it's not the last one, but it's the most
"Listening"
I don't know how many great people have said this, but listening is the most important skill that everyone can develop.
It's Buddha's word, and it's a little paraphrase, "When you're open-mouthed, you learn nothing."
According to Calvin Coolidge, the most famous president, “No one has been fired because of what they heard.”
Why don't we listen to each other?
One is that we want to talk rather than listen.
When you're talking, you're leading yourself.
You don't have to ask what you're not interested in.
Be the focus of attention.
You can strengthen your identity.
But there's another reason: it distracts us.
Ordinary people speak twenty-five words a minute, but we can hear up to five hundred words a minute.
Our consciousness tries to fill the 275 words of surplus.
It certainly takes effort and energy to keep an out-prate about them, but if you can't, you're not having a conversation.
They're both in the same place, screaming for unrelated words.
We have to ask each other.
The writer Stephen Covey speaks brilliantly.
"A lot of people don't listen to me to understand.
I am listening to you to respond.”
There's another rule: the ten are simple.
[My sister said, "" Good conversation is like a miniskirt, that's as short as it's going to be interesting, but to cover what's important, and to keep it as long as possible. "" (Applause) Everything I've said so far can be summed up in one thing, and I'm going to say, "" Be interested in the other person.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and it was a routine thing in my house.
When I talk to my grandparents, a lot of people come in, and after the customer leaves, my mother comes and asks, "Do you know who that person is?"
she became quasimis America.
that's the mayor of sacramento.
She's the Pulitzer Prize winner, and he's a dancer from the Russian Ballet.
so that everyone has something hidden, something amazing.
I started to believe, and I think this is what makes me a good moderator.
I'm hoping to be able to keep my mouth shut, open my heart, and be impressed as much as I can, and I've never been disappointed before.
please do the same.
Go out, talk to people, listen, and most importantly, expect to be impressed.
Thank you for your attention.
hello.
i'm my mathew willis. i'm the champion.
I've won my third sports medal at the Canadian national championships, and I'm honored to have participated in world-class games in basketball, and I've been to the World Games as a Canadian national team.
(Applause) Five days a week, he's been training for basketball and speed skating, and his top coaches and mental performance consultants are helping them get the best out of the game.
By the way, this is all about the Special Olympics.
Does that change the way you see me and my achievements?
The world doesn't necessarily see people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were marginalized and out of public.
It's changed a lot since the start of the Special Olympics, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider world.
I don't think it's a bad thing for everyone to use discriminatory terms in front of my eyes.
We use the word "wisteningly" in contempt.
So I'm not thinking about how much it hurts me and my friends.
don't think of me being here as an object of pity.
I'm here because there's still a serious problem with the public's view of people with intellectual disabilities, and in too many cases, the problem is that I don't see anything.
Did you know that there was a world championship this year?
I was one of six thousand five hundred athletes with intellectual disabilities, and athletes from sixteen hundred countries came together in LA to compete.
More than sixty-two thousand spectators watched the opening ceremony, and the sports television stations TSN and ESPN broadcasted live.
You didn't know that tournament, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
It's a challenge for you. Can you see us as equals?
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities, the values of all who see it.
For those who don't know, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It's different from the Paralympics and the Olympics.
High-level sports competitions are held for people with intellectual disabilities throughout the year, and the lives and values of the people involved change.
This has changed my life, and the lives of so many other people.
And the public eye has changed to see the intellectually disabled.
I'm born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
I've been playing hockey since I was twelve.
As I grew older, it became more and more difficult to keep up with everyone, and it was frustrating and infuriating.
I was completely out of the sport for a while, and I didn't have many friends, and I felt like I was left behind, and I was sad.
In the past, people with intellectual disabilities were uncovered by society.
No one thought that he could be a part of sports, or that he was a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the motor skills of children with intellectual disabilities.
The strictly scientific method of study, Dr. Hayden and other researchers, concluded, is that the lack of motor skills in children with intellectual disabilities is simply because they lack the opportunity to participate in the movement.
For people with intellectual disabilities, exercise programs and sports competitions are beneficial.
There weren't many people who believed it, but the pioneers, Dr. Hayden and the founder of the Special Olympics, Eunice Kennedy Schriver, did not give up, and the athletes have proven more than four and a half million times that they were right.
(Applause) Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was worried, because I was young, shy, unsure, and I had few friends.
But when I went, everyone encouraged me, they supported me, and I couldn't care about people's eyes, and I could be who I was.
Now I'm a basketball and speed skater, and I've been in state and national competitions, and this year I've competed in the summer world championships in LA, and I'm a member of the basketball team, which was my first time representing Canada, and I've been part of the basketball team.
(Applause) I'm one of the more than four and a half million athletes in the world, and I've heard a lot of similar stories.
Being a Special Olympic Athlete brings back pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also caters to the health needs of athletes.
According to the study, men with intellectual disabilities have a life expectancy of thirteen years shorter than healthy people, and in women, they are twenty years shorter.
But with Special Olympics, you can keep your body healthy by moving and participating in competitions.
And the coaches will teach you about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics offers free medical check-ups, which are subject to difficult communication with doctors and hard-to-reach medical attention.
In the summer of this year, my team, Canada, played against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian team had a health check-up at the venue, seven of the ten members, seven of whom received free hearing aids, and thanks to this, they were able to clearly hear for the first time in their lives.
(Applause) The players have seen a remarkable change.
I was able to live more vividly, enjoy the game, play with confidence, because I was able to communicate with my coach in my voice.
I was stunned, because I was able to hear the sound of the ball, and the sound of the whistles, the cheers of the fans standing in the stands, and it was a natural sound for everyone.
the athletes of the special olympics are not only in the competition
It changes your life outside the stadium.
According to a survey conducted this year, nearly half of U.S. adults do not know anyone with any intellectual disabilities, and forty-four percent of Americans have a very low acceptance and a significantly negative view of people with disabilities.
And the high use of these discriminatory words is evidence that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to so many people.
We all use it as a casual expression or a word.
Last year, I tweeted more than nine million times, and that's what hurt me and the four and a half million of my athletes around the world.
I don't think everyone's going to be an insult, but that's a mistake.
My fellow global messenger John Franklin Stevens wrote an open letter, which was addressed to a political commentator who used the discriminatory language, and he said, "Come to Special Olympics someday.
Give it a try, whether you can go home without being moved.”
(Applause) This summer, at the World Games, people lined up for hours to see the last day of the weightlifting competition.
In the midst of everyone standing, my teammate Jackie Barrett, commonly known as Newfoundland's deer, lifted 297kg in a deadlift, 277kg in a squat — (Applause) and broke the record for the best in the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder of weightlifting on Newfoundland, not just among the special Olympicss, but among all the weightlifters.
He became a big star in LA, and the ESPN team tweeted his new record live, and he was impressed by Jackie's performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one thought that an intellectually disabled person could do that.
Sixty thousand spectators filled that famous LA Memorial Coliseum this year, and they packed to watch the opening ceremony of the World Congress, and to support the athletes from sixteen hundred and sixty-five countries around the world.
Instead of being a hidden entity, we were cheered and honored.
Special Olympics teaches us to be confident and proud of our athletes.
It teaches the people of the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and acceptance.
(Applause) Now I have a track record in competition, a great coach, a respect and dignity, a healthier, a personal trainer.
(Applause) I'm not hiding or being bullied anymore, I'm doing TED talks right now.
(Applause) The special Olympics have changed the world, but we still have a long way to go.
Next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I want you to see their abilities.
If you see someone who uses a discriminatory language, I want you to tell me how bad it is.
And I want you to think about getting involved in the Special Olympics.
(Applause) Finally, I'll just say one word.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
Special Olympics is really changing the world, where four and a half million athletes are reborn, where they can be confident, they can make friends, they can't see them with prejudice, they can feel the mood of champions, and they can actually become champions.
thank you.
kenema in sieraleone, arua, nigeria, have you ever heard of such a place name?
It's one of the rarest places for me.
In the hospital, nurses, doctors, and scientists have been fighting one of the most terrifying enemies of humanity for years, Lassa virus.
the lassa virus is very similar to the ebola virus
It causes a high fever, and sometimes it takes life.
But they're at risk every day, and they're protecting all of us by protecting the people of the local community.
But the most surprising thing that came to me years ago was that every morning they started singing songs on the harsh frontline.
We all come together to express our joy.
it's going to energize you.
It's been years since we've been visiting each other, and we've been together, we've been singing, we're really having a lot of fun, and we're not there just for the pursuit of science, we're in love with each other.
I think you can imagine that as things change, it's going to be very important and essential.
That changed a lot in March, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa near the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa.
we're afraid.
In fact, for a while, Lassa and Ebola were more likely to be infected than we thought, and I thought we might one day reach Kenema.
So my team members immediately took action and joined Dr. Humah Khan's team, so we had a highly sensitive virus RNA detector that was ready to detect Ebola when it crossed the border and reached Sierra Leone.
We already used this device for the Lassa antivirus, so we knew how to do it, and the team was very good.
All they had to do was provide them with the tools and a place to test for Ebola.
But unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23rd, a woman was admitted to a hospital maternity ward, and the team tested for virus RNA, and they confirmed the first Ebola case in Sierra Leone.
Their work was very good.
We started contact tracing to instantly determine this case, to treat the patient safely, and to keep track of the situation.
This could have stopped the spread of the virus early.
But by that day, the outbreak had already been going on for months.
Hundreds of cases occurred, surpassing the previous outbreak.
When we reached Sierra Leone, we were not in a single case, but like a tsunami.
We worked with international communities, the Department of Health, and the government offices of Kenema to tackle this infection, because the following week, 31 cases and 92, then 147 cases, all patients flowed into Kenema, because there were limited facilities in Sierra Leone that could handle the disease.
We did everything we could, and we saved our patients, we drew our attention, and we did another simple thing.
Of course, I was glad to have discarded the blood samples of the patients that were taking them to detect Ebola.
Instead, they inactivated the virus with drugs, packed blood samples into boxes, and sent them across the ocean to other research facilities.
I'm with my team. I sent it to Boston.
And then I kept working day and night, working shifts every day, and I quickly analyzed ninety-nine zynoms of the Ebola virus.
The virus's ginom is the blueprint.
Ginom is for everyone.
It represents the nature of everything that makes us up, and it contains a huge amount of information.
The result of this kind of work is simple but very powerful.
We've observed and compared to the three ginoms that were previously published in Guinea, we've been able to figure out that the outbreak began in Guinea months ago, first of all, after we've been infected with humans, and then we've transmitted the virus, and then we've spread.
This is very important to figure out how to intervene, but then it's contact tracing.
We've confirmed that the virus is mutating as it infects humans.
It's very important to observe each of these mutations, because diagnostic devices and vaccines, all of that, they're basically based on a genome sequence.
International health experts need to take action on this and re-adjust all the results they have achieved.
The first thing I did as a scientist was that I was accumulating data at hand, and then, for months and months, I was in the lab, I was in the lab, I was in the lab, I was in a careful, I carefully analysed the data, I published the research paper, I had several conversations, and when the paper was finally published, I published the data.
This is the current state of the way scientists do their research.
But you couldn't have done that, could you?
My friends were on the front lines, and what was very clear was that they needed help, and they needed a lot of help.
So the first thing I did was, after the genome array was read, and then I published it on my website.
But I just sent the data to the world as it was, and I said, "Please help me."
and the help came.
And quickly, I was surprised to see the data being published, and I got a call from people all over the world.
One of the best virus tracking teams in the world suddenly became one of our friends.
We started working virtually, and we started to do phone calls and emails, and we looked at how we could track the virus minute by minute and stop the spread of the disease.
There are many ways to build a community in such an emergency.
Especially when the outbreak began to spread on a global scale, everyone was actively researching, engaging, trying to help.
They all wanted to get involved.
The ability of people around the world is really great, and the Internet connects us all over the world.
Imagine, rather than seeing each other as a threat, and they're all like, "Let's do this."
and we're going to do this together.
The problem was that the data we all used was very limited and inadequate, only the ones we were searching on the internet.
And in that case, there's a lot of potential, and the opportunity is lost.
In the early days of the outbreak in Kenema, we had 106 medical records, and we decided to make them available all over the world.
And in our lab, we've been able to learn from these 106s on a computer, and we've been able to prove that we can predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with nearly one hundred percent accuracy, and we're going to be able to prove that we can do that to the medical professionals who work there.
I created an app to provide it, but it worked well enough, and in order to prove it.
There weren't enough of 106 of them, and we were waiting for more data to come before the release.
But the data didn't come.
Everyone was doing their research, thinking, and waiting, but they were all in the silo and didn't use the power of cooperation.
but this is not possible.
don't you think so? you all think so.
it's at our risk.
In fact, many lives have been lost, medical professionals, my five most important colleagues, Bar Hony, Alex Mogboy, Dr. Hummer Khan, Alice Koboma, and Mohamed Fuller.
They were five of the many medical people who died in and around Kenema, and the world was waiting, and we were silently working in pieces.
Ebola, like the threat to other humans, increases due to suspicion, discord.
When we build walls and fight each other, the virus grows stronger.
But unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola is equally relevant to all of us.
we're fighting together.
If someone gets Ebola, they might soon be infected by someone else.
Now we hope that we can work together with joy in a situation where we are equally vulnerable, have the same life force, we have the same fears and our hopes.
One of the graduate students who taught me read a book about Sierra Leone, and I learned that the name of the city, "Kenema," which is the name of the city where we work, actually means "clear like a river, and it's transparent in everyone's eyes."
And I felt a very deep sense of that, because even before we knew it, we always respected the people of Kenema, shared information in an open environment, and tried to work together.
that's important.
Because when an outbreak happens, we need to share information with ourselves and to everyone around us to fight it together.
This is not the first Ebola outbreak, nor is it the last time, and there are still many other microbes lurking, like the Lassa virus.
And the next time there's an outbreak, it could happen in a big city where millions of people live.
It could be an airborne virus.
It could be deliberately spreading the virus.
This is a very scary thing, of course, but at the same time, what this experience has taught us is that we have the technology and the ability to overcome them, and we have the ability to fight the virus, and we have the advantage.
But that will be possible as long as we work together, and with joy, we'll do it.
Dr. Khan, who died in the fight against infectious diseases, and the people who lost their lives on the front lines, they were fighting with us all the time, and we're going to fight this fight with them all the time.
Let's light up the world with the cooperation of billions of warm hearts and compassions to ensure that the world is not swayed by the destruction of a single virus.
thank you.
