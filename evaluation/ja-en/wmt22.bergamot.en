That’s why I don’t want to watch TV anymore...
I wonder if the comedian has become impossible? The TV is just an entertainer.
I watched Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but there were quite a lot of scenes where the staff laughed behind the scenes even when I said something that was not particularly interesting.
It's not a funny place, but it's not creepy to laugh at everything you say because you're a selling entertainer.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be damaged, and it may be bad for work.
Like the old black companies, that industry is like a sports association, and it seems that the ego of some comedians is too big and usually has a bad attitude, and if you do not do so, you will not be able to eat it.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of arguments for the comedians themselves to "lick comedians" with the feeling that they are full of the difficulties of their work.
I know that the income is quite low until I can sell it, but even if comedians are told to do it every time as if they are at the top of the top of the wrong job.
I can only hear the justification for the beautification of my own career and the fact that comedians are too expensive in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry where I work is also quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the entertainment industry are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry for complaining.
I felt that it was not good for my body if I did not go out like farts ...

The product ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without permission
Summary: When I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, I received a wired version of the mouse and told to return it if I wanted a refund.
It is a mail-order trouble rather than a topic of self-made PC, but it is not acceptable no matter how you think about it, and it is a famous place, so I will write here.
It was the beginning of the Tsukumo net shop's Tsukumo day sale that started on the previous Friday when MSI's wireless gaming mouse was sold for 3280yen (linked fish taku)
At the store, the wired version was the same price, so I ordered it considering the possibility of price mistakes and checking the wired version page 5,071yen (linked fishaku) because it was not a mistake
I received the order email successfully, and the next day I also received the shipping email
In these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written
Since there was no error notice or cancellation notice from the order to the shipment, I thought at this point when the wireless mouse I ordered arrived
A few hours after the shipment, I received an email saying that there was a mistake in registering the product.
According to the email,
* The wireless version was sold at sale special price, but it was actually a wired version
* Since we have already shipped the wired mouse,
1.Reject receipt and cancel all
2. Return only mouse and get a refund
3. Use a wired mouse as it is
Choose to deal with it.
The product page of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and it seems that it was sent without permission to replace the wired version even though it is written as a wireless version in the purchase history, e-mail, and delivery slip
If you send something different from the product you bought without understanding, and if you want it to be refunded, it is not terrible to send it back from here?
I want to fight back with a shot, even if I finally accept the refund, so please lend me your wisdom

The only bridge that leads to the district due to the typhoon and heavy rains is leaked Residents triple the stockpile of food <Fukushima Prefecture's Yasai Town> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto in the Takajihara area of Yasai Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The typhoon in eastern Japan had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "At first, it was like 'Really?'
The only road leading to the Kojihara area, the "Kajchihara Bridge", was swept away by the typhoon in eastern Japan, and thirty people from eleven families in the district became isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off the water continued to carry the necessary supplies using JR's iron bridge, which is usually not allowed to pass.
Mr. Yoshiro Matsumoto: "Normally, cars can come to the garden, but when I get out of the car there, I hold it in my hand, or I carry it on my back and walk over the iron bridge, so I felt the sense of transportation and car, so I felt the sense of transportation and the emergency bridge completed in less than three months, and it was washed away by heavy rain and became isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was washed away by heavy rain.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, but Matsumoto continues to take lessons from the lessons learned.
Mr. Koro Matsumoto: "I think there are about ten cases.
For the time being, I would like to make sure that I managed to secure 2-3 days."
Misako Matsumoto: "I don't know when a disaster will come down on me, not someone else's affairs, so I felt again that it was better to stockpile a little."
The town began its own initiative in 2021 to not forget the lessons learned.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Chief of the Education Division, Yasai Town, said, "We have made an announcement that we want to make it in the form of "Yasai Town Disaster Prevention Day" and that October 12th should be a day to think about disaster prevention preparedness after next year.
I think there has been an increase in awareness of the unexpected things that can happen.”

・Voices when waving weapons

Pay attention when buying a second home!
What are the pitfalls of the "building situation survey system" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
Toward the revitalization of the second-hand housing market The newly established "building situation survey" system The second-hand housing business is doing well.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also on an expanding trend.
While the coronavirus pandemic has increased the desire to own a home, the popularity of properties represented by the words "direction to fronts, stations, and adjacent to stations" that are soaring, such as "large-scale" and "towers", and the number of relatively cheap new properties has drastically decreased sharply.
[See image in this article] However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) housing distribution in Japan is still at a low level.
Therefore, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) revised the Act on Real Estate and Buildings Transaction Business, and launched a survey called "building situation survey" and so-called inspection (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/00121990.pdf) with the aim of trading safe and secure second-hand houses (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is familiar with housing checks the current situation, including the deterioration of the property, and the condition of the building, summarizes it in a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections has benefits for both buyers and sellers.
This is because the seller can avoid the claim after delivery by conducting a property survey before the sale transaction, which gives the buyer a sense of security.
This will also lead to the differentiation of competing properties.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that can grasp the state of the second-hand house planned to be purchased, and it is a system that can be purchased convincingly, and at first glance it is a system with great merit.
However, in the current system of the system, it is mainly the seller who has the initiative to conduct a survey of the building situation.
In addition, I would like to note that only the announcement of the system of inspection has become mandatory.
In other words, the real estate agent in charge of brokerage is obliged to explain that “I can introduce an architect who investigates the building situation when a property brokerage” or “I can not”, but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
On the other hand, if we turn to overseas, we will look at the second-hand market, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where the second-hand market is booming, similar systems have already been developed.
In the pre-house sale stage, the buyer asks an expert called the “inspector” or “building survey” to investigate the building.
For example, in the United States, inspections are conducted in 70 to 90 percent of second-hand home transactions, depending on the state.
The Japanese-style inspection of the main "seller" is very different in that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting inspections.
The seller tries to sell the building as well as possible, as high as possible, and as quickly as possible.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to live with peace of mind by examining the contents of the survey and making appropriate repairs.
Even with the same inspection, the purpose and thought of both sides are misaligned.
Therefore, the following risks to the Japanese system are pointed out as a worrying risk.
● The scope of investigation of the seller-led inspection system established by the government shall be minimal.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) who introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "inspection" will be carried out, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller

Was Ginza an island?
Five Miscellaneous Classes You Can Talk While Silver Braring (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
“This used to be a peninsula.
On that evidence... "It's only in Ginza that you can show a little miscellaneous learning.
I will introduce the trivia of Ginza that you will surely want to talk to someone who is interesting to know.
Go over Ginza ! ?
First infiltrate the gold seat
When you walk around Ginza, you can see the quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and many shrines, and the history of the Ginza area carved out everywhere.
When she and I walked around Ginza, I suddenly came to the silence, "This was a peninsula a long time ago.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
Ginza in Chuo-ku, Tokyo, is synonymous with the downtown area that created "○○ Ginza" in various parts of Japan.
In the first place, "Ginza" was a foundry of silver coins, and in the 1612s, the Ginza office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called 'Shinsen-makacho,' but when it moved to Kagera-guish-cho, it came to be called 'Ginza' by the common name.
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a " peninsula" that juts out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, from Hibiya to Marunouchi, inlets entered the inlet, and from Nihonbashi to Ginza, the peninsula called "Edomae Island" was growing.
The tip of the peninsula is the present Ginza.
When Ieyasu TOKUGAWA established the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in Edo, he reclaimed the inlet and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi area.
In addition, Ieyasu built a district and built a moat-warrior to develop a boat.
They cut off the soil and Mt. Kanda from the moat and filled the cove.
In front of Tiffany Ginza Main Store (Ginza 2-7, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of the "birthplace of Ginza" that shows the site of the Ginza office, so why not look for interested?
"Pilgrimage to the Holy Land" of Ginza known to those who know
In Ginza, "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour" is held every year, which is known only to those who know it.
Among the ten or more sacred places, the most likely to see is Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za Theater.
Many people visit the shrine on the right edge of the Kabuki-za Theater before and after the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is on the roof of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Success Jizo Son" is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", "Toyiwa Inari Shrine" are located in the back of the alley, and it is difficult to stand out, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known for reverence by Kabuki famous actor Uzaemon Ichimura, and "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance of the 1st floor is not open to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes a place that enshrines Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu, but most shrines enshrine Inari.
Inari-sha Shrine, where foxes welcome you in front of the main shrine building, was built in a lot of places where there are many farmers, as it is expected to benefit from 'five grain rich harvests' that are often ripped out of rice.
In large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said that it would benefit from business prosperity, and faith spread in Ginza, the most prosperous downtown area in Japan.

The pain in the knee, maybe osteoarthritis of the knee! ?
Different treatments for different causes (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editor: I've been having knee pain lately.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: The causes of knee joint pain can occur in various ways, such as injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, many Japanese people have osteoarthritis.
Editor: Does that mean the joints are deformed?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for the function of relieving shock and smoothing the movement of the joints.
However, due to aging, obesity, intense sports, etc., the cartilage may become worn out or distorted.
As a result, it leads to deformation and inflammation of the joints.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis develop in addition to the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers of the hand, the base, the neck, the hips, the thumb of the foot, etc.
However, the most common is the case that occurs in the knee, which is called "osteoarthritis of the knee".
Editor: In the first place, what is the structure of the joints?
MARUYAMA: The joints are a combination of two bones and unevenness.
And the part where these two books are facing is covered with "articular cartilage", and the surrounding area of the joint is wrapped with "articular wrap".
Editor: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Mr. Maruyama: That's right.
In the inner layer of the joint wrap, there is a tissue called a synovial membrane, which makes the joint fluid.
This articulated fluid acts as a lubricant and consists of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfuric acid.
That is why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfuric acid are good for smoothing the movement of the knee.
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Maruyama: Articular cartilage has a viscous and elastic function to prevent bones from directly infecting bones.
In other words, it is a role like a cushion.
However, if this is worn out or distorted, it can deform or inflame the joints, causing pain.
Do you have pyjamas when you go to sleep?

Three "Kayji" series of gambling and games that you can actually experience (real sound) - Yahoo! News
The "Kayji" series is a gambling manga that boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the best parts of this game is the extreme game that risked its lives.
[Photo] Just looking at the foot is scooping ... ... Challenge to cross the steel frame!
So this time, I would like to verify the game of Kaiji that can actually be played or practiced in the planning video.
■Numa It is a pachinko "numa" full of traps that appeared in "gambling breaking precepts Kaiji".
In the original story, Kaiji was surprised by the high rate of 4000yen per ball.
In this "numa", there were large traps of "nail forest", "movable objects" and "three-stage croon", and it was considered almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used all kinds of hands, and finally put a plastic water tank in the building and went out to the rough business of sinking the ground and tilting it, and it was captured wonderfully.
"Numa" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko, and many people are playing it.
Of course, there is no such thing as "one ball 4000yen", and the difficulty is reduced, but you will be able to taste the feeling of Kaiji.
At the "Starside Party" held by the rich as entertainment, it was the steel-frame crossing of "human horse racing" that was carried out to debtors including Kaiji.
The debtor competes for speed by devising ways not to fall on a thin steel frame set up ten meters above the ground.
Twelve people participated, and the top two can win the prize, but there are only four steelframes, and the safety measures are insufficient, and the possibility of death is quite high.
This steel-frame crossing is dangerous, but it was deployed as a VR game, and you can have a very close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" installed in "Rakuten Life Park Miyagi", the home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge is a steel bridge at the 20m high (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and "Sky Blanco" and "Victory Ippon Bridge" are prepared at the end, and you are walking to the Eagle Bridge.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koara has released a video of him walking on the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube, saying, "You can experience steel-framed crossing in Japan."
E-card E-Cards E-Cards, a two-player card game.
Use a single card of the emperor, eight cards of citizens, and ten cards of a slave, and play on the emperor's side and the slave side.
This game is very well made, and the emperor is strong against the citizens, the citizens are strong against the slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
Kaiji fights Tonegawa with the strict rule that "if you lose, you can cut your own ears if you lose."
Kaiji realized that the device that destroys the ear, such as earphones attached to the ear, is read psychologically by sensing and transmitting changes in the pulse and body temperature, etc., and he confused the Tone River by scraping his own ears to the limit and making his body abnormal value, and won.
E-cards are on the market and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru played the role of Kaiji in the movie and uploaded a video of him playing an E-card match with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, and it attracted a lot of attention.
■Is there anything you can do to taste the Kaiji mood?
It is something that no one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji, but it is also true that when you read manga, you will feel as much as you feel.
How about feeling the world view through the game?
A step toward the new year, gently boosted by Tora's big ema at Gokoku Shrine in the prefecture|Yamagata Shimbun
At Gokoku-jinja Shrine (Yamagata City) in Yamagata Prefecture, where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema (horseback archery) of the zodiac sign of the year, 'Tora' appeared next year.
On the 11th, students of Tohoku University of Arts and Technology who designed it visited the shrine and held a public offering in front of the gods.
Since the previous year, the shrine has been asking students to paint the original drawings of ema (Japanese-style ema).
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was selected from among nine people in the Japanese painting course of the art department taught by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3m wide and the center is about 1.8m high.
Tsuchiya drew it with "the image that the cherry blossoms gently push the back as they step into the new year".
The tiger stands and looks at the cherry blossoms, with the hope that "even in a world that changes violently, you can have a margin to admire the beauty of nature."
The design of Tsuchiya is also depicted on the ema (votive horse) that is generally distributed.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people to overcome difficulties."

"Tamano who wants to continue to live" Let's think about the proposal Four high school students in the city workshop: Sanyo Shimbun Digital|San Deji
What kind of town is Tamano in the 2030s?
A student representative of four high schools in Tamano City is working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano who wants to continue to live there."
As part of the Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center, an interim support organization, the Tamano SDGs Miraizukuri Center, the report is a part of the survey and policy proposal project, and the voices of young people are summarized and made recommendations to the mayor and others.
“When is it fun?”
In response to the facilitator's question, the student answers questions such as "When you get excited with many people" and "When you're playing drums."
The first meeting was held at the Hinode Fureai Kaikan on November 13th.
Eighteen high school students and local people in the area discussed "an interesting town", "a town that is easy to live in", and "a town where people feel the purpose of life" using the method of "World Cafe" where the theme is decided while moving "island" where each theme is decided.
Write down each idea on a sticky note and put it on imitation paper to organize it.
“It seems interesting to live in a town with many young people” “Transportation such as trains and buses is indispensable for livability.”
We will discuss whether they have anything in common or not.
“I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle on the seaside is attractive,” said a third-year student at Tamano Shoko High School, 18.
A third-year student at Binan High School, 18, said, "There are few shops, transportation is inconvenient, but nature is rich, but it is good to have a place rich in nature."
In December, only high school students gathered for the second time, and the contents of the proposal were organized.
The mayor and the head of education are scheduled to be invited to make a presentation in February next year.
"We hope that it will foster a love of the hometown of high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to actively engage in community development," said Rie Higashi, president of the center.

How to find Stol's new way (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
It is an indispensable stall in winter, but there are times when the cloth is stuck at the neck.
After winding, you can adjust the balance while looking in the mirror, but sometimes you hear that you do not understand the trick.
If I had a stole that could be rolled quickly without a cloth, I found something novel.
The stall of the brand "COTORI" is more compact than the general one with a long side of about one meter.
When I first saw it, I was like, "Is it so short and can be rolled up?"
If you look closely, you can see that the thin, long-cut cloth is knitted into one piece, and the whole is in the shape of the net.
In the net, the edge of the stall can be passed through.
Therefore, you can wrap and fasten it without connecting the edges and edges.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, the gilet (best) without sleeves is popular even in jackets, but many people will wear it in combination with a stole so that the shoulders do not get cold.
I think it would be helpful to have such a stall.

It was directed by Peter Jackson called Get Buck.
It feels like a raw or life-sized Beatles, and it is fresh ...
I'm doing Gisgis because it's just before the break-up, but it's not a dramatic gigis like I imagined
While doing my best and managing, "I know that I'm annoying, but let's go!", such as a troublesome pole like, "But, ~" is a linger, George who is a linger, and while calmly saying opinions and jokes, he is not motivated to be late John ... The apple of the lazy role does not actively interswine, and sitting on the face with "troublesome" in the back etc.
There is a feeling that there is a very much feeling in the air of "Well, it is impossible to work together anymore"It is interesting that the Beatles were like that, it is interesting that the Beatles were like that, such as the dismantling of the legend, etc.
And when you start playing in such an air, everyone is really full of talent
From a little phrase to each other, "How about this?" While doing it, the process of finishing "that masterpiece" is bad
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing
The hana song like a casual hunchun gradually becomes that zucha ♪ Zcha ♪ The scene where the lyrics are entered is firmly recorded and it is amazing
It is amazing that the process of composing can be seen like this
Also, it is natural, but everyone is fat riding, so you can be happy just by watching the playing scene
It seems that it is still one of the three episodes, but for now the biggest cause of dissolution was the impression that it was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves
The four of them will be fun if they start making songs while complaining somehow, but when it comes to talking about the place of the live, producers and advertising people say, "After all, the Beatles are from the world's best!"
Well, the documentary also has the director's interpretation, so Peter Jackson may have felt that way ...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising, so I thought that it may be because there are many scenes that Paul is rather bad and bad

Unseasonal warmth and strong cold air effects of frequent tornadoes in the United States (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, there were many tornadoes mainly in the southern United States.
At this time of year, the condition of the atmosphere became very unstable due to the influence of strong cold air down south where it was recordly warm, and it seems that cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed from the southwest into the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on the 9th (Thursday) and 10th (Friday) local time has risen to around 30C.
In the place where such a record warmth was, a strong cold air of -30°C or less was moving southward around 5500m above, so an active front was formed due to a large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds developed rapidly in a way that was in line with the front.
It is believed that there were a series of tornadoes in the vicinity.
The southern part of the United States is originally an area prone to to tornadoes, but from early summer to summer is high season, and there are not many cases of major damage at this time of year.
The tornado warning, which was issued in a single day during the winter season, reached nearly 150 times, a record number of cases.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than four hundred tornadoes and gusty winds on Friday, local time alone.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which shows the strength of a tornado, reached the EF3, the third from the strongest of the six stages, and it is thought that a gust of wind blew around 70m/s at a moment.
Depending on the future investigation, it may be judged as EF4 to EF5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese version improved Fujita scale) is used based on the improved Fujita scale according to the situation of Japanese buildings.
JEF3, which is equivalent to the American tornado, is likely to occur in Japan, and it is at the level where wooden houses collapse.

U.S. tornado "the largest in history" from under the rubble, there are also voices asking for help in the live broadcast (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
On the damage caused by tornadoes in the Midwest and Southern United States, President Biden said on Monday that it was “one of the largest tornadoes in U.S. history.”
This was reported by CNN television.
Biden stressed that "as a federal government we will do everything."
“We still don’t know how many lives were lost,” he said.
The death toll feared more than a hundred people.
Photo: Residents in Kentucky, which was hit by a tornado, carrying household goods and other items from a broken house to a person carrying household goods and other items, more than thirty tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky, from the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th.
CNN's weather experts estimate that this time was the largest of the 250mph.
In Mayfield, Kentucky, a candle factory that had been in operation around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
There were 110 people on duty at the time, but the building was destroyed and there were no traces.
In the dark, a woman who was stuck under a piece of rubble about one or five meters thick felt the weight of rescue workers searching over the rubble and asked for help via a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone.
In the live broadcast, in addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the singing voice of "Happy Birthday to You", which seems to be sung while crying to dispel the screams and another woman's fear was also heard.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk living in Mayfield, was safely in hiding in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people like the sound of the train, but it was a terrible sound like the sound of the ground sound like something more erupted," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police officer said: "We will continue the search operation until it is no longer necessary.
I don’t know if it will be weeks, months, or years,” he said.
In Illinois, a warehouse of the Internet retailer Amazon collapsed, killing at least six people.
The train's trains are derailed due to shocks such as being cut off, and highways are also being closed off due to the impact of the overturning of the train.
According to the U.S., about four hundred thousand homes in Tennessee have been without power.
I have few platelets.
What can I do to make more?
Take high-protein foods and drinks
Avoid coarsely raw vegetables.
You should do something.

It is a long-standing discourse that the way of thinking about the evaluation system of the star system is different.
Foreign countries will deduct points from there based on five stars, while Japan will add three stars as neutral points and deduct points.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of two stars, and the four stars have a completely different meaning between "there is a point reduction element" and "not a masterpiece, but a good work".
If you set it to five stars, "works that only have no shortcomings" and "highest level of work in everything" will be the same, so if there is such a tendency, I think that it would be a system defect that does not show the meaning of stars, but I said that I would like you not to add three stars (notoriety) because such a system is currently operated in such a system.
Therefore, if you try to argue with those who advocate this kind of discourse with Steam's two-choice evaluation, the story will not get in touch with you.

<Saga-eating notes> "Hakobune" "Sealy seasonal fish fried and shrimp fried fish caught in the near sea Homemade tartare sauce"|Life and Culture|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunch box "Seasonal fish fried and shrimp fried fish caught in the near sea, homemade tartare sauce"
"hakobune" is a colorful bento box box made with plenty of vegetables and a take-out specialty store for deli (side dishes).
Takayuki Kazuki, 39, and Arimi, 38, opened their restaurant in August last year.
One of the popular bento menus is "Seasonal fish fried and shrimp fried fish caught in the nearby sea, homemade tartare sauce" (1000yen).
Fish choose the good ones at the market at the time.
"Fry is made as thin as possible with raw breadcrumbs so that you can understand the texture of the material," says Takayuki, and you can directly see the plump texture of the fried shrimp.
There are about four kinds of vegetables and deli assorted vegetables and deli, and rice and soup with millet are added to the rice divided by shihihikari from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are purchased homemade in the soba field and at direct sales in the prefecture.
Side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki has trained in French, and rappe and laattoyuyu add color.
On the other hand, it is a blend of Japanese and Western styles that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, with "a relaxing taste that you are used to eating" like dashi rolled eggs (Mr. Arimi).
The lunch box "Handmade hamburger of domestic meat" (1000yen) is also popular.
From next year, we will also release a processed meat product "Charcuterie Set" that goes well with sake such as wine.

There was something interesting at Haneda Airport that happened to stop by, so I tried it.
Ride comfort Not so bad, but sometimes shakes (not enough to get drunk)
Fast, of course, slow.
Safety If there are people around, the speed is slowed down, and in some cases it stopped completely, so I think it is safe, but I thought it was dangerous depending on the place
Eyes around Pain, it is good to be seen, but it is a pain of the heart to be seen like "It's a hindrance"
Overall review Not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It is a pity that it is easy to use if there are a few fewer people or consideration such as getting close to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to make a dedicated lane so that it does not get in the way of other people walking
However, there are also relaxing, and I thought that it was a good vehicle if there were few people a little more because you can relax while watching the scenery
It was a difficult vehicle unless you have a fairly patient mind, the excitement of the near future feeling that such autonomous driving will become the mainstream in the future and the pain of the surrounding eyes are comfortable,
Damn, I was embarrassed.

If you look closely, you may know a little, but eel does not use any eel.
Actually, it is "! eggplant!"! (If you tap it, it will come out correctly)
I like eel, but I thought that the eel part is something other than the actual baking just because everyone is eating it with the sauce ...I thought that the texture and quantity of eel are important.
I didn't want the eel to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.

The man who ran away was skinheaded with medium meat.
A knife believed to have been used for the crime was left near the scene.
The man said he was drinking with several acquaintances, and is investigating as if there was some traffic trouble between the pedestrian man and the man on the motorcycle.

A long family that has taken root in environmental protection activities on the frontier of China (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Hong Kong company Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China, which has a large land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, and the type of mammals inhabits is the world's largest, and the world's third-class species of plant.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity, and in some regions, they are promoting not only environmental protection but also environmental activist activities.
Located in southern China, Yunnan Province, Shezpanna, located in southern China, is one such area.
Sisapanna is a region that shares a border with Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the Thai people who share their roots with the Thai people of Thailand.
The origin of the Mekong River flows through Southeast Asian countries.
The area of the Sisapanna Tayian Autonomous Region is only 0.2% of the entire population of China, but there are about twenty-five percent of the wild animals and twenty percent of the plants.
This time, Mr. Li Jie, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, met on the site and told us about the contents of the activities.
I started environmental protection activities with my German husband ――I heard that it has been twenty years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the trigger like that?
Mr. Lee Our environmental protection activity "Tengu" has been active since the 2000s.
This is my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisappanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
It is the only tropical rainforest region in China and boasts one of the most diverse areas of biodiversity.
On the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
Therefore, in order to bring industry to the region, large-scale deforestation of the rainforest was previously advanced in order to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
My husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
I was a journalist and got married here.
Was Lee not interested in nature conservation before that?
Mr. Lee I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of the rainforest or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though they are not in a position or are not particularly tall, but why do you think?
A popular actor said.
Aura is not something you want to get out of.
It is something that comes out naturally at the moment when you have confidence in yourself.

[Oma ring / personal memorization] It is the cause of CDD in the MOD self-centered environment, and it took about a month and a half to identify
CDD due to multiple factors occurred while stable data from around GW until March did not have much time to play from around GW, and it took a very long time to identify it.
Why didn't you analyze the log in the .Net Script Framework (and you'll know in a few minutes)?Some of the errors in the .dll series and mesh-related relationships are not in the crash log.
〇Major timing of CDD
* Leave no footprints on all papyrus, .Net Script Framework, or log-out .dll plug-ins logs.
* Some NPC killings / attacks cumulative time: Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in / powerofthree's SE update resume version) is improved with OFF * Is there a possibility of false accusations about this?
* Basic improvement by OFF by OFF by .ini: setting competition in DAR + Nemesis related? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached the limit or the DAR animation number has reached 10,000
* (basic outdoor) During field movement + some magic (e.g., iced runes) activated, NPC hit: Dirt & Blood v 2.0 SPOD use NPC application setting (top right corner of MCM) All are OFF and all improved with five consecutive attempts.
Is it due to a misconfiguration of the shader setting of some additional armor / NPC wearing armor and body mesh? In addition, 2.0 SPIRD usage default.ini has a format error, but as a result, it is the intended result and the premise Perk should be applied to NPC.
At first, I focused on checking the part attack and the movement / combat mod (.dll stuff) related to the onhit, but it turned out like this.
I don't think there were similar bug reports at the English, German or French level at least.
If there is a person who has a similar CDD problem in the Japanese environment, I thought that it might be a reference as a reminder, so I posted it.

What to think about the importance of psychiatry home-visit nursing--to-home nursing is over today
Since I suffer from bipolar disorder, I have been receiving visiting nurses for a long time, but I think that I have a long relationship with the nurse (female) of the visiting nursing station I am currently using, and I think that I am building a very good relationship.
We talk a lot every week.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (such as a package), but above all, I thought that today's visiting nursing care is how important it is for people with mental illness.
Today, I also discussed the clutter about the gender difference between men and women, or gender theory, and laughed.
I also talk about the sexual desire of men and women, why she divorced, and how can I be a visiting nurse?
Sometimes, though, I dress as a woman.
However, in the case of a visiting nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, I heard from an acquaintance that an aunt nurse who could no longer work in the ward came and only did not respond to the office, or that an occupational therapist was coming to the visiting nursing school, and instructed from the top, saying, "This is because we are doing medical care."
I am using a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, but I think she is a really good nurse who confronts Frank on an equal basis with me with mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful and laughs.
Some of you may be receiving a psychiatric home-visit nurse, and some of you are thinking about receiving it.
Visiting nurses are very helpful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor approves, I will accept it.
Choose a good visiting nurse station.
In the past, I was not at warped, and there were places where I canceled the contract from here.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents, one-fifth of China's "destroyed to implement the hydrogen economic roadmap" - Yahoo! News
The South Korean government announced its hydrogen economic roadmap for 2019.
It was said to be the plan to expand the use of sixty-five thousand fuel cell vehicles by 2022 and operate three hundred and thirty hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6000won (about 577yen) per kilo.
However, by November this year, fuel cell vehicles are only 27 percent of the target.
The hydrogen station price per kilometre is also not much different from the time of the roadmap announcement.
It was found that the government's implementation of the hydrogen economic roadmap is well below the target.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Economic and Economic Federation (Zenkeiren) released a report "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economy Ecosystem".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry depend on the United States, Japan, and other countries.
Carbon fiber, the core material of fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), KYOCERA (Japan) for platinum catalysts, DuPont (U.S.), Gore (U.S.), and 3M (U.S.) for membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries leading the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) is increasing on average by 14% per year (since 2014).
South Korea is the world's fifth in terms of the number of patents in the hydrogen production and fuel cell fields (cumulatively in 2014-2020).
However, the Zenkeiren said, “In effect, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that it is the lowest among the competitive countries.”
The country-by-counter patent rankings are in order of China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the U.S. to take first place, widening the gap.
The number of patents registered in 2020 was fourth, surpassing Japan's (974 cases) in Korea with 1033 cases, but it is at the 22% level of China (4721 cases).
Zenkeiren proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax credit for capital investment and research and development costs.

Congress on Sunday?
, Making flyers like TV programs In Takasu, parliamentary reform is underway, and the "communication book" of legislators is also: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic version
[Takasu] The town council is working on unique parliamentary reforms, such as creating quirky flyers to guide the holding of regular meetings and introducing "communications books" that the townspeople evaluate the legislators.
The town council election is held for the third consecutive term without a vote, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
In order to disseminate the Sunday assembly held on the 12th, about 1800 leaflets of the new work were distributed in newspaper folding on the 9th.
"Morning Raw Guiron" "Tetsuko's Room" "Sawaguchi Jin Exploration Series" ... .
The flyer distributed to the entire house by the town council on the 9th is a word reminiscent of the name of a popular TV program.
Mr. Hyoe Katayama, 43, who created the project, said, "I want you to laugh and go to the parliament."

U.S., aid weapons and ammunition arrive in Ukraine, also engaged in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) -- A U.S. State Department official reported that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday, based on a security aid program approved by President Biden.
At the beginning of the year, the last equipment, including four radars that identify the launch site of mortars, will be transported to Ukraine.
According to Pentagon spokesman Kirby, these aids included deadly weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The purpose of the military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the military buildup that the Russian army is promoting around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. is wary of Russian forces, and has consulted with NATO members to develop measures to deal with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved weapons aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st.
U.S. military assistance to Ukraine reached a total of $450 million this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, the total amount of aid has risen to more than $25bn.
The U.S. military is also engaged in training missions for Ukrainian forces.
Last month, it dispatched a National Guard in Florida in accordance with a multilateral joint drill program to support Ukraine.
According to a Pentagon statement, the European U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been revealed as a secret to the operation.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, but there were also tense exchanges in the situation in Ukraine.
The U.S. is also prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The future of inheritance and gift tax "review" that makes the lifetime gift "forbidden hand", direct hit to Akira Amari and the former tax chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of LDP!
The first feature of the December 18th issue of "Weekly Diamond" is "Talking to the family at the end of the year!
It is a lifetime gift and inheritance.”
As the discussion progressed between inheritance tax and gift tax, it was postponed in the 2022 tax revision outline that was a concern, but in the near future, there is a great possibility that lifetime gifts, which are the royal road of inheritance tax measures, will become "banned".
How will the inheritance rules change?
Along with a direct hit to the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and a member of the House of Representatives, I will teach you everything from the basic gift of gifts and inheritance basics to tax-saving techniques for gifts and gifts for the year-round gifts in time for the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Hiroaki Miyahara)
From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax with a more integrated view of inheritance tax and gift tax, we will proceed with full-scale consideration to the construction of a tax system that is neutral to the selection of the timing of asset transfers.
The ruling party announced last year that a draft of the tax reform outline for FY2021 was widely shaken not only by wealthy people but also by the middle class.
This is because what you want to say means that you will change the rules of inheritance and try to raise the inheritance tax by making the "lifetime gift" that is the royal road of inheritance tax measures as "banned".
The iron rule of highly progressive inheritance tax tax measures is to "reduce taxable assets."
The most powerful trump card, lifetime gifts, have been widely used not only by wealthy people, but also by company employees who have homes in the three major metropolitan areas, and who incur inheritance tax even though they are small.
The discussion of "inheritance tax and gift tax" that came down in such a situation.
Although the 22nd fiscal year tax revision outline announced on December 10th, which was announced on December 10th, the policy for integration was announced with more in-depth words was announced, such as “review the current inheritance settlement taxation system and the calendar year gift system” and “the tax-free measure of gift tax is a system that does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets in the family within the limit within the limit (...) We will constantly review it.”
Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP's tax investigation, said in an interview with the editorial board.
"The most important thing is to lose the advantage and disadvantage depending on the time of the transfer of property, and to make the tax burden the same no matter when you go.
At present, we are currently simulating what problems will arise (by integration)." If the fastest revision is the fastest revision, there are three remaining opportunities for lifetime gifts remaining.
Even if it is not, there is no doubt that in the near future, there is no doubt that it will be greatly damaged in the direction of invalidating the lifetime gift as a tax saving measure.
How exactly will the inheritance and gift tax rules change?

Yudai Furukawa, terrestrial broadcaster from January 10th, 2022, "Please look forward to it!"
The original FOD drama starring Yudai Furukawa, "My Righteous Big Brother" will be broadcasted on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10th.
[Photo] Hanazumi Yamatani as the heroine This work is based on the manga of the same name by Moriesatoshi, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE · LOVE" since 2018, and is a love story of a man and a woman who carry the past.
The main character, Kairi, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, is played by Hanazumi YAMATANI.
Riyo, a university student, meets a senior at a part-time job, Kairi.
Haili, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly if he borrows the shoulders of Riko for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who has a resemblance to her brother, who died apart due to her parents' divorce, but for some reason, Kairi is a murderer, isn't it?
Yudai Furukawa's comment The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial broadcasting from January 10th!
Those who could not see it at FOD should look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will know the progress, and if you can see the complicated psychological description of Kairi and Riyo, and the state of the two people who are struggling and changing, I think that you can know this work more deeply.
I hope the fans of the original will enjoy it too.
Please look forward to it!

The team that won three games pass How the players felt (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this match, Jones threw a pass-path-pituitary pass only three times.
This was the lowest number of passes in the NFL in the past fifty years since the two passes that the Bills recorded against the New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
In the 1974 Bills, there was a RB, an inconcuous genius RB named O.J. Simpson, who exceeded 2000 yards a season for the first time in history in the previous season.
The Bills overpowered the Jets with Simpson and another RB Jim Braxton run.
The biggest reason why the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the border with Canada, and in terms of latitude, it is the same as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around one degree Celsius, the wind was blustery with a wind speed of 18m, and it was a blizzard before the game.
The Bills were local and didn't change much of their play choices.
He scored thirty passes on twenty-five runs.
Allen's pass is 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception and it was never undefeated.
He scored four red zone innings in the 10-off series.
In particular, after the end of the 3rd Q, I advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, I was able to take only three points of FG one time in those three times.
Defensive in front of the goal at the end of the game.
The Bills, who trailed by four points, committed a penalty in the 3rd & 9th and became 3rd & 14th.
Eighteen yards to the goal.
In the 3rd & 14th, QB Allen, surrounded by the Patriots defensive rush, flowed out of his pocket to the right.
He then threw a pass at the end zone TE Dawson Knox, but failed.
In this play, ace WR Stepon Diggs, who was outside right, ran the Charo-Across and was free in front of the end zone, but it did not seem to be in Allen's eyes.
On the 4th & 18th, Allen aimed at WR Gabriel Davis, who ran from left to left and outside into the end zone, but the pass failed after being hit by DB Miles Bryant of the Patriots in the foreground.
Bryant had a one-on-one cover of Bills' WR Cole Beasley, but when he saw Allen's move along the way, he let Beasley off and reacted to his pass.
Allen, who missed the two receivers, threw a pass to the end zone on both times.
The 4th down pass may have been a decisive decision, but the 3rd down did not need to aim for a TD.
You have to take the first down in two plays.
Since it was still in front of two minutes, if it was 4th & short, Allen's ability to own his own run should have lived.
Keep it together and with your hair.

Three items that tend to be placed in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
No matter how often you change it, it is probably the sponge that does not change as often as it is recommended.
According to a study last year, even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, many bacteria can grow (it is still recommended to sterilize them in a microwave).
The German researchers who did the study recommend replacing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says cutting boards should be replaced if they start to scrape off and scratched or grooved.
Once the scars and grooves progress, it becomes difficult to keep them clean, and bacteria grow.
If it is still okay, do not forget to disinfect one gallon of water frequently with a solution of unscented liquid bleach with a tablespoon dissolved solution.
Immerse the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and place a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water, dry it naturally or lightly with a clean paper towel to dry it.
Missing or broken tableware
Disposing of your favorite mugs may be heartbreaking, but the missing surface becomes a new hotbed for bacteria and germs.
It also causes the lip to be cut off in the missing part or the drink to spill out.
Yes, this is your chance to buy a new and favorite mug!

FlashBIOS does not end, help
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X, so I replaced it with the B550 I bought in September and Tomaho.
I went to the BIOS settings screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the black screen became a white cursor-like point that did not blink and it became received for a long time
Even if you try to rewrite it using FlashBIOS thinking that the BIOS is damaged, it does not end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it will be over in about five minutes, but it will not end in an hour.
The possible cause is that the USB memory I tried is too old and the one who converts and uses the SD card.

It has nothing to do with Gaijin.
You have to say it early, “Why am I just calling you out and saying, ‘Why am I just calling you out and talking to you?’”
So it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner? When it comes to saying, it's better to say that it's simply uncomfortable.
I don't even dream of being uncomfortable with a good chance.
I was living abroad on the way, but I had misunderstood that I could say anything to the locals if there were people who came to the top and bottom Confucian customs, including me, because there were some people who came to the top and bottom Confucian customs, including me, and the taga was out of the way.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you are doing it with a kind of a kind of sweet feeling without pure malice.

Well, it's still good if you're a friend.
The original may be purely normal, but if you ignore it, it may not stop the exceptional treatment of gaijin, so it is better to say it now.
Because it is Japan, can you talk about Japanese rules?
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my white friends who are naturalized always raise their glasses higher than the other younger when they toast at a drinking party.
I'm definitely aware of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do that, you can treat it like a Japanese, so you can treat it like a Japanese, whether you are younger or older.
Japanese people (including me) are watching such details regardless of their personality.

I am very happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, there were twenty-five subscribers as of yesterday, so I thought it would take a little longer until fifty people went, but for some reason, twenty-five people subscribed only today, so I am very grateful.
I would appreciate it if you could tell me where you learned this sabre in the comments section because you subscribed to this sabre today! (I am very interested because I do not know)

I often see this level of translation in games made overseas, and I feel that if it is a small company, it is well translated.
I think that it is possible for non-native Japanese speakers to understand the difference in the nuances of Japanese.
I don't know what level you are looking for, but if Japanese people are looking for a level that does not feel uncomfortable, it seems that it is good to look for someone else.

Thought "The blade of demon destruction" training is the battle.
"Equivalent exchange of effort" is a human hymn <Anime "Yukaku Edition" Start Commemoration> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent boys' comics, "The Blade of Extinction" is particularly alien to say, "There are many trainings."
It is established that there are no battles in general, and that the training part, which trains both at dawn or after night, is not popular with readers.
Even in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", there was two years of training when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, but you should know that the rest was skipping out by drawing only the touch.
Well, one of the charms of the eccentricity of the migratory land is that "training in the same place" may not be so compatible.
Now, the training of the main character of "The Blade of Extinction", the training of Sumijiro, the main character of "The Blade of Extinction", sat down in the land with Yoshitomo Tomioka who saved his life, and when he tried to take his own life, he said, "Don't let others take the right to kill and steal! You can say that it started with what I was told by the volunteers.
The weak have no rights and no choice, only to be screwed down by the strong with all their strength ... ... .
While saying that, Yoshikazu's kindness introduced Sakonji SAKATAKI, a "Ikute" who trains those who want to enlist in the Oni Satsutai (a bad person who does not explain the intention).
The first contact between Sumijiro and Scaletaki is asked, "What will you do when your sister eats a person?" and a strike is said to Sumijiro, who is full of answers, "Judgment is slow."
Even among the fans, it is an unreasonable exchange at first glance.
However, there is a possibility that the moment when such a decision is forced to come to the moment when he has to take his sister who has become an ogre.
It can be said that it is an initiation that enters the training from the posture.
However, the scavenger waterfall that takes the amateur Sumijiro, who has not yet trained, to Mt. Sagiri, and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain is full of traps, traps, stone throwers, and traps on the mountain on top of thin air, and it is about to die before entering training.
Even so, it is barely a "hero correction" to smell the faint smell of the traps made by human hands with the sharp sense of smell that he has, and to somehow avoid it.
And yet, "That's why I'm not suddenly physically capable enough to suddenly be able to avoid it all! What Sumijiro says is the essence of the demonic destruction.
Ordinary people do not suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening will only allow them to use "the power and skills that have been refined so far" with their original potential.
For those who have made an effort, "Equivalent exchange of effort" that rewards those who have made an effort, and does not reward nothing for the effort that probably does not reward, is a human hymn that is different from an ogre with unfounded supernatural power, and it is a difficult rule that is consistent with this work.

Twenty-four Aichi cars collide Trailer driver is not sick Careless (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
Twenty-four cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, and it was found that the driver of the trailer who was arrested and sent was not sick and seems to have caused the accident due to some carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, twenty-four cars, including trucks and passenger cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and twelve people were lightly injured.
Police arrested 54-year-old Katsuya Nomura, who was driving the trailer, on charges of causing injuries to a 71-year-old man after a rear-end crash, and sent him to prison on the morning of the 12th.
The trailer for Nomura continued to move forward without stepping on the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that Nomura lost consciousness for a while immediately after the accident.
However, according to the investigators, Nomura did not have a chronic illness and it was found that it was caused by some carelessness.
Police are searching the homes of the people involved and are closely examining the situation at the time.

Oginuma X's Kinnikuman Review [Comics 4th Volume] (Weekly Pre-NEWS) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started with three volumes, are completed in this four volumes!
In contrast to the previous volume that drew from the opening to the semifinal game at once, it is full of new devices because the focus was focused only on one game!
●"Kinnikuman" 4th volume review author name Oginuma X★★★★★★★★(five out of five stars) ●Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started before the game!
In a word, this four volumes are a book that carefully and carefully depicts the final match of Kinnikuman vs. Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that it is not a volume that depicts only matches on the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, it is difficult to go to the game, such as the battle to restrain each other and the special training scene, but it is not boring.
This feeling in the work that the tension of the battle of the century is gradually increasing, which is surely connected to the increase in the tension of the reader, and I am impressed that even this period is a really calculated production.
And before the important final, another mountain, not to be missed is the third place decision game of the terryman vs ramen man.
In addition to the luxury as a match card, I like what ramen man behind the scenes before the game pointed to the poster of Kinnikuman "From now on, it's my turn to aim!"
And try to beat the chops.
However, the scene where Terryman, who happened to pass by, accepts the sword and stops it, and stares at each other without saying a word, and the place just part breaks up.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been defeated, and there are no more opportunities to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is such a long-come-satisfaction about the Kinnikuman.
If you can see this, you can't help but think about the success of the distant future!
As a manga artist, this is what makes me feel this way, and this is the act that still makes me keenly aware of!
The battle between the two ends without much time off, but the famous scene is the appeal of the tears of the ramen man after the game.
To Kinnikuman, “Don’t be limited to the strength of God’s luck!”
It is a line.
This is already a grand meta-deprehensible to the work itself, I think that the reader has felt that Kinnikuman is the main character after all, so he is not losing, and he is somehow winning in a place where he is not capable.
However, by letting the ramen man make this remark, Mr. Boiled Tamago is ahead of himself and stabbed his hand to the cloud that he can no longer use his hands.
In this one word, the reader said, "Well, then, Kinnikuman will defeat Robin with his ability?
How?" "
From another writer's point of view, this is the same line that the boiled egg teacher who makes the work imposed on himself.
I thought this was a great thing to do.
I think it’s definitely one of the big points of this series.

Winter Illumination Weekend Takahama Town Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
At Aobayama Habar Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illuminations have begun, and the park is wrapped in gentle light.

On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which consists of municipalities in the Okitama area and JA, conducted PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce" to sell products while distributing videos on the Internet.
A group of military commanders from Yamagata Ai made a remote appearance on the "National Cooperation MINATO Market TV" planned for the first time in Minato-ku, Tokyo, and delivered the charm of the region along with specialty products.

3.) without activation.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp is attached to the power lamp for a moment, and the fan also moves, but it stops immediately.
After that, I won't say much.
I pull out the power plug and try again, but it still works for a moment.
4.) Connect the motherboard with ATX20 pin, 4 pins, and remove the other parts and try it out, but it does not start.
5.) I suspect that PSU is the cause because it seems that PSU fans have been hitting something for a long time, and there was a sound that sounded like a bubba bub bab bub bab bab bab bab bab bab bab bab bab bab bab b
I will try to find the remaining ATX power supply later and try it.
