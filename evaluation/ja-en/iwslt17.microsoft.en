It's about how we get knowledge.
The protagonist of the story is this woman Natalia Rybczynsky
He is a paleontologist who specializes in digging up ancient carcasses.
Natalia Rybczynsky: I used to call people "Dr. Carcass"
Latif Nasser: I found it particularly interesting because the excavation site is in the remote Canadian tundra, far north of the Arctic Circle.
One day in the summer of 2006, she was at an excavation site called File's Reef Bed that was less than 10 degrees latitude to the magnetic North Pole.
Natalia: You might think it's boring, because you're just walking around all day with a backpack, a GPS and a notebook, picking up what looks like fossils.
Latief: At one point, she realized something.
Natalia: Old, reddish-brown, palm-sized
It had fallen to the ground
Latief: At first I thought it was just a piece of wood because we often found fragments of ancient plants in the File's Leaf bed.
However, I went back to camp that night.
Natalia: If you take out the loupe and look a little closer, you will see that there are no tree rings
Maybe it's because of the state of preservation, but the more you look at it, the more —
It was a bone
Latief: She visited this spot many times over the next four years, and eventually collected 30 pieces of the same bone, mostly very small.
Natalia: There aren't many of them, just enough to fit in a small plastic bag
Latif: Like a puzzle, I tried to put the pieces together.
It was really hard work
Natalia: It was cracked and shattered, so I tried to use sand and putty, but it didn't work
So I ended up using a 3D scanner.
Latief: That's amazing! Natalia: Right?
Latief: It's much easier to work on a screen.
Natalia: I was a little impressed when they all came together
Latief: How confident were you that you were building it correctly?
If you build it in a different way, what are the chances that it will be different? Was it actually a parakeet?
Natalia: No definitely.
Latif: What she found was a bone, a leg bone, and it belonged to artiodactyls, a member of the cattle and sheep family.
But these bones weren't supposed to be cows or sheep.
It was too big
Natalia: It was oversized, it's a very big animal.
Latif: What kind of animal was it?
Getting stuck, she showed one of the bone fragments to a colleague in Colorado, and that's when she had an epiphany.
Natalia: When we saw and cut the edges of the bones, we got a characteristic smell
Latief: with a smell like burnt meat
It was the same smell that Natalia smelled when she severed her skull in the eerie dissection room: collagen.
Collagen plays a role in maintaining the structure of bones
As the years go by, it usually disintegrates.
In this case, the Arctic climate has become a natural refrigerator and has been preserved.
A year or two later, when Natalia attended a conference in Bristol, a fellow scholar named Mike Buckley was demonstrating a new process called "collagen testing."
Each animal has a slightly different collagen structure, and if you know the characteristics of the collagen of unknown bones, you can compare it with that of an animal that you already know, and maybe you can identify it.
That's why I sent one bone fragment by courier.
Natalia: I wanted to keep track of it because it's important
Latif: He processed bone fragments and compared them to 37 species of modern mammals.
Found a matching animal
The owner of the 3.5 million-year-old bones that Natalia unearthed in the Arctic Circle at high latitudes
It was a camel
Natalia: I was like, "What?"
Latief: We examined a lot of bone fragments, and they all had the same results.
However, based on the size of the bones they found, this camel was 30% larger than the current one.
It was about 2.7 meters tall — it weighed about 1 ton
Right
What Natalia discovered was a giant Arctic camel
When you hear the word camel, what comes to mind is a Bactrian camel that lives in East and Central Asia.
The image on the postcard in your head is probably this dromedary, and this is the desert creature, living in the hot deserts of the Middle East and the Sahara Desert, storing water for long desert journeys in the desert with a big hump on its back, and stepping on the dunes with its big broad legs.
How did such an animal reach the Arctic Circle in northern Canada?
In fact, scientists have known about it for a long time, even before the discovery of Natalia, and the camel actually originated in the United States.
This is where it was born
Camels have been around for about 45 million years, of which they were distributed only in North America for almost 40 million years, and there were about 20 species, maybe more.
Latief: If you put them all side by side, would you have seen the difference?
Natalia: yes, the size of the body varies.
There was also a very long-necked species, probably similar to the neck of a giraffe.
Latif: Some of them looked like crocodiles
Natalia: Early primitive camels were very small, about the size of a rabbit.
Latief: Huh? Is a rabbit size camel?
Natalia: is an early type
You wouldn't know it when you saw it
Latief: I'd like to have a rabbit or camel
Natalia: yes, I'm sure it's the best
Latief: Then, between 3 and 7 million years ago, herds of camels descended to South America and became llamas and alpacas, while other species crossed the Bering overpass and went to Asia and Africa.
Towards the end of the last ice age camels in North America became extinct
So far, so much so that we already know, but we can't fully explain what was found so far north.
For example, in terms of temperature, it's the opposite of the Sahara Desert.
It's true that 3.5 million years ago, temperatures averaged 22 degrees Celsius higher than today.
So there was a lot of coniferous forest, and it might have resembled the Yukon River valley or Siberia today.
But even so, the winter would have lasted for six months, and the pond would have frozen.
If there is also a blizzard
There would have been times when the darkness of the night would last for 24 hours
So what the hell is going on?
How did this Sahara superstar survive the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her fellow scholars think they've found the answer.
And it's a brilliant answer
What if the characteristics of camels that we thought were meant to adapt to places like the Sahara Desert were actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the wide feet were not for walking on sand, but for walking on snow, like a kanjiki?
The hump on your back — I didn't know and was surprised — it's not water, it's stuffed with fat, and what if that hump helped you get through six months of winter with little food?
Then, after crossing the overpass, what if you could use the winter-friendly features for the hot desert environment?
For example, a hump may be useful in hot climates, because if you store all your fat in one place, like a backpack, you don't have to cover your entire body with fat that acts as insulation.
This will make it easier for the heat to escape
This extraordinary idea could turn out to be evidence of what was thought to be prime evidence of desert adaptation, but in fact it once lived in the high-latitude Arctic Circle.
I'm not the first person to tell this story.
Others have used this story to tell the wonders of evolutionary biology and to unravel future climate change.
But the reason I like this story is different.
For me, it's my own story, and it's about our worldview and how it's changing.
I have been educated as a historian.
What we've come to understand is that most scientists are historians.
They also try to understand the past
It tells the history of life in space, on planets, and on Earth.
And as a historian, you start by thinking about how the story unfolds.
Natalia: We make a story and stick to it, for example, the story of a camel in the desert.
It's a very well-made story, the camel is perfectly adapted.
I've been in the desert for a long time
Latief: But someday we might find a little evidence
Understanding the little things can lead you to reassemble everything you believed in.
In this case, too, a fossil that looks like a piece of wood discovered by a scientist led science to a completely new hypothesis that goes beyond common sense about why this animal, which could appear in a Dr. Seuss picture book, looks like it does what it does.
My view of camels has completely changed.
I changed my view from being a very special animal that can only adapt to a specific environment in the desert to an animal that happens to be in the Sahara Desert but can actually live anywhere in the world.
(Applause) This is the Azzurri
Hi Azzurri Hello
Look, eat
The Azzurri usually perform at the Radio City Music Hall.
I'm not kidding
Now, this Azzurri is living proof that the story of our world is dynamic.
We have to reframe the story, we have to reimagine it.
Right? Azzurri
Beyond every bone, there is a new way of looking at the world.
Thank you very much
Modern computers are so good that we don't even realize how bad they are.
Today I want to talk about this problem and how to "repair" it in neuroscience
2011 Frosty Night in Harlem That night had a deep impact on me.
I was studying computer science and neuroscience at a bar outside Columbia University, and I was having a meaningful conversation with one of my schoolmates about the power of holograms, which would one day replace computers.
When our conversation reached its climax, his phone lit up.
He pulled out his phone, turned his attention to it, and started typing.
And he looked up at me with just his eyes and said, "Keep listening."
But, of course, his gaze became blurred, and the meaning of that time was lost.
At that moment, on the other side of the bar, another student grabbed a smartphone and held it up to a group of friends.
I was swiping and showing them Instagram photos, and they were laughing.
I started to think about how I was frustrated with the same technology and they were happy.
The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the "bad guy" wasn't the digital information itself, but simply the display device that separated me from my friends, but also brought them together.
They were connected around something, like our ancestors who developed social cognition by telling stories around a bonfire, and I think that's what this tool is for.
It should be an extension of bodily functions
The opposite is happening on computers today.
When you're texting your wife, composing a symphony, or comforting a friend, you're doing exactly the same thing.
While bending down, I am operating the icons and menu buttons that appear endlessly displayed in squares like this.
I think this is wrong, and I think we can start using "natural machines" a lot more.
We should use machines that bring these tasks back to the real world
By applying neuroscience principles, we should use machines that expand perception rather than limit it.
Come on, here is such a machine.
This is "Meta 2"
Let's try it out
Now I can see you in front of me, and I can see my hands.
Now let's go into a 3-2-1 immersive hologram experience, with a very realistic hologram floating right in front of me—right in front of the headset I'm wearing.
Of course, what you're looking at can be a product you're shopping for, or it can be a learning material, and you can use your hands to control it and move it well.
Ironman would be proud of him
I'll show you this in a moment.
(Applause) If you're thinking like me, you're excited to see what you can do with this kind of technology, and you're excited about the possibilities, so let's take a look at a few.
My mother is an architect, so the idea of drawing a blueprint for a building in a three-dimensional space instead of a two-dimensional drawing came to mind.
My mom is now in the process of choosing the interior decoration by touching the video.
This was all shot through the headgear using a GoPro camera
This next use case is a very personal one, the "Glass Brain" project by Professor Adam Gathery of the University of California, San Francisco.
As a neuroscience student, I always dreamed of learning and learning and remembering with a machine that could touch and manipulate this diverse and complex structure of the brain.
What we're looking at right now is augmented reality, but it's part of a bigger initiative: to augment physical capabilities with digital devices instead of limiting them.
Who knows...
I think humanity will reach a turning point in the next few years.
All digital information is starting to appear in the real world.
Imagine for a moment what does this mean to us as storytellers, painters, brain surgeons, interior designers, and so on?
What we need to do as a community is to imagine how we can create a new reality that augments the human experience, and not just gamify reality or mess it up with digital information.
I'm very passionate about this.
Now, I'm going to reveal a little secret.
Within about five years, this is not a small device, but within about five years, all of these will be like thin glasses that project holograms.
When we choose a smartphone, we don't pay much attention to the hardware itself, we focus on the basic software, but as a neuroscientist, I have always dreamed of creating an "iOS of the mind," so to speak.
It's very important to get this right, because we might spend at least as much time with a system like this as the Windows screen interface.
I don't know about you – it's crazy to live in Windows.
To come up with the most intuitive interface out of all the possibilities, we made neuroscience the cornerstone of our design, instead of having designers argue in the boardroom.
And the principle at the heart of this is called the "Least Resistance Pathway"
Constantly connecting the "iOS of the mind" to the human brain - for the first time, the human brain controls the iOS
In other words, you're trying to build a computer that doesn't need to learn how to use it.
We are creating a system that users can naturally understand how to use.
Here are three of the main design guidelines we've used for user experience:
The most important thing is that the user is the OS
Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and it takes a lot of brainpower to understand them.
It is doing the reverse of the "minimum resistance nerve pathway"
But in augmented reality, if you put a holographic TED panel here and put a hologram email on the other side of your desk, your spatial memory ability will adapt to this, and you can reach out and retrieve the information.
From the Tesla car I want to buy to the one my legal team asked me to do before I take the stage, I can display anything in holograms.
Okay, now your brain has learned how to extract information.
The second guiding principle of the interface is "see and touch"
When you see something that interests your baby, what is the first thing you do?
You reach out and try to touch it
This is how a "natural machine" should work.
The visual system receives its basic stimuli from what is called proprioceptive sensation, which is a sensation that occurs deep in the body.
So by coming into direct contact with the work, you can not only have better control over it, but also understand it more deeply.
Therefore, we "see and touch"
But that's not enough of an experience.
Humans are primates by nature social creatures
This leads us to a third pointer: a holographic version of the bonfire example at the beginning
The mirror neuron subsystem of primates shows that if we can see each other's faces and hands in three dimensions, we can work better with each other.
Watch the video behind me: Two Meta users are working with the same hologram, exchanging glances without being distracted by the device, and connecting through this object.
Now, with neuroscience in mind, let's try this again
Our favorite is "iOS of the Heart"
Let's go one step further by picking up this headset and placing it in this place next to your desk
Right now, I'm with you, and at this moment, we're connected.
My spatial memory kicks in, and when I grab the headset and take it back, I realize that I'm the OS.
And then my proprioceptive senses kick in, and I break the headset down into thousands of parts — and touch the sensors that scan my hand.
But it's not enough to just watch this on your own, so now our co-founder, Ray, is going to be making a 3D phone call soon—Ray?
(ringing) Hi Ray How are you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I can see him in front of me in three dimensions.
With a photorealistic feel
(Applause) Thank you very much
My mirror neuron system suggests that this will soon replace cell phones.
Ray: How's it going?
Okay, we're having a live conversation right now.
(Applause) Ray: I just saw a video showing you the hologram brain.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not only going to change the phone, it's going to change the way we work together.
Thank you very much
Ray: Thank you
You are welcome
This is the message I found in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not confined to a flat screen.
It's here in us.
If I had to pick just one idea today, it would be that the "natural machine" is not something that will be made up of the future, but that it will be here and now in 2016.
That's why all 100 people working at Meta – admins, executives, designers, and engineers – will be throwing out their monitor screens and using a truly "natural machine" by the time TED2017 is done.
Thank you very much
(Applause) Thank you very much
Thank you
Chris Anderson: Well, I'd like to ask you -- we've done a couple of augmented reality demos over the past few years.
There is also a debate among engineers about whether they are actually seeing things on the big screen
There was also a point about the field of view, which was pointed out that the demo gives a wider field of view than what you see when you wear the actual headset.
Is it the actual video that you showed?
Of course, it's real.
Not only that, but when I made the video I introduced, I was especially creative in shooting it through the lens of my GoPro camera.
We wanted everyone to experience the real experience that you see through the headgear as it is.
Thanks for the referral
Thank you very much
I'm from one of the most free, tolerant, and progressive places in America — Seattle, Washington
I grew up in a wonderful Seattleite family.
My mother is an artist, my father is a university professor, and I am very grateful for the environment in which I grew up, because I have always been able to decide my own way of life without hesitation.
I didn't actually follow the path my parents had envisioned.
I dropped out of college at the age of 19 — I don't care if I dropped out or dropped out.
And as a professional horn player, I started touring all over the place, which was something I'd always dreamed of.
While playing chamber music, he traveled all over the United States and Europe, and for several years he worked with Charlie Byrd, a great jazz guitar player.
By the end of my twenties, I was a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
What a good life
Parents never complained
They have always supported me
It wasn't their ideal, though
He told his neighbors and friends, "My son is in the middle of a gap year — about 10 years."
But — I've had one awkward conversation about my way of life, so let me tell you.
I was 27 years old, I was returning home from Barcelona, I was back home for the Christmas holidays, I was cooking with my mother in the kitchen, and we were alone.
My mother is taciturn, too taciturn—
I thought something was wrong.
"Mom, what are you thinking?"
She said, "We're very worried about you."
"What do you mean?" I wondered what I was talking about
"Answer me absolutely honestly — you don't vote Republican, do you?"
Well, the truth is, I was just a horn player who wasn't that interested in politics.
There was a little bit of enlightenment, and my parents were a little confused when they realized it.
I was an ardent supporter of capitalism, and I'll tell you how it came to be.
It comes from something that I've always been interested in, and it may come as a surprise, but it's poverty.
When I was a kid in Seattle, I remember seeing real poverty for the first time.
My family was low-middle-class, but of course it wasn't real poverty.
It was far from it
The first time I saw poverty and poverty was in the early 70s, when I was 6 or 7 years old.
It was a mundane experience that everyone has experienced.
This is a picture of a child my age in East Africa with flies on his face and a bulging belly.
It was clear that I couldn't help it anymore, but there was nothing I could do about it.
Some of you may remember that photo, not the same photo, even if it is similar.
It is a photo that made the image of poverty that continues to plague the world known to Western countries
That picture burned into my eyes, I grew up, I went to school, I dropped out, I went back to school, I had a family, but I still couldn't forget it.
I was curious what happened to that kid
I wonder what happened to people like him all over the world.
So I started researching, I wasn't in college at the time, but I was looking for answers: What happened to the people at the height of poverty in the world?
Did it get worse, did it get better, what happened?
And then I found the answer, it changed my life, and I'm going to tell you about it.
Now— most Americans think poverty has gotten worse when they were kids—than it was in that picture.
If you ask Americans whether global poverty has worsened or improved, 70% will tell you that hunger has worsened since the early 70s.
Let's tell you the truth.
This is the enlightenment that changed my worldview
Between 1970 and today, the proportion of the world's population living on hunger — those living on less than $1 a day — adjusted for inflation — has fallen by 80 percent.
Compared to my childhood, the world's worst poverty has decreased by 80%.
I didn't even know that
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a miracle
It's something to rejoice in
It's the greatest feat in human history to fight poverty, and that's what happened in our generation.
When I found out about this, I wondered, what made it possible to achieve this?
If you don't know why it was done, you can't reproduce it.
If we want to replicate this and lift another 2 billion people out of poverty — that's the point — from my childhood to now, 2 billion of our brothers and sisters, the "little ones" in the Bible, have been lifted out of poverty.
We want to know to save another 2 billion people.
So I started looking for answers
Politics didn't matter to me, it didn't matter to me.
I'm still not interested
I wanted the best answer from mainstream economists, right, left, center, no matter.
Let's say the answer
There are 5 success factors
To date, we have lifted 2 billion of our brothers and sisters from poverty.
The first is globalization
The second is free trade
The third is property rights
The fourth is the rule of law
The fifth is entrepreneurship
Since the 70s, the whole world has become a free enterprise system, and since the 70s, the whole world has become a free enterprise system.
But I'm not simple either.
We know that free enterprise is not perfect, and we know that we need more than free enterprise to build a better world.
But it's amazing.
It's an issue that transcends politics
What I've Learned, What I've Realized
The significance of capitalism is not limited to the accumulation of wealth.
The best thing about capitalism is that it has aspirations, and a lot of people talk about aspirations on this stage, which is aspiration, and it's deeply connected to the free enterprise system.
We need to spread this aspiration more and more.
Now, let's talk about the second enlightenment, which is related to the first enlightenment, and it is something that will bring progress not only to the world, but also to this city that we are in, not only in the world, but also in this city where we are now.
Of all the people I've heard, the one that best sums up the idea of poverty alleviation that I just talked about is this: "No institution in human history has created wealth more than the free market.
It lifted billions out of poverty."
Whose words are they?
It sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan
That's not it
This is President Barack Obama
Why do you say that?
Because I was told directly
You won't believe it
The first thing that came out of my mouth was "Banzai!"
In addition, I thought, "What a wonderful opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, in the middle of an event on this subject, it was at Georgetown University.
I thought this was the solution to the biggest problem facing the United States.
It doesn't matter if you're a liberal or a conservative, it's about reaching out to those who need us most, under the idea that the free market will solve poverty.
You don't have to say it, but you know that crises in the United States and around the world are because of political polarization.
We are now at a critical juncture.
It's an unpleasant situation, this shouldn't be
Last year, a paper was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences, and it is the most authoritative scientific journal published in the West.
In my 2014 thesis, the theme was "Asymmetry of Political Motivations."
What this means, by psychologist definition, is that you assume that your own ideology is born out of love, but your enemy's worldview is born out of hatred.
It is common in world conflicts
For example, this is a phenomenon between Palestinians and Israelis.
What did the authors find? In the United States today, the vast majority of people, both Republicans and Democrats, fall into the idea of "politically motivated asymmetry."
The vast majority of politically active people in America today believe that they are driven by love and the other is driven by hatred.
Think about it
Most people's idea is: "My ideology is based on a very basic tolerance, I want to help people, but the others are the bad guys who are trying to trap me."
As long as there is this kind of asymmetry, we will not be able to move forward as a society.
It's impossible
So what's the solution?
First of all, let's be honest, there are differences, and it's natural.
Don't underestimate the differences, it's not that simple.
There's a lot of good research on this
Veteran TED speaker and friend Jonathan Haidt
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
I study differences in ideologies, values, and morals among various people.
According to him, conservatives and liberals, for example, have very different views on what's important.
For example, according to Haidt, 59% more liberals care about poverty than those who value economic freedom.
Among conservatives, there are 28% more people who value economic freedom than those who care about poverty.
This gap doesn't seem to be closing
They're never compatible? Wrong
It's called diversity, and that's where our strength lies.
Do you remember what delivered the poor?
The obsession with the problem of poverty spread around the world through the means of a free economy.
I mean, we need each other, if we want to lift the next 2 billion people out of poverty and help people.
There is no other way
well
How can we achieve this?
It's difficult right
You need an innovative mindset
There are a lot of them on this platform
Social entrepreneurship — yes, there's no doubt about it, it's awesome.
We need sustainable, ethical, moral, and responsible foreign investments.
Absolutely! But what do you really need?
It's a new world with flexible ideologies
We need more surprise
Right?
Have you ever felt that your ideology has become stereotyped?
It's kind of cliché, isn't it?
Do you feel like you're listening to people who have the same opinion as you?
Why is this dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, there are conservatives on the right who are talking about taxes and regulations and big government.
There are liberals on the left, and whenever we talk about the economy, it's about income inequality.
It's both important, it's really important to me and to you.
Today, when we talk about lifting people out of poverty who are suffering from hunger and needing help, this gets in the way.
We should work together in the best possible way to alleviate poverty with the best tools at our disposal, and that will only be possible if we mutually recognize that liberals and their obsession with poverty are necessary for conservatives and their obsession with the free market for liberals.
This diversity, if embraced, will be one of America's strengths in the future.
So how can we do this together?
I need a list of activities, not just for you, but also for myself.
No. 1 — Item 1: Keep in mind that it's not enough to tolerate people who disagree.
That's not enough
You have to keep in mind that you need people who don't agree with you, because there are people who are still waiting for these tools that our diversity can provide.
Now, what do I do, how do I tell them?
Where does it start here?
We are all in this room, we are blessed.
I'm blessed with people who listen to me.
I'm also blessed with success and leadership
If you talk about an ideology you don't think of, they might listen.
Progress may start there
That's the first one, then the second one.
I want you to be, and I want you to be the person I want to be, especially someone who can blur boundaries, someone who is hard to fit into.
If you're a conservative, you're always talking about poverty, you're talking about your moral obligation to fight for the poor.
If you're a liberal, you're going to be the kind of liberal who always talks about the benefits of the free market when you use it responsibly to solve our problems.
That way, two things happen
First, we can start saving the next 2 billion people, and we can work on the solutions that we need in the future, as we have seen a lot in the past.
Second, we can turn the terrible and sacred ideological battle that we are going through under this country into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
Then maybe we'll realize that the big difference we think we're making isn't that big after all.
Thank you very much
I majored in politics at university, so I had to write a lot of papers.
If a normal student were to write a report, the amount of work would be distributed like this.
This is how it starts out slowly, but it goes well in the first week, and then it gets a little more demanding in the second half, but it keeps things orderly.
That's what I want to do.
The plan is as follows:
I'm going to start working on it right away, but when it comes to actually doing the report, in my case, it looks like this.
This happens every time
Then I had to write a 90-page thesis, which I had to write over the course of a year.
I knew the way I always did things wasn't going to work.
The scale is too large
So I made a plan and decided to do it like this.
It's a one-year plan
It's like a gentle staircase that starts lightly, goes up a little in the middle, and spurts at the end.
Going up this staircase is
It shouldn't be difficult
But then something strange happened.
If the first few months
It came and went, but I couldn't do anything.
Therefore, the plan is changed as follows
And then — the middle period has passed, but I can't write, and I'm in this state.
Another two months become one month, and then another two weeks.
I woke up one morning and I only had three days until the deadline, I hadn't written a word yet, I had no choice, I had to write a 90-page paper in 72 hours, and I stayed up all night for two nights in a row, and the human body wasn't designed to do that, but I ran all the way through the campus, and time turned into slow motion, and I submitted it at the moment of the deadline.
I thought that was the end of it.
A week later, I got a call from the university.
"Is it Tim Urban? ｣
"Yes."
"I have a story to tell you about the paper you submitted."
"Huh."
And he said, "I've never seen such a wonderful thesis."
It didn't happen.
It was a terrible paper
I just wanted people to think, "Isn't this guy a genius?"
It's a terrible paper
I'm currently a writer.
I write a blog called "Wait But Why"
About two years ago, I decided to write about procrastination
My behavior was always confusing the people around me, so I wondered what was going on in the procrastinator's head and why we were the way we were.
I wanted to explain to people who aren't procrastinators, and I thought there must be a difference between the brains of procrastinators and the brains of non-procrastinators.
To confirm this, I decided to find a place that would take an MRI of my brain and the brain of someone who was sure to be a procrastinator and compare it
The results are here today.
I want you to pay attention to see if you can tell the difference.
If you're not a brain expert, it's a difficult difference to understand, but anyway, take a look.
This is the brain of a person who is not a procrastinator
[Rational Decision Maker]
It's my brain —
[Monkeys who want an immediate reward] This is the difference between the two
In both brains, there is a "rational decision-maker," but in the case of the procrastinator's brain, there is also a "monkey who wants an immediate reward."
What does that have to do with procrastination?
All is well until this happens.
"I'd better do a little work." "No." Rational decision-makers make rational decisions to do something productive, but monkeys don't like it, so they take the helm and say, "Yes, Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding's case Let's read the Wikipedia article on the case, because I remembered that such a thing happened.
Then — I need to go check the fridge and see if anything has changed since 10 minutes ago.
Then there's the YouTube spiral waiting for you, starting with a video of Richard Feynman talking about magnets, and much later watching an interview with Justin Bieber's mom.
I'm sorry because I have my hands full with that for the time being, but I'm already here today.
I can't afford to put in work."
What's going on?
The monkey is not the one who wants you to take the helm.
I live only in the present moment.
I don't have any memories of the past, I don't know anything about the future, I only care about two things: easy and fun.
If it's the animal world, that's fine.
If it's a dog, it's a very successful way to live doing only easy and fun things all the time.
For monkeys, humans are just another kind of animal.
All you have to do is eat well, sleep well, and give birth to the next generation.
We don't live a primitive life anymore
We live in an advanced civilized society, but monkeys don't know what it is.
That's why we have another "rational decision-maker" in our brains, which gives us abilities that other animals don't have.
We imagine the future
See the big picture
Plan for the long term
A rational decision-maker takes all things into account.
I try to get them to do what they have to do right now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do something easy and fun, like at dinner, sleep, or leisure.
There is some overlap between the two.
There are times when we disagree.
But in the grand scheme of things, it sometimes makes sense to do something that's difficult and not very fun.
That's when conflict arises.
If you're a procrastinator, this conflict always tends to end in a certain outcome, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the orange areas, which don't make sense to do, and are easy and fun.
I call this area the "playground of darkness."
The playground of darkness — a place that all procrastinators know well.
If you're playing, it's where you're going to play when you're not.
Fun in the playground of darkness isn't really fun, it's not supposed to be fun, it's fun, it's filled with familiar feelings of procrastination: guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing.
The question is, with the monkey at the helm, how can the procrastinator move into the blue realm, where less comfortable but really important things happen?
In fact, procrastinators have a guardian angel who is always watching over them, even in the worst of times, which is also called the "panic monster."
Panic Monsters are asleep most of the time, but they wake up suddenly when a deadline is looming, when they are about to lose face, or when they are approaching a terrible ending, such as a professional crisis.
The point is that it's the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Most recently, I was contacted by TED people six months ago and asked if I would like to give a TED talk.
Of course, I replied, "I will."
It's been a dream of mine for many years to be able to say, "I've given a TED talk before."
In the midst of all this excitement, rational decision-makers care about something else.
"Do you know what I took on?
Do you know what's going to happen one day in the future?
We need to sit down and start now! ｣
The monkey replied, "I totally agree, but for the time being, if you open Google Earth, zoom in on the bottom edge of India to 60 meters above the ground, scroll for two and a half hours, and go to the top edge, I think you can get a good idea of India."
So I was doing it all day.
Six months have become four months, two months have become one, and TED has released a list of speakers.
When I opened the page, there was my face staring back at me.
So who woke up?
The panic monster went into a frenzy, and soon the whole system was thrown into chaos.
Remember that monkeys are afraid of panic monsters, so they run away from the treetops.
Now that I was finally able to take the helm of a rational decision-maker, I was ready to give a talk.
The panic monster can explain the erratic behavior of procrastinators, and it can take two weeks to write a single line of a report, but it miraculously awakens to an intense work ethic and takes eight pages through the night.
This is the whole situation with three characters and the system of procrastination.
It's not pretty, but it works in the end
This is what I decided to write about on my blog two years ago
When I wrote it, I was surprised by the response to the blog.
Literally thousands of emails came from all over the world, from so many different people.
Nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and so many graduate students
Everyone was writing the same thing: "I have the same problem."
But the lightness of the blog post contrasted with the weight of the email I received.
It was written with a strong sense of frustration at the impact that procrastination is having on their lives, and how they are going through because of the monkeys.
When I saw that, I thought, what's going on with the procrastinator's system working?
Why are they in such a gloomy state?
What I found is that there are two types of procrastination.
In the example I talked about, there was a deadline.
When there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are limited to a short period of time, and the panic monster comes into play.
But there's another kind of procrastination, and there's no deadline for it.
In the case of entrepreneurial work, like a solopreneur or an artist, you don't have a deadline in the beginning, because nothing happens until you go out and do something, get off the ground, and get going.
There are also a lot of important things outside of work that don't have deadlines, like going to see your family, exercising and staying healthy, building relationships, and resolving relationships that don't work out.
If panic monsters were the only mechanism for procrastinators to do these difficult things, then there was a problem, because in a situation where there is no deadline, panic monsters don't appear.
There is nothing to wake you up, and the effects of procrastination are not limited, and you will continue to procrastinate indefinitely.
Such long-term procrastination is less visible and untalked about than comical, short-term procrastination with deadlines, and is usually tormented by one person and quietly.
Long-term and great unhappiness and regret
I thought that could be the source, and that's why those people wrote the email, and that's why they're in such a terrible situation.
It's not canned in any project
Long-term procrastination can make you feel like a bystander to your life.
Their frustration is not that they can't achieve their dreams, but that they can't even start chasing them.
As I read those emails, it occurred to me that no one is not a procrastinator.
We're all procrastinators
Even if you're not as crazy as I am, you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but keep in mind that the worst part of the monkey problem is when you don't have a deadline.
There is one last thing I would like to show you.
It is a "life calendar"
Each box represents a week in 90 years of life.
We don't have that many, and we're already using them quite a bit.
I think we should all take a closer look at this calendar.
What are you really procrastinating, because everyone is procrastinating on something.
You need to be aware of the monkeys that want a quick reward
It's a job for all of us.
Considering that there aren't that many boxes, this work should start today.
Well, if not right today.
If possible
Not Far Away
Thank you very much
At that time, I was in a Texas church full of souls and bodies, waiting with trepidation for the last moment of my life.
It was just like this, sitting shallowly on a crumbling wooden chair covered with red rags, with an organ on the left, a choir behind it, and a baptismal tub behind it.
It doesn't change at all
The tension that rushes out, the longing for salvation, the sweaty palms, and the people who sit in the back who don't seem to be very interested.
December 31, 1999 The Night of Christ's Second Coming, when I believed that the world would end.
That year, I turned exactly 12 years old, the age at which I was officially recognized as a full-fledged person in the scriptures.
And yet, I was tempted to complain that it would be unfair for the world to end, but it was a later festival, and I had to rethink what was to come.
Change your mind and go to church as much as you can.
I prayed so earnestly that I forgot the passage of time, because God had noticed my unbelief and was desperate not to come ahead of schedule.
And just in case, I was reading all the books that were popular at the time, "Please save me."
At one point, I found in a sentence that if one person lacks that faith, more tragedy awaits.
At any rate, my task is to control all desires, to overcome the devil and inertia, and to triumph over my own non-beliefs.
It's hard for a 12-year-old, let's believe we can do it.
The time is finally approaching
11:50 p.m.
With 10 minutes left, the pastor gathered us in front of the altar to greet the moment when the hands of the clock pointed to the fateful time.
People of all denominations come together
The choir remains in their seats, and the deacons and their wives – bourgeois members – take up positions in the front row of the altar
As you know, in the United States, even at the Second Coming of Christ, VIP seating is available.
(Applause) Right behind the VIP are the elderly people In the scorching East Texas sunshine I continued to work in the cotton fields I think of their backs when they were young. Browned and tanned Its wrinkle-free skin is like the earth itself. If only I could live a different life. With such a dream, These are people who have been betrayed over and over again. Yes, they are.
They're the stars of the show for me.
They have devoted their entire lives to this moment, just as their medieval forefathers looked forward to the arrival of the last days, and they made their lives worth living on talk shows that started at 4 o'clock every day.
Like my grandmother, she would go to the altar, and I would follow her back, and I would follow her secretly, and I was sure that she would go to heaven.
I was thinking that if I held her hand during prayer, we would go to heaven together.
I held my hands, closed my eyes, listened, and prayed.
The pastor's voice was hoarse
The prayer in response becomes a cry and echoes through the church.
The melody of the keyboard gains its momentum,
The enthusiasm that ensues envelops the church
I will hold my grandmother's hand again so that she will not be left behind.
In the face of the horror of fate, I fled into the darkness behind my eyelids
And that voice pours down "Amen."
Done
The hands of the clock are
The fateful time has already passed
The Messiah didn't show up, and I stared, my eyes swimming, and I couldn't even notice the new possibilities because I closed my eyes for so long that I couldn't even notice the new possibilities.
I was heartbroken to see them like that
They were deceived, they were deceived victims, and I was one of them.
I have been praying, trying not to succumb to temptation.
I've been through that baptism of trials twice, not once, but twice, and I believed in it.
Until that time, certainly
When I got home and turned on the TV, Peter Jennings was celebrating the beginning of a new millennium, and the news was all over the world.
At that time, a strange thought crossed my mind, wondering if God would come down again and again, worrying about the time difference.
This inspiration was so ridiculous and cruel
But that didn't stop me from believing.
And then you have a new faith, the faith that there is no one answer.
My answer was wrong, the problem itself was wrong, the belief in confronting its absurdity.
A new ray of sunlight shines into the frozen and motionless winter mountains of faith, and the melting snow of possibility begins to flow into the unseen landscape.
I still look back and think about that night when the Messiah didn't come, that moment when what I believed in fell apart in an instant, even if it wasn't a lie, that moment when I knew it wasn't true.
Some of the many people who celebrated the year 2000 in a completely different way will be here at the end of the same process that I followed after that. Starting at the dawn of the new millennium, my mother left, I couldn't get in touch with my father, and even God From that day when he rejected me.
I reached out to grab something I could believe in, this time
At the age of 18, I entered Yale University, and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to break with all those dark pasts that I had seen in Oakcliffs, Texas, where dreams and hopes had been shattered.
But one day during the winter holidays, I was lying face down on the floor of my house, my hands were tied tightly behind my back, and a robber was holding a gun to my head, and I finally realized that education wasn't going to save me.
In 2008, I reached out for the next salvation at a company called Lehman Brothers.
I'm going to call home in a hurry, and I'm not going to suffer with money anymore.
But even that financial center collapsed before my eyes, and even the business was abandoned by me.
Undeterred, as a youth staff member in Washington, D.C., I reach for my next hope, and the voices coming from Illinois shout out loud, "The time has come," "Change is coming to America."
But Congress failed, the state rather tore away hope, and "change" became an unfunny joke, and when politics returned, nothing happened, it didn't save it.
I have indeed sworn allegiance at that altar, which I have dubbed the American Dream, and I have knelt to the God of capitalism, for success, for wealth, and for power.
And yet, when the date changes, I keep my eyes open, wondering if there really wasn't a God.
That night, I decided to face it again, not because I was brave, but because I was either going to die or believe, and that was the only choice I had left.
And then I walked to the next holy place, Harvard Business School, and I didn't settle for the relief that sounded good, because I knew.
I think I'm not working hard enough.
It was one night not long after the start of the harsh Cambridge winter, and in the corner of a party that wasn't getting excited, three friends and I brought up a topic, which every young person has experienced at least once, and it was a common topic of youth: "Let's go on a trip."
We didn't know where we were going or how we were going to get there.
But I was obsessed with Jack Kerouac's novel, "Slipping out into the night and disappearing quietly," and we set out to find out what was going on in this country.
Of course, there were many voices against it, and above all, it was extremely decent, but we took the first step anyway
In the summer of 2013, the 8,000-mile journey around the United States began, through the meadows of Montana, the ruins of Detroit, and the swamps of New Orleans.
I was trained in the highest school of capitalism, so I was rather innovative.
This idea grew into a non-profit organization called MBAs Across America, and it was that wave that brought me to the TED stage.
How greedy our generation is for purpose and meaning.
We have noticed that we need a little more support for the many entrepreneurs who are creating jobs and making changes in the shadows.
We finally realized, and to be honest, the other important thing is that I made an effort to make waves.
There was certainly an idea in the past that each and every one of the social enterprises could heal and comfort the wounds of this crumbling country and make them stand up again, so that as many people as possible could feel that way.
But this missionary journey has led me to a new gospel, and that's why I'm here today.
About a year ago, one evening I was at the Natural History Museum in New York at Harvard Business School.
Under a life-size replica of a whale hung from the ceiling, we sat down with the Fuyun children of the era and praised the achievements of our alumni and the spirit of social contribution.
It was a space full of pride, with a network of people and their assets well over $500 billion.
If you look at what we've accomplished, they're all beautiful.
But it didn't end there, two days later, I went to the Harlem area to sit in a corner of a farm that was once a vacant lot, and I heard from a man named Tony about the children who came to the farm every day.
It's a story about children who live below the poverty line
They carry their belongings with them even when they sleep so that they won't be stolen at homeless shelters.
"Harlem Grown," Tony's program is called "Harlem Grown," and these kids come in for a meal once a day.
After 20 years as a taxi driver, Tony cut into his pension to start the program.
He didn't get paid because he was short on money while his activities were expanding.
He said he was going to cling to any straw
And I'm determined to be that straw.
On the way home, a dull sound rang in the back of my chest, and I just shed tears
I was so ignorant that under one roof there was a replica of a whale floating around, and a group of people moving $500 billion gathered, and two days later, just 50 blocks north, a man was scrambling without pay to prepare a meal for his children.
I didn't weep over inequality, I didn't cry out of pity for hunger or homeless children, I didn't cry out of anger at the wealth of the 1%, nor did I cry out for the poverty of the 99%.
I was just upset in a country with kidney disease in front of the fact that I was on dialysis.
I realized that my story is for people who have to keep walking, even if they don't have shoes, and that this is exactly what they should have heard, all the voiceless voices that have been overlooked to deliver effective aid to the disaster areas of Harlem, Appalachia, and New Orleans.
That spark put me completely ashamed, and reminded me of the unreasonableness that Peter Jennings heralded over and over again, over and over again, deceived and deceived.
It was deceitful
But this time, I myself was a false savior, I believed that the world would end, and I had come a long way from that altar that night, that suffering was the atonement to God, that God's word was everything, that the scriptures were the truth.
From that world that I believed in, after a long road, I am standing at the starting point again.
The age we live in today is not an age of unbelief, but rather we believe in it as much as the past.
Brené Brown Some may believe her words could be Tony Robbins
"The New Yorker" "Harvard Business Review"
I'm sure there are people who believe in them, and most of all, right now in the TED church, we're praying, we want to believe, we need to believe.
We want leaders who can solve all kinds of problems.
They believe that suffering is a necessary evil in the God of capitalism, and they believe that the scripture of technological progress is absolute.
But when we are so afraid that our beliefs will be shaken from our foundations, and we neglect to question each element of our foundations, the human sacrifice that comes with it is overlooked.
If something is holding you back from accepting it, it's time to stop and ask questions.
Creativity, innovation, and social, environmental, and economic responsibility are not my domain.
In fact, I'm not trying to spread any doctrinal gospel here.
The Gospel of Doubting That's why I'm here
This gospel doesn't tell us to stop believing, it just asks for a new attitude, the idea that there is no one answer.
We accept the mistakes of the past, and we leave room for the absurdity of the question itself, which is a mistake in itself.
This gospel of doubt suggests that we can be wrong in this place, in this space.
The "why" question is the gospel
Where is the need for people to suffer for nothing, to the point of abandoning the power that has been given to us to question ourselves?
It was out of this belief that I made a decision about my work, MBAs Across America, to make it a non-profit organization.
We've cut our staff, we've stopped new hires, and we've made our business model freely available to those who need it.
The reminder asked me to abandon the role of savior that people had imposed on me, because our lives were too short to wait again for the Second Coming of Christ in the face of the truth that miracles would not happen.
This gospel of doubt, even when you despair and feel like there's no end in sight, should encourage you, give you hope, and illuminate the future, even in painful and painful times, Don't drown in the thought cessation of blind faith, that inner voice that dares to question becomes a small, faint, but irreplaceable light, illuminating the darkness, be a whisper.
Even if it's a cry, just say it out loud, "There must be another way."
Thank you very much
Food crisis
It's in the news on a daily basis
What does that mean?
In some parts of the world, there is a shortage of food and an oversupply.
GMOs, on the other hand, are saving the world.
GMOs may also have problems
Excessive agricultural effluents pollute the oceans, introduce toxins and reduce their nutritional value.
This goes on and on
I'm very discouraged by today's discussion about the environment.
How can we solve this problem with our knowledge?
Let's take a look at the food problem of apples
You've probably eaten at least one apple last week.
How long do you think it's been since you picked that apple?
Two weeks?
2 months?
11 months – that's the average for apples in U.S. grocery stores.
I don't think it's much different in Europe or in other countries around the world.
Apples are picked, stored in a refrigerator, and filled with a preservative gas, and there are records of workers dying while trying to pick apples in this storage because the air that slows down the decay of apples is toxic to humans.
Why didn't anyone know about this?
Why didn't I know?
90% of the antioxidant components in apples are lost by the time they are eaten
In this it is just a lump of sugar
Why are we so ill-informed? How can I improve it?
It's because the platform is missing.
Speaking of platforms, computers, when I was young, on the Internet, very dangerous things.
I did it on this platform.
But I was also able to meet people and express myself.
How do you use food to express yourself?
If you have a platform, you can ask "what if..."
My question was: What if the climate was equal for everyone?
This is a world climate map
Areas with high productivity are shown in green, and areas with low productivity are shown in red
Colors move and change, and the agricultural center that was in California is now moving to Mexico.
China is growing better food on Brazilian soil, and we are subject to the climate.
What if each country had a climate suitable for production?
How will it change people's lives?
Will it change the quality of life and nutrition?
For the previous generation, the problem was getting more food – cheaper.
Welcome to the world of global farms
Mankind has built a huge analogue farm
The lines depicted here represent food transportation connected by car, plane, rail, etc.
It is miraculous that food for a population of 7 billion is produced by a small percentage of people.
What if...
What if you could build a digital farm?
It is a digital farm that spreads around the world
What if we could take these apples, digitize them in some way, propagate them through the air as particles, and reassemble them elsewhere?
What if...
I read what is written here, and I was inspired to start this research.
First, Japan agriculture has no young labor, no water, no land, no future. Seeing this, I headed to Minamisoma, which was just north of Fukushima, which was hit by the earthquake at that time.
Because the land was contaminated, the children moved to Sendai and Tokyo. Japan already relies on imports for 70% of its food.
Food problems are not limited to Japan.
In the United States, 2% of the population is engaged in agriculture
No matter what country you are in, there is only so much you can do with 2%
If you look around the rest of the world – 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18
80% of them don't want to be farmers.
Agriculture is hard work
Small-scale farming, farmers' lives are miserable.
It flows into urban areas
In India, farmers don't even have access to water or electricity, and the number of farmers who committed suicide this year was the highest in a decade.
It's really disgusting
Where do the farmers go?
It is an urban area
Young people don't stay in their hometowns, they all move into urban areas.
So how can we build a platform that inspires young people?
Introducing a new type of tractor!
This is the combine harvester I created
Many years ago, I went to a grocery store or a DIY store and started making crafts.
I started making weird things, trying to make the plants dance, and when I connected the plants to the computer, they all died, and there were a lot of them.
In the end, I was able to prevent it from withering
I built what would become one of the most intimate relationships of my life, and that was that I began to understand the language of plants.
If you want to grow bigger
They said, "Oh my God!
Nobody wants to go in here, just an old electrical lab.
What do you think you can do?"
Together with my colleagues, we built a farm in the MIT Media Lab, which has been known as a laboratory for digital life, not biology.
In this space of about 6 square meters, we produced enough food for 300 people every month, although it is not a large amount.
There's a lot of interesting technology going on there.
What's the most interesting part of it?
Beautiful white roots, dark green vegetables and monthly cuttings
Is this a new type of cafeteria?
A new retail experience?
A new grocery store?
One thing is for sure: this is the first time in the Media Lab that something has been plucked from the roots.
There is a salad in the bag, but there is nothing wrong with it.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a robot researcher, and you pick something by the root and think, "I can do this with my knowledge, let's try it"?
We try to keep these plants in the lab first before we take them outside, because we don't want to throw away what we've grown, because they're precious.
My tongue has changed – I don't want people to eat it until I'm sure it's a decent food.
So I eat lettuce every day, because the pH of lettuce can be found by an error of within 0.1.
"Oh, it's PH6.1, I can't eat it today"
The lettuce on this day was very sweet
When plants are stressed, they try to protect themselves, and there is a chemical reaction inside them, so they become very sweet, "I don't want to die."
The cry of such a plant makes it taste very sweet, which I like.
A technologist who turned to plant physiology...
I wanted to make this experiment possible for others to do
I'm curious to see what it produces, so I thought of a lab that could be delivered anywhere.
First of all, I made it
My lab is located in front of the media lab, and there are about 30 sensors attached to each plant.
If you've ever heard of genomes and genetic engineering, this is the so-called phenome.
It comes from the word "phenomenon"
For example, if you say, "I like strawberries from Mexico," you actually prefer strawberries grown in a climate that will grow to your liking.
So if you program that climate – you can use combinations of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels as recipes, program plant flavors, nutrients, size, shape, color, texture, and so on.
We need data for this, and we have a lot of sensors installed to know what's going on. Think of indoor garden plants, and when you look at this, you're going to be very sad: "Why are you dying? Talk to me."
Farmers have the best eye for predicting plant growth in their late 60s and 70s.
When plants are dying, they know it's because they don't have enough nitrogen, they don't have enough calcium, they need moisture.
This wonderful eye is not inherited.
This is data that a farmer has stored in the cloud.
Track how your data evolves over time
Correlate these data with individual plants
These are the IP addresses of broccoli in the lab on a given day
It is a broccoli that can be assigned an IP address
If you think we're not weird enough, click here to see the plant's profile.
It's downloadable data about the growth of the plants you just mentioned, probably more than you can imagine, not just when it's going to be eaten.
When you can get the nutrition you need,
Predict when you will get the taste you like
Is it overwatering?
Are you letting in too much sunlight?
It also gives a warning
He talks to me, he's intelligent, he has a common language with me.
I think I'm the first Facebook user of the plant world.
The profile of the plant and the plant begins to make friends.
Less nitrogen, more phosphorus Consume less potassium What is it with other plants?
They should be compatible, so far we can only speculate and learn the intricacies of interplant relationships as well.
Plants may not recognize us as friends – but there is a possibility, it depends on what we do.
This is my lab right now
It's a little bit more orderly than it used to be, I've got experience setting up data centers in various hospitals, and I'm a little bit more knowledgeable about creating a controlled environment.
Since then, I've been experimenting with all kinds of experiments in this environment.
This method of aeronics was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water that is carried into space.
Here, we give the plants what they need – water, minerals and oxygen – just as much as they need.
The growth of the roots is simple, just give them what they need, and they will grow beautifully like this.
It is as if the plant has two hearts
Because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a complete world
Humanity has advanced technology over the years, and we have gained seeds that can grow in harsh environments, and technological innovation continues, but now we have created new ways of doing things, and we live in a perfect world.
We have grown various types of plants
This type of tomato has not been commercially produced for 150 years.
Did you know that humanity has a rare and ancient seed bank?
It is a storage of seeds
That's great
There are some species in which the germplasm is preserved alive and no one has ever tasted it.
I'm the only one who has eaten this tomato in the lab.
The problem is that these are tomatoes for sauce, and I don't know how to cook them, so I tried tomatoes for sauce, but they don't taste good.
I tried to grow various things using proteins
Even humans – they might be able to do it, but they don't really do it.
What we've come to understand is that the equipment is large and very expensive.
I wanted to spread it all over the world, but it turned out to be a device that cost about 10 million yen
It's hard to find someone who can give you 10 million yen quickly, so I decided to make something small.
This project was actually led by one of my students, Camille, an undergraduate mechanical engineering student.
Camille, my colleagues and I experimented over the course of the summer, trying to find something cheaper, more effective, and something that anyone could make.
Then we brought this to middle school and high school.
If you want people to make fun of you, try teaching your child something.
I went to school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A 1st grade student asks, "What is humidity?"
I replied, "It's water in the air."
He retorts, "There's no water in the air, you're not stupid."
I say, "You don't have to believe me.
You don't have to believe it
Set it to 100%."
He set it to 100% – what happens?
The water aggregates and becomes a mist, and finally the water droplets fall
He said, "What, humidity means rain.
Why didn't you tell me that?"
We've created an input screen that looks like a game.
It is a three-dimensional display You can log in from anywhere in the world It can be used on a smartphone or tablet
You can control a variety of devices and sensors in your bot
You can choose a recipe made by other children around the world.
If you choose a recipe and start it, seedlings will be planted.
You can also make changes during growth.
"Why do plants need CO2? You're going to kill people."
What a word is also heard
If you increase the CO2 concentration, the plant will die.
Lowering CO2 makes plants feel very energetic.
Once you've harvested your plants, you'll have a new digital recipe.
It's a process of designing, developing, and exploring.
They can download data about new plants and new digital recipes, and the changes are: effective or reversed?
Think of these as the core of the development process
We will learn a lot
This is what we call a food computer, and it's three weeks in school.
It grows this much in 3 weeks
What's more important is that this child first thought, "I wonder if I can become a farmer," and maybe "I want to be a farmer."
So we made all the data open.
It's all online, let's build a food computer at home.
It can be a little difficult, but-
It's just the beginning, but everything is in place.
It's very important that it's easy to get it.
We will make it more familiar
They are farmers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists and urban planners.
Do what you're good at on one platform
This lab is getting cramped.
This is a new facility that I have just started using.
Warehouses like this can be found anywhere.
That's why we chose it
I'm trying to make something like this in a warehouse.
This already exists
Take a look
This is also already available
We grow green vegetables and Ebola vaccines, respectively.
One of the reasons these plants won the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Grand Challenge was that they were ahead of the curve in Ebola research, which is great.
This plant produces proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements to lettuce
It's not like lettuce at all, but that's what I'm going to study.
It's different in all respects
We're still in an early state of chaos – it's like "our black box—" "Buy me."
"No, I have a very valuable intellectual property property.
Don't do his, buy mine."
In fact, we're just getting started, and society is about to change.
They want more and less expensive food, but they also want better, more eco-friendly food.
McDonald's disclosing the contents of chicken nuggets, which were always considered the most suspicious food, shows that they are marketing to keep up with the changes in the world.
Let's take a look at the modern world
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers – operated by open phenomes.
Unlike Open Genome, ours is like a wiki with a little bit of climate recipes added to it, which you can start and grow by selecting it from a pull-down menu.
What does this endeavor look like globally?
Remember when the world was connected by a line?
First, install the oscillator.
Instead of sending the food itself, we start disseminating information about the food.
It's not just my fantasy, it's already spreading in places like this.
Food computers, food servers, and food data centers will be built to connect people by sharing information.
The food supply of the future is not about fighting the inherent shortcomings.
We know what the shortcomings are
The food of the future is a network that connects the next billion farmers, providing a platform that will allow us to pose problems and provide solutions.
Thank you very much
Sometimes I feel very sorry for myself as a European.
Over the past year, more than a million people have made it to Europe for help, and our response has been honestly lousy.
It's really full of contradictions.
Everyone mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, but since then, more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
While international agreements allow for a shared responsibility for the reception of refugees, they acquiesce to the fact that the small country of Lebanon accepts more refugees than the total number of refugees in Europe as a whole.
We deplorish the existence of smugglers, but we have made it the only route of asylum to Europe.
There is a shortage of labor, but we exclude people who meet our human resource needs economically and demographically.
In opposition to Islamic fundamentalism, they claim to be liberal, yet they have a repressive policy of detaining young asylumgoers, separating children from their families, and confiscating refugee property.
Don't you think it's funny?
Why has it become so inhumane to respond to the humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because people are indifferent, at least I don't want to believe that's the reason.
I think it's because politicians lack a vision, a vision that adapts the international refugee policy that was created more than 50 years ago to the changing age of globalization.
So I'd like to go back to the basics and ask two very fundamental questions, which are questions that we should all be thinking about.
First, why is the current system not working?
And how can we fix this?
The modern refugee system was created by these people right after World War II.
The purpose in the first place is to give people a place to go when the state collapses, or in the worst case, when the blade is turned on the people, and to give them a place to live safely and with dignity until they return.
It was designed for exactly the kind of situation we see in Syria today.
It is an international agreement signed by 147 governments — the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, an international organization, pledging to accept refugees from their territories and to accept people fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system is not working.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
The reality is that our immigration policies are blocking the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to assimilate into their homes and return to their homes.
In reality, you're stuck almost forever.
In theory, refugees share responsibilities with countries around the world.
The reality is that countries adjacent to conflict zones take on the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees due to geographical issues.
The system is not working because the rules are wrong.
It's because we're not applying the rules properly to keep up with the changing world, and we need to rethink that.
Here's how the current refugee system actually works.
Let me explain a little
But not from a top-down perspective, but from a refugee perspective.
First, imagine a Syrian woman
Let's call her Amira
She is the kind of woman who symbolizes a lot of people in the area.
Amira is a woman, like 25% of the world's refugees, and she has children. The reason why she can't go back home is because the city she lived in is like this. As you can see, Amira City, Homs, was once a beautiful and historic city, but now it's buried in rubble.
It's not a situation where you can go home
But Amira doesn't have a way to resettle in a third country, because it's like a lottery, and only 1% of the world's refugees can afford it.
So Amira and her family have to make an almost impossible choice.
There are only three basic options
The first is to bring your family to a refugee camp.
There, they can receive assistance, but the future of Amira and her family is almost non-existent.
The refugee camps are desolate and barren lands—often in the desert.
In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the sound of bullets can be heard at night on the border with Syria.
There are restrictions on economic activity.
The quality of education is also not good
And about 80% of refugees in camps around the world will be in this situation for at least five years.
Life there is miserable, maybe because of that, only 9% of Syrians actually choose this path.
Then there's the option of heading to the city, which is in a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
This is the option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
But there are also great difficulties to be faced.
Refugees usually do not have the right to work in these urban areas.
They don't get much help
In this case, Amira and her family are left with almost nothing left after they have exhausted their savings, and a life of poverty in the city.
Third option — more and more Syrians are choosing this
Seeking a handful of hopes for their families, risking their lives, embarking on a very dangerous journey to another country, is a phenomenon that we see in Europe today.
The world is confronting refugees with these impossible choices, limiting them to three options: camping, living in poverty in the city, and perilous journey.
For refugees, this is what the international refugee regime is all about.
But it's an illusion to think that this is the only way.
I think there is room for reconsideration
The reason we are limited to these options is because we think in our minds that this is the only path refugees can take, but we are wrong.
Politicians see the refugee crisis as a "zero-sum" issue—that is, if we do something for refugees, it will put a burden on the citizens.
We tend to assume that refugees are a burden or a burden on society.
On the other hand, there are ways for refugees to contribute to society.
What I'm trying to say is that there is a way for everyone to benefit from expanding the choice of refugees, the host countries, the communities, our societies, and the refugees themselves.
I think the four methods I'm going to talk about can fundamentally change the way we think about refugees.
All four have one thing in common: they take advantage of globalization, liquidity and the opportunities created by markets to change the way we look at the refugee crisis.
The first idea is to create an environment for refugees, starting with a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings just like everyone else, and they are just being put in extraordinary situations.
My colleagues at the University of Oxford and I started a survey in Uganda to look at the economic activities of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because it is the world's leading host country.
This is because we have a very good policy
Unlike other host countries around the world, Uganda has provided economic opportunities for refugees.
They gave refugees the right to work and freedom of movement.
This has been phenomenal for both refugees and refugee settlements.
In the capital, Kampala, 21 percent of the refugees had businesses and employed workers, and 40 percent of the people employed were citizens of the host country.
In other words, the refugees were creating jobs and employing the citizens of the host country.
Even in the refugee camps, there were great examples of active individual businesses.
For example, in a refugee settlement called Nakivare, Congolese refugees are involved in the business of buying and selling digital music.
A Rwandan refugee started a business to provide computer games to young people using repurposed game consoles and televisions.
Despite the harsh environment, innovative efforts are being made, and this photo is taken by a Congolese man named Demucay.
When I arrived at the settlement, I was almost penniless, but I wanted to be a filmmaker.
He started a community radio station with friends and colleagues, borrowed a video camera, and is now making videos.
I co-produced two documentaries at the request of my team, and with a small amount of money, I have succeeded in my business.
These examples should be used as a reference to determine how we respond to refugees.
Instead of seeing refugees as necessarily dependent on humanitarian aid, we need to provide them with opportunities to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothing, bedding, a place to sleep, and food are all important in an emergency, but you need to look beyond that.
Opportunities such as telecommunications, electricity, education, labour rights, access to capital and banks.
We have to provide that the benefits of the global economy are normal for us, and we can and should be able to do for refugees.
The second is the idea of economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all countries in the world that host refugees adopt the same policy as Uganda.
Most countries don't welcome refugees into their economies in the way that Uganda does.
But there are practical ideas that can be adopted.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my fellow development economist, Paul Collier, and while I was there, I brainstormed and talked with the international community and the Jordanian government in a way that was in line with Jordan's domestic development strategy.
We came up with an idea of how to give jobs to Syrians, and we explored the possibility of employing refugees together with the jobs of Jordanian citizens in the host country.
Just 15 minutes away from the Za'atari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, there is an economic zone in King Hussein bin Talal Development Zone.
The Jordanian government has invested more than $1 million to connect the area to the electricity grid and the road network, but two things are missing: labor and inward investment.
What if refugees could work here? What if you could not be confined to a camp, provide for your family, learn skills through vocational training, and then return to Syria?
I thought this would be beneficial to Jordan because Jordan's development strategy as a middle-income country requires the development of domestic manufacturing.
Not only will it be beneficial for refugees, but it will also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the conflict, and it will eventually be the best human resource to rebuild Syria – based on the recognition that refugees need to be protected and trained.
I published this proposal in the political magazine Foreign Affairs.
Caught the eye of King Abdullah
Two weeks ago, at a Syria support conference in London, it was announced that it would be piloted this summer.
The third idea I would like to propose to you is a matching system between the country and the refugees, which will lead to a happy result like this one: a Syrian refugee taking a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It's rare to ask refugees what they want or where they want to go, but it's possible for everyone to benefit from listening to refugees.
Economist Alvin Ross developed the concept of matching theory, which is to determine the final combination based on the preferences of the parties.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teitelboim explored how to apply this concept to refugees, asking them to list the places they want to host in order of preference, and at the same time, having the host country prioritize the type of refugee they want based on job skills, language, and other criteria.
Now, of course, you should consider factors such as diversity and vulnerability in the conditions of the acceptance quota, but you can also think of them as a way to increase the matching rate.
The concept of matching is well used, for example, in university slots for students, kidney donors and patients, and in the algorithms used on dating sites.
Why not incorporate this to expand refugee options?
It can also be used on a national scale, because one of the big challenges we face is convincing the local community to accept refugees.
Today, for example, in my country of England, we often do the ridiculous thing of sending engineers to the countryside and farmers to the cities.
Therefore, if you match the market, you can match the wishes of both parties and listen to the needs and desires of both the residents and the refugees.
And the fourth idea is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and disruptions happening in Europe are completely avoidable.
It's happening because of a fundamental contradiction in Europe's refugee policy, which means that in order to become an asylum seeker in Europe, you have to travel on a perilous journey and arrive unprepared, but why do you need to travel like that?
In this day and age of low-cost airlines and consular services, these trips should be completely unnecessary, but last year more than 3,000 people died at the borders of Europe and within Europe.
Quite simply, if refugees were allowed to travel to Europe normally and become asylum-seekers, the way to do this is called a humanitarian visa, where you can pick up a visa at an embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, and then you can simply pay for your own travel and travel to Europe by ferry or plane.
1,000 euros to cross from Turkey to the Greek islands with a smuggler
A cheap flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs 200 EUR
There are significant benefits to opening up these options to refugees.
Lots of lives will not be lost, the refugee smuggling industry itself will be out of business, and chaos will disappear from the front lines of Europe, such as the Greek islands.
It's not rational measures that are hindering these measures, it's policy.
This idea has actually been adopted.
Brazil pioneered this approach, with more than 2,000 Syrians entering Brazil on humanitarian visas and receiving refugee status upon arrival.
All Syrians who have taken advantage of this system have obtained refugee status and have been officially granted refugee status.
There are also historical precedents
Between 1922 and 1942, 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens used their Nansen passports as international identification documents to move through Europe and seek asylum in other European countries.
Nansen International Refugee Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its pragmatic strategy.
All four of the ideas I've just talked about are ways to increase the options for the temporary refugee Amira that I mentioned at the beginning.
It's a way to broaden the range of options for refugees, so you don't have to limit yourself to the three impossible options that I talked about at the beginning, and yet other people will benefit.
In conclusion, we desperately need a new vision, one that expands refugee options but understands that it doesn't have to be a burden.
The notion that refugees are inevitably a burden is wrong
Although it is a humanitarian duty, refugees are skilled, talented, and motivated human beings who have the power to contribute to society if they are provided with the opportunity.
In the future, there will be no end to the number of people who will migrate in the world.
What is happening in Europe will continue for years to come.
Refugees continue to move and wander in search of a place to belong, and we should look for rational and realistic ways to deal with this situation—not based on old theories of humanitarian aid or philanthropy, but on how to take advantage of the opportunities created by globalization and market liquidity.
I would like to appeal to all of you and to all the politicians to wake up and face this issue.
Thank you very much
Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the sea
It's a wonderful place full of color and life, home to strange alien-like creatures.
I imagined a large shark dominating the food chain, or a graceful sea turtle swimming across a coral reef.
I'm a marine biologist-turned-photographer, so I've dedicated most of my work to finding the magical places I dreamed of when I was little.
As you can see, I've been exploring underwater since I was pretty young.
But the first time I really went underwater was when I was about 10 years old.
I still vividly remember swimming furiously, trying to touch an old cannon on a shallow coral.
And when I finally got it, I looked up and I was instantly surrounded by colorful fish, and that was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschuk Conservation Photographer After 40 years of living on Earth, I have had the rare opportunity to explore the wonders of the ocean for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've photographed everything, from the incredibly big sharks to the adorable ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
Off the coast of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, I witnessed a humpback whale with very fishy breath feeding just 30 centimeters away.
I've also been present at the mating of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Every person and ocean on the planet has influenced each other.
And the untouched oceans that I dreamed of when I was a kid are getting harder and harder to find.
They're being cornered and threatened.
Humanity has always been the main hunter on the planet, and I have witnessed and photographed its effects firsthand.
For a long time, I wanted to get people interested by shocking them with shocking photos.
There are advantages to this approach, but I have gone back to the basics.
I thought that the best way to make a difference was to appeal to love.
Maybe I'm a matchmaker of sorts, as a photographer, and I've had a rare opportunity to uncover the whole of animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the surface of the ocean.
If you don't know it exists, you can't cherish it, you can't defend it.
Revealing the hidden is the power of conservation photography.
I've visited hundreds of ocean areas, but there are a few that have impressed me deeply.
The first time I experienced such excitement was 10 years ago, off the rocky, untamed coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, huge herds of sardines make a great migration northward called the Sardine Run.
There's a good reason for this.
This is because the hungry and swift catchers are secretly chasing them with great vigor.
In general, dolphins hunt in groups and separate some sardines from the herd to form a spherical school called a bait ball.
Drive the fish to the surface of the sea and become part of this living and moving feast.
There is a shark right behind
Many people believe that dolphins and sharks are natural enemies, but they actually coexist during the Sardine Run.
Dolphins help sharks feed efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait balls would be more dispersed, and the sharks would be stuck in so-called sardines doughnuts, with their mouths full of water and nothing to gain.
Now, I've had some exciting moments with sharks on the Sardine Run, and I know they don't see me as bait.
But in this wild banquet, like the other fish, they are bumped and beaten with fins.
Moving east from the coast of Africa across the vast Indian Ocean, you end up in the Maldives Islands, which are made of coral.
During the intense southwest monsoon season, manta rays come from all over the archipelago to a very small part of Baa Atoll called Hanifaru, and a large number of crustaceans, usually smaller than a human eye, are the staple food of manta rays.
When the plankton is unevenly located, manta rays feed alone and do somersaults backwards many times, just like puppies chasing their own tails.
However, when plankton is concentrated in one place, the rays line up and form a long chain for feeding, and even if the rays near the front of the stingray miss a little plankton, the subsequent rays will surely swallow it.
As the amount of plankton increases, the rays swim closer to each other, and this unique behavior is called cyclone feeding.
The stingrays circle in a solid formation, forming a multi-tiered cylinder, creating a vortex to collect plankton, suck it in, and carry it to its own cavernous mouth.
The experience of diving surrounded by hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
When we first filmed in Hanifal, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like the Manta Trust helped Hanifaru eventually become a marine protected area.
Fishermen on the neighboring islands used to catch rays to make traditional drums out of stingray skins.
Today, they're more committed to conservation than anyone else, and they're making $8 million more each year in the Maldives thanks to rays.
I've always wanted to go back in time and go back to a time when the map was almost blank or it said "here's the dragon."
The closest I went to the sea during that period was the atoll on the west side of the Indian Ocean.
Diving into these waters, far away from sea lanes and fishing fleets, gives you a keen sense of what the sea used to look like
Most people have never heard of a small coral reef in the Mozambique Strait called Vasas da India.
The coral reef is a barrier, and the lagoon inside is a breeding ground for Galapagos sharks.
This shark is not very timid, even during the day.
I had a hunch that at night I would be bolder and come out a lot more
Have you ever encountered so many sharks in a single coral outcrop?
Capturing and sharing these moments reminds me of why I went down this path.
Earlier this year, I did work on National Geographic on the Baja California Peninsula.
About halfway along the Pacific side of the peninsula is San Ignacio Lagoon, an important breeding ground for gray whales.
This coast was a place where mass murder lasted for 100 years, with more than 20,000 gray whales killed and only a few hundred surviving.
Today, the whale's descendants gently push their children to the surface of the ocean to play and even interact with us.
This species has made a truly amazing comeback
Now, on the other side of the peninsula is a quiet fishing town called Cabo Pulmo.
It was on the verge of collapse due to decades of overfishing.
In 1995, local fishermen appealed for the area to be designated as a marine protected area.
What happened after that was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, despite only 10 years of conservation, fish numbers saw an unprecedented recovery.
But see for yourself, let's go together.
Take a breath, dive deeper, and swim into the biggest, densest school of fish I've ever encountered.
Everyone can give birth to hope
Through my photos, I want to tell you that it's not too late to protect our oceans.
We want to focus on nature's resilience, especially in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, if you don't look very closely, you won't be able to take photos like this, and you will be able to take photos that will serve as a model of coexistence with the sea.
We can only hope that it will become a daily occurrence
In order to survive and advance in my profession, I have to be a helpless optimist.
I'm always working under assumptions, and I think that the great pictures that inspire change are right around the corner there, beyond the coral there, in that lagoon, or even beyond.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's health policy.
At the end of a long war of independence, a new government came along, immediately proclaiming socialist policies, and health services, primary education, etc., were basically free.
We have greatly increased the number of local medical facilities, and about 80% of the population can reach medical facilities within a two-hour walk.
In 1980, when Zimbabwe gained independence, the vaccination rate for children in the country was 25%.
Just 10 years later, in 1990, it reached 80%
I was really proud to be a part of this revolution.
The excitement and solidarity of the people was palpable.
I felt like I was part of not only the African independence movement, but the world's leading public health movement, standing shoulder to shoulder with some of the most talented local scientists, doctors, and activists.
But there was a terrible problem.
The year I arrived, in 1985, Zimbabwe's first AIDS case was reported
I had seen some AIDS patients at Harlem General Hospital, where I was a resident in the early '80s, but I had no idea what was approaching Africa.
In the early days of my stay, the HIV infection rate was about 2%
It skyrocketed, and one in four adults was infected, 17 years after I left Harare.
By the mid-90s, I had told hundreds of people in their prime that I was HIV positive.
I have witnessed the deaths of colleagues and friends, and I have witnessed the deaths of students and patients.
In response, I set up a clinic with my colleagues.
Demonstrating how to use condoms
Start sex education at school or at work.
Conduct case studies and instruct the partners of infected people on how to prevent it.
I worked hard, and at the time I thought I was doing my best.
I thought I was doing an excellent job, even though in retrospect it was lousy.
But they didn't call for structural reforms.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan candidly says his blunders led to genocide in Rwanda
He said he was the UN Secretary-General of peacekeeping operations in 1994, when the massacre occurred.
Speaking at a memorial service on the 10th anniversary of the massacre, he recalled, "At the time, I was convinced that I was doing the best I could, but then the massacre happened, and I realized that there was more that could have been done, that there was more that needed to be done, that there was something that needed to be done to sound the alarm and get cooperation."
The AIDS pandemic caught the medical community off guard, and the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from AIDS so far, so I'm not the only one who regrets that we should have acted sooner.
But during my stay in Zimbabwe, I didn't put myself in a position to advocate for change or a political position.
I came here as a clinician and as an epidemiologist to put my professional skills to good use.
In my mind, I thought my role was to take care of patients, conduct research, and gain a better understanding of the infection patterns of the population, so that I could stop the spread of this virus.
I was aware that the risk of developing AIDS and dying was high due to the disproportionate social disadvantage.
In a sugar cane plantation, which resembles a feudal manor more than any modern corporate organization, 60% of pregnant women were HIV positive.
I taught them that just because they are infected does not mean that they are, but rather that they are a product of a male-dominated culture, forced seasonal work, and colonialism.
The white population was hardly affected.
As health care professionals, we were painfully helpless, begging to change our behavior, to use condoms, to have less sex.
Infection rates were only going up, and treatments were being developed in the West—still the most effective treatment for AIDS, but they were out of reach for any public sector across Africa.
I was silent about the lack of equal access to life-saving medicines, and I didn't say anything about the political and economic systems that underlie the AIDS epidemic — the system that caused such a massive outbreak.
I justified my silence by saying to myself, "I'm not a resident of this country, and if I sound the alarm, I could even be deported, I won't be able to do my job, I won't be able to see patients, I won't be able to do the research that is needed."
So I kept silent and didn't give an opinion on the government's policy on AIDS at the time.
Didn't adequately assert their concerns
Many doctors and health care professionals will think that I was not at fault.
The Hippocratic Oath and its other versions set forth the sacredness of the relationship between doctor and patient.
I did everything I could, and I did the best I could for every single one of my patients.
But I realized that such an outbreak was a reflection of social distortions, not only because of biological causes, but rather because of practices that marginalized, excluded and discriminated against the vulnerable, such as discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, social class, etc.
AIDS is one of them.
The same was true of the recent Ebola
Medical anthropologists, such as Paul Farmer, who has been working on the fight against AIDS in Haiti, call this "structural violence." We call it "structural" because inequality is embedded in the political and economic fabric of our societies, and it is often invisible to those with privilege and power. We call it "violence" because: In other words, this phenomenon brings— death and suffering at a young age, And because the disease is violent.
If we want to help patients in any way we can, we must be aware of these social inequalities.
Calling attention is the first step to making public health work, so that we can gather collaborators, pave the way together, and make real change.
That's why I'm not silent these days.
I say a lot of things, even when I feel uncomfortable with my listeners, even when I'm uncomfortable speaking up.
A lot of the time it's about racial inequality, institutionalized racism, and things that shouldn't be allowed in this country anymore, let alone in health care and public health.
Because of its existence, people are losing their lives without living out their lives.
That's why it's central to my mission as New York City Health Commissioner to sound the alarm — about racism in American health care and the ongoing systemic and interpersonal violence — about the violence that people of color are subjected to, including 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow system, and 60 years of violence exacerbated by imperfect equality.
The premature mortality rate for people under age 65 is 50 percent higher for black men than for white men in New York City.
In 2012, maternal mortality rates for black women were more than 10 times higher than for white women.
Infant survival has improved dramatically, but black infants are still nearly three times more likely to die in the first year of life than white infants.
New York isn't the only thing special
Similar statistics can be found anywhere in the United States.
According to a recent New York Times analysis, there are 1.5 million black men in the United States.
According to the article, more than one in six black men between the ages of 25 and 54 disappear from everyday life today, either in prison or at a young age.
There's a gross injustice that happens every day, only young black men, unjustified violence #BlackLivesMatterとして知られる violence that is the subject of protest.
But it's important to remember that the occurrence of common diseases and their consequences — such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS, which have different incidence rates but continue to occur, are slow, quiet, and dying prematurely, and black people are dying more from these diseases.
#BlackLivesMatter運動が When it started, I was frustrated and angry because the medical community has avoided even using the word "racism" in research and work.
Every time I use this word, I'm sure you've had something on your mind.
In spite of the medical students who were protesting in white coats dressed as corpses, most people in the medical community stood idly by and watched the discrimination that still remains, even though it continues to affect the appearance of the disease and the mortality rate. I'm worried that
The modern trend toward personalized medicine and precision medicine is to seek more personalized treatments, to inadvertently lose sight of the big picture in the pursuit of biological and genetic research, and to the everyday environment — where people live, grow, work, and love each other — is the one that has the greatest impact on people's health and harms the health of too many people.
As health professionals, we witness gross injustice in our daily work, in our clinics and in our research. Homeless people can't follow their doctors' guidance because they have more pressing priorities. Transgender youth contemplating suicide because of a society that is so inconsiderate, and single mothers are responsible for their children's health.
As health care professionals, the role of physicians is not just to see patients, but to be an advocate for attention and change.
Doctors, regardless of their legitimacy, have a lot of weight in their statements, because of their social status, and they shouldn't let it go to waste.
I regret not speaking out in Zimbabwe, and I have made a vow to myself, and as the New York City Director of Health, I will use every opportunity I have to raise awareness and help improve health disparities.
We will stand up to racism, and we need your help, and when you stand up to gender discrimination, I will be a force to be reckoned with, and I will be a force to be reckoned with about any other form of inequality.
It's time for us to stand up and collectively speak out against structural inequalities.
You don't have to know all the answers to call for change
It just takes courage.
The health of our patients and the health of all of us depend on it.
I'd like to ask you to raise your hand, have you ever unfriended someone on Facebook? Because the person has made some offensive remarks about politics, religion, parenting, and food.
Who has at least one person who doesn't want to talk and avoids you?
In the past, in order to have a polite conversation, you just had to follow Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady and talk about the weather and health.
Lately, with things like climate change and anti-vaccination — it's not a safe topic anymore.
In the world we live in, every conversation can turn into a controversy, politicians can't talk to each other, and there are people who argue for and against even the most trivial issues, which is not normal.
The Pew Research Center surveyed 10,000 American adults and found that people are now more polarized and confrontational than ever before in history.
They don't want to compromise and they don't listen.
And we decide where to live, who to marry, and who to be friends with, based on what we already believe.
This also means not listening.
Conversation needs a balance between speaking and listening, and we've lost that balance somewhere.
The development of technology is also a factor
Your phone is still in your hand or within reach.
According to the Pew Research Center, one-third of teens send more than 100 messages a day.
Most of them probably do more to message than to talk face-to-face.
In The Atlantic Magazine
There's an interesting article written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
He gave his students a communication assignment
I wanted to teach them how to talk about a specific subject without using notes.
He writes that "I noticed—"
"Conversational ability is one of the most overlooked skills that teachers fail to teach.
Students spend hours every day interacting with ideas and other people through screens, but they have few opportunities to hone their interpersonal skills.
It may sound strange, but we have to ask ourselves, what skill in the 21st century is more important than the ability to have a coherent and confident conversation?"
I make speaking my job Nobel Prize winners Truck drivers Billionaires Kindergarten teachers Heads of state Plumbers
Talk to people you like and people you don't like
Personally, I talk to people I don't agree with at all.
Still, you can have a great conversation with them.
In the next 10 minutes, I'll teach you how to speak and how to listen.
You've probably heard a lot about conversation secrets, such as looking the other person in the eye, thinking about a topic that interests you in advance, showing that you're listening carefully, looking at the other person, wrestling, smiling, repeating the other person's words, or summarizing them.
Forget all that.
It's not useful
You don't have to learn how to make it look like you're listening carefully, if you're actually paying attention.
I use the skills of a professional interviewer in my daily life.
I'm going to teach you the art of interviewing, but it's also going to help you get better at conversation, and learn how to have a conversation that doesn't waste each other's time, doesn't get bored, doesn't hurt the other person.
We've all had great conversations.
I know what it's like
It's the kind of conversation that draws you in, inspires you, makes you feel like you've made a real connection with the other person, that you've been fully understood, and that you've broken up
There's no reason why most of the conversations shouldn't be like that.
Let's go through the 10 basic rules of conversation together, and if you master even one of them, you'll be able to enjoy better conversations.
No. 1 "Don't do 'while'"
It's not just about stopping playing with your phone, tablet, or car keys.
It's about being there, body and soul.
Try to be in the moment.
Don't even think about an argument with your boss
Don't even think about what you're going to have for dinner.
If you want to leave the conversation, please leave, but don't participate only halfway.
No. 2 "Don't talk one-sidedly"
If you want to assert your opinion without any reactions, arguments, counter-arguments, or opportunities for growth, then write a blog.
The reason I don't put people on my show who speak dogmatically is because it's boring.
If you're a conservative, you hate Obama, food stamps, and abortion.
If you're a liberal, you don't like big banks, oil companies, or Dick Cheney.
I know what I'm saying.
It's not going to be like that
You need to approach the conversation with the attitude that there is something to be learned.
Renowned therapist M. Scott Peck once said, "You need to put yourself aside in order to really listen."
This means that sometimes you need to put your opinions aside.
"When you feel accepted, you feel less vulnerable, and you show the listener what is deep in your heart."
Again, let's approach it with a learning attitude.
As Bill Nighy says, "Everyone you meet knows something you don't."
I would say, "Anyone is an expert in something."
No. 3: Ask open-ended questions
Emulate journalists
I ask questions that start with when/where/who/what/why/how
If you ask a complex question, you'll only get a simple answer.
If you ask, "Were you scared?"
React to the most striking words in the question, in this case "I was scared" and the answer is "yes" or "no."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let the other person explain, because it's the other side that knows.
I ask questions like, "How was it?"
"How did you feel?"
Then they will have to stop and think, and they will come up with a much more interesting answer.
No. 4 "Go with the flow"
The thoughts that come to your mind have to go out
You've often heard interviews like this, where after a guest has spoken for minutes, the moderator's questions are completely irrelevant or have been answered before.
The moderator must have stopped listening two minutes ago, and he came up with some clever question and decided that he had to say it.
We're doing exactly the same thing
I remember sitting down with someone and talking to them and running into actor Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
And stop listening
Stories and ideas come to mind.
Just let it float and disappear
No. 5: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People who appear on the radio, especially in the case of NPR, know that what they say will be recorded, so they are very careful when they say that they are an expert on something, or that they know something for sure.
You should do the same, just be too careful.
Don't make the story cheesy.
No. 6: Don't equate the other person's experience with your own.
Don't bring up the story of your own loss when the other person is talking about losing a family member.
When the other person is talking about problems at work, don't tell them how much you hate your job.
The other person's experience and yours are completely different.
Every experience is individual.
More importantly, you're not talking about yourself.
You don't have to take the opportunity to show how great you are or how needy you are.
Stephen Hawking was asked about his IQ and replied, "Come on, bragging about your IQ is what a loser does."
Conversation is not an opportunity to self-promote [Conversation in the 21st Century]
"How are you doing today?" "Look at the blog! No. 7: Don't say the same thing over and over again.
I'm tired of being condescending, but everyone tends to do it.
Especially in conversations at work and with children, they change words and repeat themselves to show that their arguments are correct.
Don't do it
No. 8 "Don't get hung up on the details"
Frankly, they don't care about the details, like the year, the name, or the date, even though you may be having a hard time remembering.
The other person is not interested What they are interested in is about you
Who are you and what do you have in common?
So let's forget about the details and not need
Number 9: This isn't the last, but it's the most important thing.
"Listening"
I don't know how many great people have said this, but listening is the most important skill that anyone can develop.
It's a little paraphrase of the Buddha: "When your mouth is open, you don't learn anything."
According to the notoriously taciturn president, Calvin Coolidge, "No one has ever been fired for listening."
Why don't we ask each other?
For one thing, I want to talk rather than listen.
When you're talking, you're in control.
You don't have to ask what you're not interested in.
Be the center of attention
You can strengthen your identity
But there are other reasons for this, because it distracts attention.
The average person speaks 225 words per minute, but we can hear up to 500 words per minute.
Our consciousness is trying to fill the remaining 275 words.
It certainly takes effort and energy to keep the other person's attention, but if you can't do that, you're not having a conversation.
It's just two people in the same place shouting irrelevant words at each other
We have to listen to each other
Writer Stephen Covey puts it up brilliantly.
"A lot of people don't listen to try to understand.
I'm asking you to answer."
There is one more rule, number 10, "Be concise."
[My sister says, "A good conversation is like a miniskirt, short enough to get people interested, but long enough to cover the bottom line."] (Applause) Everything I've said so far can be summed up in one thing: being interested in the other person.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and it was a tradition in my house.
A lot of people would come to talk to my grandparents, and after the customers would leave, my mom would come and ask, "Do you know who that person is?"
She's Associate Miss America
He's the mayor of Sacramento.
She is a Pulitzer Prize winner and he is a dancer in the Russian Ballet
So I thought everybody had something hidden and amazing.
I've come to believe that this is what makes me a good moderator.
I keep my mouth shut as much as I can, I open my mind, and I hope to be impressed, and I've never been disappointed by it.
Please do the same
Go out and talk to people, listen to them, and most importantly, expect to be impressed.
Thank you for your attention
Hello
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I've won medals in three sports competitions in Canada, I've participated in world-class basketball competitions, and I've had the honor of representing Canada at the World Championships.
Five days a week, I go to basketball and speed skating practice, and the top coaches and mental performance consultants help me to be the best I can be in the game.
By the way, this is all about the Special Olympics.
Does that change the way you look at me and my achievements?
The world doesn't necessarily see people like me as champions.
Until recently, people like me were marginalized and didn't go out in public.
A lot has changed since the Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider world.
People don't think it's a bad thing to use discriminatory terms in front of me.
They use the term "retarded" pejoratively.
They don't think about how much it hurts me or my friends.
Don't think I'm here to be the object of pity.
I'm here because there are still serious problems with the way the world views people with intellectual disabilities, and in too many cases, the problem is that they don't see anything.
Did you know that there was a world championship this year?
I was one of 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities who came to LA to compete.
More than 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony and sports television networks TSN and ESPN broadcast it live.
You didn't know about such a tournament, did you?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
It's a challenge to you, can you see us as equals?
The Special Olympics will transform the identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the values of all who watch them.
For those of you who don't know, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It's not the same as the Paralympics or the Olympics
High-level sports competitions are held for people with intellectual disabilities throughout the year, and the lives and values of those involved change.
It changed my life and the lives of so many other people.
And seeing people with intellectual disabilities has changed the public eye.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability
I played hockey from a young age until I was 12 years old
As I grew older, it became more and more difficult to keep up with everyone, and it was frustrating and infuriating.
I was completely out of the sport for a while, I didn't have many friends, and I felt left out, which made me sad.
In the past, people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought that I could participate in sports, let alone be a valuable member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, studied the effects of regular exercise on the motor skills of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using a strictly scientific research method, Dr. Hayden and other researchers have come to the conclusion that "children with intellectual disabilities have low motor skills simply because they lack opportunities to participate in exercise."
For people with intellectual disabilities, participation in athletic programs and sports competitions is beneficial.
Not many people believed it, but the pioneers—Dr. Hayden and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Schreiber—didn't give up, and the athletes proved them right more than 4.5 million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was anxious, because I was young, shy, I didn't have confidence, and I didn't have many friends.
But when I went there, everybody encouraged me and supported me, and I was able to be myself without worrying about what people thought of me.
Now I'm a basketball and speed skater, I've competed in state and national competitions, and this year I competed in the summer world championships in Los Angeles, and I was part of the basketball team that made it to the world championships for the first time as a Canadian representative.
I'm one of more than 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I've heard a lot of similar stories.
By being a Special Olympics athlete, we regain our pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also caters to the health needs that are important to athletes
Studies have shown that men with intellectual disabilities live 13 years less than healthy people, and women live 20 years less.
But you can stay healthy by exercising and participating in competitions at the Special Olympics.
The coaches will also teach you about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics offers free health screenings for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctors or who have difficulty accessing medical care.
At the 2015 Summer World Championships, Team Canada played against a basketball team from Nigeria.
The day before the match, the Nigerian team underwent a medical examination at the venue, and seven of the 10 members were provided with free hearing aids, which allowed them to hear clearly for the first time in their lives.
(Applause) There has been an incredible change in the players.
I was more alive and enjoying the game, I was playing with confidence, and I was able to communicate with my coach in my own voice.
The emotions were running high, because I was able to hear the sound of the ball, and the sound of the whistle and the cheers of the fans in the stands, which was a natural sound for everybody.
Special Olympics athletes are not only in competition.
Life outside the playing field will also change
According to a survey published this year, nearly half of U.S. adults don't know anyone with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans have a very low tolerance and a very negative view of people with disabilities.
In addition, the high use of discriminatory language is evidence that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to so many people.
Everyone uses it as a casual expression or a derogatory word
The phrase "retarded" was tweeted more than 9 million times last year, but it's a word that hurts me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world.
I don't think anyone thinks it's an insult, but that's a mistake.
My colleague John Franklin Stephens of Global Messenger wrote an open letter addressed to a political commentator who denigrated people with discriminatory language: "Come to the Special Olympics someday.
See if you can go home unmoved."
At the 2015 Summer World Championships, people lined up for hours to watch the final day of the weightlifting competition.
With everyone standing in the crowd, my teammate Jackie Barrett, aka "The Great Deer of Newfoundland," lifted 297 kg in a deadlift and 277 kg in a squat – (applause) and broke the Special Olympics record by a wide margin
Jackie is the record holder in weightlifting in Newfoundland, not just at the Special Olympics, but of all weightlifters.
He became a big star in LA, and the ESPN station tweeted his new record live, and he was impressed by Jackie's performance.
Fifty years ago, almost no one thought that a person with intellectual disabilities could do such a thing.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games and to cheer on athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were cheered on and honored.
Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud
It teaches people in the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve to be respected and accepted.
I have a track record and a dream in competition, I have a great coach, I have respect and dignity, I am healthier than before, and I want to be a personal trainer.
I'm not hiding or being bullied anymore, I'm giving a TED talk here and now.
(Applause) Thanks to the Special Olympics, the world has changed, but we still have a long way to go.
The next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, look at their abilities.
If you see someone using discriminatory words, please tell me how bad they are.
And I want you to think about being involved in the Special Olympics.
(Applause) Finally, I would like to say a few words
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The Special Olympics are truly changing the world, allowing 4.5 million athletes to be reborn, to be confident, to make friends, to feel like champions, to actually become champions.
Thank you very much
Kenema in Sierra Leone Alua in Nigeria Have you ever heard of such a place name?
It's the most unique place for me.
In the local hospital, nurses, doctors, and scientists have been quietly battling one of humanity's most terrible enemies for years: the Lassa virus.
Lassa virus is very similar to the Ebola virus.
It causes high fever and can sometimes be fatal.
But they protect us all by protecting the people in the local community every day, even though their lives are at risk.
But when I visited there many years ago, the most surprising thing was that they started their days on the front lines every morning by singing a song.
Everyone gathers to express their joy.
It shows vitality
Over the years, we've been visiting each other, we've been getting together, we've been singing, we've been writing songs, and it's really fun, because we're not there just to pursue science, we're communicating with each other through human love.
You can imagine that it will become very important and indispensable as the situation changes.
In March 2014, that changed a lot, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, which occurred near the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
We are afraid.
In fact, for a while, I thought that Lassa and Ebola were more prevalent than thought, and that they might reach Kenema one day.
So my team members immediately acted and joined Dr. Humar Khan's team, so we had a highly sensitive viral RNA detector ready to detect Ebola when it crossed the border and reached Sierra Leone.
We had already used such a device to anti-virus Lassa, so we knew how to do it, and the team was very good.
All they had to do was provide them with the tools and a place to test for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has come
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the maternity ward of a hospital, and the team tested for viral RNA and confirmed the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
Their work was extremely admirable
We immediately identified the case, treated the patient safely, and initiated contact tracing to understand the situation.
This could have stopped the spread of the disease earlier
But by that time, the outbreak had already been going on for months.
Hundreds of cases have occurred, surpassing previous outbreaks.
When we got to Sierra Leone, it wasn't just one case anymore, it was a tsunami.
We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health and the Kenema government to combat this epidemic, and the next week we had 31 cases, then 92, then 147 cases – all of them flowing into Kenema because there are limited facilities in Sierra Leone that can handle the disease.
We did everything we could, 24 hours a day, to save patients, to bring them to attention, and to do one more simple thing.
Of course, the patient's blood sample that was taken to detect Ebola was discarded.
Instead, they inactivated the virus with chemicals, packed blood samples in boxes, and sent them across the ocean to other research facilities.
I sent my team to Boston.
Then I worked day and night, working shifts every day, and quickly analyzed 99 Ebola virus genoms.
The virus dinom is the blueprint for that.
Ginom is something that everyone has.
It expresses the nature of everything that makes us who we are, and it contains a huge amount of information.
The result of such a task is simple but very powerful.
By observing and comparing these 99 viruses and comparing them to the three dinomes previously announced in Guinea, we were able to figure out that the outbreak started in Guinea many months ago, first transmitting humans, and then spreading through humans.
This is very important to figure out how to intervene, but then it's important to have contact tracing.
We have confirmed that the virus mutates as it transmits between humans.
It's very important to observe each of these mutations, because the diagnostic equipment, the vaccines, the treatments, all of these things are basically based on the dinome sequence.
Global health professionals need to roll out a response to this and recalibrate all the work that has been done so far.
At that time, how I worked as a scientist was to accumulate data at hand, stay in the lab for months and months, analyze the data carefully and carefully, go back and forth several times to publish a research paper, and when the paper was finally published, I would publish the data.
This is the current state of the flow of scientists' research.
But you couldn't do that, could you?
Our friends were on the front lines, and what was very clear was that they needed help, and they needed a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was after the dinome sequence was read, and we immediately published it on our website.
I just sent the data out to the world and said, "Please help me."
And the help came
In no time at all, people from all over the world were contacted by people who were surprised to see the data being published.
One of the world's best virus tracking teams suddenly joins us.
We started working together virtually, and we continued to exchange phone calls and emails, tracking the virus minute by minute, and figuring out how to stop the spread of the virus.
There are many ways to create a community in such an emergency.
Especially when the outbreak began to spread on a global scale, everyone was willing to investigate, get involved, and help.
Everyone wanted to be involved
The ability of people all over the world is really amazing, and the internet connects us all.
Imagine seeing each other as a threat and avoiding each other, rather than saying, "Let's do this."
They say, "Let's work together to solve this."
The problem was that the data we were all using was very limited and insufficient, based on what we searched for on the Internet.
In such a case, so many possibilities and opportunities are lost.
In the early days of the Kenema pandemic, we had 106 medical records that we decided to share with the world.
And in our laboratory, we were able to prove that we can predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with almost 100% accuracy by training computers from those 106 cases.
We've created an app to provide it, but it's effective enough, and to demonstrate it.
106 was not enough at all, and we were waiting for more data to come before the release.
But the data didn't come easily.
Everybody was researching and thinking and waiting, but we were all stuck in silos and not using the power of cooperation.
But this is not possible.
Don't you think so? I'm sure you'd agree
Our lives are at stake
In fact, many lives have been lost in the medical profession, including five of my dear colleagues: Bal Fony, Alex Mogboy, Dr. Humma Khan, Alice Coboma and Mohamed Fuller.
They were five of a large number of medical personnel who died in and around Kenema and we were silently working separately while the world was waiting.
Ebola, like the rest of humanity, is exacerbated by suspicion, foot-dragging, and discord.
When we build walls between each other and fight each other, the virus grows in power.
But unlike other natural threats, the fight against Ebola is equally relevant to all of us.
We're fighting together
If one person gets Ebola, it may quickly spread to someone else.
Today, our lives are just as fragile, we have the same vitality, we have the same fears and hopes, and I hope we can work together with joy
One of my graduate students read a book about Sierra Leone and learned that the word "Kenema," which is the name of the city where the hospital where we work, is actually a language of the Mende people of Sierra Leone, which means "as clear as a river, transparent to everyone."
It made a lot of sense to me, because even before I knew it, we always respected the people of Kenema and tried to share information and work together in an open environment.
That's important
When an outbreak occurs, we need to share information with ourselves and everyone around us in order to fight it together.
This is by no means the first Ebola outbreak, nor will it be the last, and there are still many other microorganisms lurking, such as the Lassa virus.
And the next time there is an outbreak, it could happen in a big city with millions of people.
It may be an airborne virus
The virus may be spread intentionally
It's very scary, and it's natural, but at the same time, what this experience has taught us is that we have the technology and the ability to overcome it, that we can win the battle against the virus, that we can gain the upper hand.
But it will only be possible if we work together, and with joy, let's do so.
Dr. Khan who died in the fight against the epidemic, and those who lost their lives on the front lines, they have been fighting with us for a long time, and we will continue to fight this battle with them.
Let's light up the world with the cooperation of billions of warm hearts and compassion so that the world will not be swayed by the destruction of a single virus.
Thank you very much
