Rabies cases on the rise in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Tawichai of the 9th Disease Prevention and Control Office said on February 9 that rabies infections have been increasing in northeastern Thailand over the past few months, with a total of 74 cases.
So far this fiscal year (October last year to September this year), 74 people have tested positive for rabies, including 67 in the northeastern provinces of Surin and seven in Buriram.
All of them had previously received the rabies vaccine.
He urged people to get rabies vaccinations, along with their pets, and to avoid contact with the saliva of animals suspected to be infected.
Rabies can be transmitted to humans not only from dogs but also from cats and bats.
Once a person becomes infected and develops symptoms, there is an almost 100% chance of death, but death can be prevented by receiving a vaccination before symptoms appear.

Located in the mountains, Pak Chung Farm in Gyeongseong County, North Hamgyong Province, has fields with steep slopes and poor soil.
Farms like this had unusually high yields last year.
▼The contribution of the Chongjin Central Zoo Feed Assurance Fisheries Facility is great.
The facility was established in 2011 with the mission of sending aquatic products for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While exceeding its fishing plan, in recent years the organization has also been supporting farms in Chongjin by procuring agricultural supplies.
However, this time the company was supporting a farm not in Chongjin city, but in Gyeongseong county, adjacent to the city.
Moreover, he decided to help with the &quot;division&quot; of Park Chung Farm, which is said to have the toughest conditions in the county.

FUJI develops system to prevent accidents involving abandoned vehicles, tests on company vehicles | Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information for Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka
Fuji (headquartered in Chiryu City), a manufacturer and seller of electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has begun developing a system to prevent people from being left behind, such as children being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed inside the car, and when it detects human movement, a notification is sent via phone or chat.
The company is currently conducting demonstration experiments using shuttle vehicles at its own facilities.
We protect the safety of children amid tragic accidents caused by abandonment.
The company is currently conducting a demonstration experiment using two shuttle vehicles for &quot;teracoya THANK,&quot; an English conversation after-school program for children that the company operates in Chiryu City.
Motion sensors that detect human movement based on the temperature difference between the person and the surrounding area are installed in three places on the ceiling of the vehicle.
If the vehicle&#39;s engine is turned off and the doors are closed, and human movement is detected after a certain period of time has passed, a warning notification will be automatically sent.
By linking information to the condition of the engine and doors, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent via the cloud.
In addition to calling pre-registered numbers, the message will also be displayed in chat on your computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered to prevent mistakes such as overlooking an address.
The demonstration experiment is scheduled to continue until the end of February.
Kamiya Kazumitsu, section chief of the Innovation Promotion Department&#39;s Second Section, pointed out that &quot;during the experiment, we also came to see issues surrounding the system.&quot;
For example, they were able to identify various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
&quot;I hope we can spread the solutions,&quot; he says with emphasis.
The impetus for developing the system to prevent children being left behind came in the wake of a series of accidents involving children being left behind on shuttle buses across the country.
An employee with young children suggested that they wonder if there was anything that could be done to ensure the safety of children.
The company decided to develop this product in order to utilize the know-how it has gained through its FA (factory automation)-related business, including IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors.
Fuji&#39;s abandonment prevention system is marketed as being easy to use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since the system can be easily retrofitted to shuttle vehicles, the aim is to lower the barrier to adoption and promote its widespread use.
In the future, we will consider commercializing the product with the cooperation of daycare centers and kindergartens.
[Editorial] The start of construction on the Hokuriku Shinkansen line between Tsuruga and Shin-Osaka, which was scheduled for early fiscal 2023, has been postponed, and this is beginning to have an impact on urban development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Obama City, where the new station will be built, the exact location of the station has yet to be disclosed, and urban planning, including surrounding development, is at a standstill.
It is expected to take a long time to formulate the plan, so it is necessary to announce it as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned for Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency indicated that the approximate location of the station would be within a radius of approximately 2.5 kilometers from JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The goal was to finalize the exact station locations and route by winter 2022.
In Obama City, projects related to the Shinkansen will begin in earnest in fiscal 2021, with an eye on the opening of Tsuruga and then Obama.
The initial budget for fiscal 2022 calls for further increasing the number of projects and promoting urban development in anticipation of announcing the location of the new station.
However, the exact location of the new station has yet to be revealed.
The city has included 3 million yen in this year&#39;s budget for a project to consider land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station and to formulate a basic plan, but this is not expected to be spent.
Urban planning centered around the new station &quot;will take time to build consensus among citizens,&quot; according to a city official.
There is an example in Echizen City of a new suburban station being built within the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it appears that it will take a considerable amount of time to put together an overall plan.
There are fears that the longer the announcement is delayed, the shorter the preparation time until the opening will be, which will have an impact on surrounding development.
Even before the location of the new station is decided, there is uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a citizens&#39; group in Kyoto City, which is along the extension route, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the extension plan to be scrapped.
In Ishikawa prefecture politics, with the start of construction postponed, there have been calls for reconsideration of the Maibara route, and there are a series of moves to start over from scratch with the route settings that had already been settled, making it difficult to say that neighboring prefectures are united.
The people of Obama are reacting relatively calmly to the postponement of construction, but there are concerns that with the location of the new station unknown and the opening date unclear, this will have an adverse effect on future momentum.
Mayor Matsuzaki Koji plans to continue lobbying the national government for an early opening of the entire line, but the voices of the local communities along the line calling for construction to begin as soon as possible will be essential.
Indifference, such as &quot;The Shinkansen will run (west of Tsuruga) someday&quot; will not move the national government or local governments in neighboring prefectures.
I want the enthusiasm to continue speaking out.
The Valentine&#39;s Day chocolate section, where tastings have been revived for the first time in three years, was held on February 9th at Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture.
With Valentine&#39;s Day on February 14th approaching, retail prices of chocolate are rising due to soaring costs of raw materials and packaging materials, but sales of higher-priced chocolates as &quot;treat chocolates&quot; for oneself, or for family and friends are booming.
Retail stores and confectionery shops in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that highlight local flavor, luxury, and attention to ingredients.
Seibu Fukui store (Fukui city) opened a special sales area on the 6th floor event space on January 25th.
Until the 14th, 450 varieties from approximately 40 brands, including 10 confectionery shops within the prefecture, will be on sale.
Chocolate made with local Fukui sake and sandwich-style products with ganache sandwiched between cookies are said to be popular.
According to a store representative, the retail prices of many items have increased by about 10% compared to the previous year.
Regarding this year&#39;s trends, &quot;there are many products that stand out with their distinctive features, such as using high-quality ingredients or having luxurious packaging.Consumers are increasingly purchasing products for themselves or their family and enjoying comparing the taste of different products.&quot;
Despite the headwind of price increases, sales of higher price range products are said to be strong.
⇒Due to rising prices, the average price per pill has increased by 25 yen
&quot;We aim to create a sales area where customers can enjoy the Valentine&#39;s Day event itself,&quot; said the person in charge.
The store has been selling different recommended sweets of the day since January 26th, and has also resumed tastings for the first time in three years.
Western confectionery club (head office: Ippon Tanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City), a manufacturer and retailer of Western confectionery, launched its original chocolate series &quot;KISEKI,&quot; which was jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate manufacturer at the end of last year, for the first time in the Valentine&#39;s Day sales season.
Made with carefully selected cocoa beans, the chocolates have a fruity taste with reduced bitterness, and are sold for 1,000 yen for a pack of three or 3,000 yen for a pack of nine.
Ryuma Takakura, the company&#39;s director and purchasing manager, said, &quot;While the culture of giving obligatory chocolate is gradually fading, there is still demand for people to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine&#39;s Day. We will differentiate our products by increasing the added value of our products.&quot;

On the 9th, a female office worker in her 20s (Fukui City) who visited the Seibu Fukui store was browsing the stores and said, &quot;I&#39;ve always loved chocolate, and now that I&#39;ve got a job and I&#39;m earning money, I want to buy some as a reward for myself.&quot;
A female office worker in her 30s (same prefecture), who purchased obligatory chocolate, said, &quot;It&#39;s a shame that the price hike will extend to chocolate as well, but since it&#39;s only once a year, I want to give them to my family and people who have looked after me on a regular basis. However, I may give them to fewer people.&quot;
Products using Fukui plums and midi tomatoes from the prefecture (February 9, Fukui Prefectural Office)
On February 9th, Seven-Eleven Japan announced that it would begin selling six new products, including new products using ingredients from Fukui Prefecture such as sweet shrimp, at 339 stores in the three Hokuriku prefectures from that day.
As part of the first anniversary commemoration of the signing of a comprehensive partnership agreement regarding prefectural government in general, the event will promote the appeal of local products.
In addition to four new products - shrimp miso ramen and fish ball soup made with sweet shrimp caught in the prefecture, a salad made with locally grown midi tomatoes, and cream puffs filled with habutae mochi and bean paste - the store will also be selling Fukui plum rice balls and sauce cutlet bowls.
It will be on sale until the 20th.

The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, believed to have been built in preparation for a battle with Heisenji Temple, Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inuikawa area of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, where the large Ushigahara Manor was once located.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built on the middle slope of Mount Nabedoko in the area in preparation for a battle with Heisenji Temple, which was in conflict with the manor during the Kamakura period.
He appears in the military tale &quot;Taiheiki.&quot;
No documents remain regarding Ushigahara Castle, but the following is written in Volume 11 of the Taiheiki, &quot;The Suicide of the Echizen Ushigahara Jito.&quot;
Aikawa Ukyonosuke Tokiharu, an official of the Kamakura Shogunate, was dispatched to Ono as the local lord.
In 1333, the Rokuhara Tandai, which had been established in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and control the western provinces, was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji, and the Kamakura shogunate was then destroyed by Nitta Yoshisada.
When Tokiharu&#39;s retainers heard the news that Rokuhara Tandai had been destroyed, they immediately fled, leaving only about 20 of them.
Taking advantage of this opportunity, the warrior monks of Heisenji Temple attacked.
Tokiharu forced his wife and two children to drown in the river, then followed them and committed suicide.

The castle ruins can be reached via a hiking trail maintained by the Dryside Improvement Association.
It is about 200 metres from the trailhead.
In winter, the road leading to the trailhead can be impassable by car due to accumulated snow.

Approximately 220 households in the Inuikawa district of Ono City have joined.
In the past, they published a guidebook to the dry side, introducing the ancient tombs, historical sites, and sights in the area.
The roadside station &quot;Rennyo-no-Sato Awara,&quot; currently under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22nd.
With an eye on the opening of Asuwa Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen line in spring 2024, the station is expected to attract approximately 360,000 users per year, and serve as a new regional development and tourist hub for the northern part of the city.
The station&#39;s main food and beverage and retail facility is a single-story steel-framed building with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The entire area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and Nagisa Children&#39;s Park, is 8,137 square meters.
The facility will also have a rest area and a tourist information center.
Electric bicycles can be rented and there are shower rooms available.
The two parking lots can accommodate a total of 66 small and large vehicles (including three for disabled people).
This was revealed by the city&#39;s mayor, Morinotsugu, at a regular press conference held on February 8th.
The food and drink corner sells parfaits made with fruits from the northern Sakai hills and Tomitsu Kintoki pie.
They are working on developing menus that make generous use of local ingredients, such as eggs on rice with Fukujidori chicken and autumn/winter-only dishes that use eel from Kitagata.
Currently, approximately 60 businesses are members of the direct sales store&#39;s &quot;Shippers Council.&quot;
The store will also expand its product lineup to include processed foods such as bento boxes and prepared meals, as well as agricultural and horticultural products such as seedlings and plants.
The souvenir section displays and sells works by artists resident at the Kanazu Sosaku no Mori Museum, as well as sweets, alcohol, traditional crafts, and more.

A cat-shaped food serving robot that has been introduced at &quot;Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch.&quot;
The adorable expressions of the dolls are popular with families. (Otemachi 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture)
The food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, is seeing a growing trend to introduce food serving robots that deliver food to customers&#39; tables.
In addition to being useful for reducing the number of staff required for store operations and providing &quot;contactless&quot; customer service to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the robot&#39;s adorable facial expressions are said to be popular with families.
Restaurant owners and other related parties have said, &quot;It&#39;s difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, so food delivery robots will likely become even more common.&quot;
&quot;Gin, gin, Genghis Khan♪&quot;.
A robot with a cat&#39;s face displayed on the screen smoothly moves around the store carrying food while playing light music.
When they arrive at a customer&#39;s table, they will greet the customer by saying something like, &quot;We&#39;ve brought you the food you ordered.&quot;
Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch, a Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan restaurant in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped food delivery robot in August 2022.
Customers place their ordered food on a robot waiting near the kitchen and press the table number on the screen, and the robot will then drive autonomously to the table and deliver it.
It is equipped with AI (artificial intelligence) and voice functions, and reacts when customers touch it, and the cat face displayed on the screen has a variety of expressions.
The Bonta Group, which operates this restaurant, has introduced food serving robots at two of its stores, including this one.
President Saito Toshiyuki said the main reason for the introduction was &quot;labor shortage,&quot; and emphasized that it is part of efforts to improve productivity through labor-saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but the introduction of this system has reduced this to 21-22%.
The robot also has the role of collecting plates after customers have finished eating, which makes cleanup more efficient. He adds that &quot;it delights families and children and also has a promotional effect.&quot;
Rokukan Seizan Fukui, a yakiniku and horumon hotpot restaurant located in Araki Shinbo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a food serving robot in August 2022.
Nagafuku Hoshiyama, president of Songsan Shoten, which operates the company, explains the reason for introducing the system, saying, &quot;Even when we advertise for full-time employees and part-time workers, it&#39;s difficult to get them to apply. We thought it was absolutely necessary to resolve the labor shortage.&quot;
At the Fukui store, the zone where employees deliver food is separated from the robot&#39;s delivery area.
The cost of leasing a robot is said to be about the same as the wages of a part-time worker.
In order to reduce the number of staff required, the store is using robots as well as a tablet ordering system and is also considering installing self-checkouts.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the effective job offer ratio by occupation in December 2010 was 6.94 for &quot;customer service&quot; jobs such as those in restaurants, making it an occupation with a high labor shortage.
A representative from Net System (Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which acts as a sales agent for the food delivery robot, said, &quot;Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the labor shortage at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, so we are receiving many inquiries about introducing robots.&quot;
President Hoshiyama analyzed, &quot;It will become even more difficult for suburban stores in regional areas to secure employees in the future, so I think food delivery robots will become more widespread.&quot;
[Editorial] Echizen Town is creating end-of-life notes and distributing them to residents who request them.
The idea for this project came from the fact that two years ago they published a &quot;Condolence Handbook&quot; that covered the procedures that need to be followed when a family member passes away, as well as a fill-in list of inheritances and a family tree, and many people came to collect one for themselves.
Classes on how to write end-of-life notes and how to organize one&#39;s life while still alive are frequently held throughout the prefecture, and it appears that the idea of &quot;end-of-life planning&quot; has become firmly established among the prefecture&#39;s residents.
Echizen Town&#39;s ending note is 35 pages long.
The book is divided into five chapters and begins with a look back at one&#39;s life history, and then goes on to write about one&#39;s current health and financial situation, future care needs, wishes regarding end-of-life medical care, and requests regarding funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can write about things you want to do in the rest of your life and messages to loved ones.
Thirty-five pages seems like a lot to write, but you don&#39;t need to fill every page.
What do you most want to leave behind for your family and those around you?
The key is to have clarity of purpose.
A wide variety of notebooks for different purposes are available at bookstores, so you can simply start writing in whatever you can.
The term &quot;shukatsu&quot; was coined in 2009, in analogy with job hunting.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
Many people have come to realize the reality that &quot;death comes suddenly,&quot; and it is said that more people are preparing for their own final moments and terminal illnesses.
It&#39;s been more than 10 years since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world is still not over.
Prices have risen due to factors such as Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, and electricity bills have skyrocketed to unimaginable prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to keep up with the current rise in prices, leaving many people worried about the future.
On the other hand, while funeral expenses, nursing care costs, and grave maintenance were once shared among siblings and relatives, it is no longer uncommon for parents to be an only child.
Furthermore, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a generation ago, the risk of developing dementia or needing nursing care increases as people get older, creating a dilemma.
It is important to keep in mind that one of the reasons why end-of-life planning has not been a passing fad but has become established is that this growing social anxiety is one of the reasons.
In any case, everyone wants to avoid putting undue strain on their partners and children.
&quot;Spending your final moments being yourself&quot; seems to be a popular keyword in end-of-life notes, but it&#39;s important not to be too self-centered.
Rather than secretly writing down your hopes and requests, it is best to first discuss them with your family and others and calmly prepare for that time.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from the right) and Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Keiko Nagaoka (third from the right) pose for a commemorative photograph with relevant parties at an elementary school they visited.
He expressed the view that, in principle, it is not necessary for students and teachers to wear masks at graduation ceremonies (February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture)
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided on a policy regarding the wearing of masks by students at graduation ceremonies, stating that &quot;it is basic not to wear masks.&quot;
The principal of a large junior high school explained, &quot;It&#39;s actually difficult to maintain a wide distance between students, so we&#39;re struggling with how to respond. Some students feel uneasy about taking off their masks.&quot;
Following reports about wearing masks at graduation ceremonies, the topic has come up among teachers as well.
Meanwhile, the principal of one elementary school predicted, &quot;If the government makes a decision, we probably won&#39;t have to wear masks. But as long as it&#39;s not used for choir singing, I think it could be a realistic solution.&quot;
Some schools in the prefecture are exploring ways to relax measures, such as allowing current students who had refrained from attending the graduation ceremony and resuming graduate choral performances.
In the prefecture, public high schools are scheduled to hold their ceremonies in early March, while public elementary and junior high schools are scheduled to hold theirs in mid-March.
Prefectural and city boards of education plan to wait for official notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology before deciding how to respond.
There were also cautious voices raised about the Ministry of Education&#39;s decision to not require students to wear masks in all school educational activities starting from the new school term this spring.
The elementary school principal said, &quot;Children will be confused if they are suddenly not allowed to wear masks one day. We first decide that &#39;wearing is optional,&#39; and then it will be natural for more and more children to gradually take them off.&quot;
× × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided that in line with new government guidelines on mask wearing, from April, wearing masks will no longer be required during school educational activities.
As a general rule, masks are not permitted during choir, physical education classes, or club activities.
During the 2022 fiscal year, infection control measures will be required in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and precautions to take from April onwards will be made known to boards of education and schools.

Every year during the exam season, Hair Atelier Rimurimu, a beauty salon in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, cuts the hair of students using scissors that have been blessed with prayers for success.
Test takers have given positive feedback, saying things like &quot;I feel more confident&quot; and &quot;I was able to take the exam calmly.&quot;
Yasushi Nagata, the salon&#39;s president, has seen and heard of students opening their textbooks while waiting for their haircut, and students venting their anxiety about exams while getting their hair cut.
So in 2014, he started offering prayer cuts for success in exams, hoping that it would help even a little.
⇒ Final day of application for national and public universities
Every year, on the first day of work at the beauty salon, employees have their scissors and combs prayed for success at Kazusa Shrine in Wakatakecho, the city.
Around 80 people get their hair cut each year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are also a variety of other exams such as employment exams and driver&#39;s license exams.
He presents them with a pencil, which is said to be a good luck charm for success.
⇒ Ogi Mama &quot;To you who are taking the high school entrance exam&quot;
One man (19) who made the cut in 2021 and was successfully accepted into the University of Tokyo said, &quot;I was happy to feel the support I received. I used the gold pencil I was given during the exam and it really gave me motivation.&quot;
A book self-published by the NPO &quot;Heartwarming Anthology Editorial Office&quot; titled &quot;Dear Prime Minister: From Tojinbo, &#39;The Breakwater of Life&#39;&quot;
I have self-published my 10th book with the title &quot;Dear Prime Minister, From Tojinbo, the Breakwater of Life.&quot;
The story has been featured in newspapers across the country, and many readers have sent in comments.
The purpose of publishing this book is to share with you the information I gained from interviews with people who have attempted suicide about the &quot;social and structural&quot; environmental issues that are the causes of suicide in Japan, with the hope of helping to create a &quot;society where it is comfortable to live.&quot;
For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the water&#39;s edge of Tojinbo in Fukui Prefecture, a famous suicide spot, to prevent suicides, and continue to provide support to those who attempt suicide, protecting them and helping them to make a fresh start.
This book summarizes the issues heard from the 784 people (as of February 6th) who have been taken into care so far, and makes the following seven appeals to the Prime Minister regarding necessary national policies to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are “life-saving” activities.
(2) Behind every suicide there are a number of &quot;human rights violations.&quot;
(3) Suicide victims are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens who live outside their jurisdiction as &quot;outsiders&quot; and treat them poorly.
(5) People with mental disorders such as depression are drugged, and even if they commit suicide, it is treated as an &quot;accident.&quot;
(6) The &quot;duty of care&quot; in high-risk suicide areas has been forgotten and commercialism has taken hold.
(7) Any part of the doctrines of new religious groups that cannot be scientifically proven is a deception, and threatening others with future curses in order to extract money or valuables is extortion.
Religious groups that commit the criminal acts of &quot;fraud and extortion&quot; should be made public and eliminated.
We have received many impressive comments from readers of this book, such as, &quot;I was moved by the strong mentality of the people involved in this activity,&quot; &quot;This former police officer is a model for all police officers,&quot; and &quot;He is a living bodhisattva, supporting someone who is such a stranger to us as if he were his own family.&quot; We would like to introduce some of these comments here.
When I saw the photo in the newspaper article, tears welled up in my eyes and I thought, &quot;What were you thinking...&quot;
I&#39;ve heard that there has been an increase in suicides among people who have been driven to the brink by the coronavirus pandemic.
It&#39;s really sad.
Everyone can be themselves.
I want to live in a society where people can be happy with the life they have been given.
I felt respect and gratitude for the staff who were doing their best to care for those suffering so much that they wanted to die.
I believe this activity is physically and mentally demanding, but please take care of yourself and continue to reach out to us.
thank you.
Smart
We hope that all of our readers will also become gatekeepers of life in their communities.

Kenji Shimada, who photographs capybaras almost every week and posts the photos on social media, was photographed at the indoor amusement park &quot;Hapijan&quot; in Asuwayama Park, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, on February 1st.
A man in Fukui Prefecture takes photos of capybaras at Hapijan, an indoor amusement park in Asuwayama Park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, every week and posts them on Instagram.
The post features a variety of thumbnail images, including one of her yawning with her big mouth showing her teeth, and another of her lying down and basking in the sun.
With over 10,000 followers both in Japan and overseas, he is helping to spread awareness of the charms of Hapijan and capybaras to many people.
⇒Shizuka Kudo posts pictures of traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The man is Kenji Shimada (38), an office worker who lives in the city.
We started posting on social networking sites (SNS) in March 2021.
Capybaras are one of the world&#39;s largest rodents, and have webbed feet that make them good swimmers.
Since opening in 2018, Hapijan has been raising three animals - one male and two females - and visitors can observe them up close and feed them.
Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
After seeing a video of a rabbit relaxing in a hot spring, he was shocked and asked, &quot;What kind of animal is this?&quot;
I was drawn to their charming expressions and gestures, almost like those of a human.
I heard that it would then be kept at Hapijan, and I was looking forward to being able to see it up close.
I started taking photographs seriously about three years ago when I bought a single-lens reflex camera.
It is used to capture the adorable behavior of capybaras, and never misses a photo opportunity, such as when they shake their bodies and cut through the water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has reached about 830, and when he looks back, he says, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I took so many photos.&quot;
The male Yamato must have remembered Shimada from his frequent visits, as he would approach her and make a &quot;kyuru kyuru&quot; sound.
&quot;They&#39;re so cute, and it makes me happy,&quot; says Shimada, whose love for capybaras continues to grow.
He also enjoys interacting with capybara lovers from all over the country via social media, sharing his best shots every month.
Shimada, who also visits zoos in nearby prefectures to see capybaras, smiled and said, &quot;I would like to continue taking photos and sharing them, mainly at my home mountain, Asuwayama.&quot;

Toba City demands return of double payment of child-rearing household subsidy - Ise Shimbun
[Toba] On the 10th, Toba City announced that a total of 600,000 yen had been mistakenly paid out to 12 people in 11 households for the fiscal year 2021 Special Living Support Grant for Child-Rearing Households (and other households).
The city will apologize to the people affected and explain the situation, and will ask them to go through the process of returning the items.
According to the city, the problem was discovered when a parent of a child who had checked past payments on January 27, 2023, pointed it out.
When they checked all 182 people (79 households) who were eligible for the benefit in that fiscal year, they found that 12 people (11 households) had received the benefit twice on July 20, 2021.
The city will provide a grant of 50,000 yen per child, including high school students and younger, to households that are exempt from resident tax.
The data provided by the contracted computer company included eligible children, but the staff member in charge mistakenly believed that this did not include high school students and added them to the data, resulting in double payments.
A representative from the city&#39;s child-rearing support office said, &quot;We take this matter very seriously and will strive to restore trust by taking all necessary measures to prevent a recurrence, including re-checking the data.&quot;

It&#39;s snowing again.
It appears that this is not a cold wave from the north, but rather the result of a low pressure system moving east along the south coast of the Japanese archipelago.
It has only been a short time since the unusually cold weather that occurred from the 24th to the 26th of last month, so we still need to be on our guard. The same cold will be even more unbearable for the people of the Republic of Turkey, which was hit by a major earthquake.
The building collapsed in an instant.
So far, more than 20,000 people have been killed, including those in neighboring Syria, and many are still left stranded in the rubble.The country is known as a pro-Japanese country.
It all began in 1890 with the sinking of the Ertugrul, a warship sent to Japan by the Ottoman Empire at the time.
The fact that residents of Kushimoto Town, Wakayama Prefecture, near the incident area, rescued and cared for the crew, has been featured in films and novels. Approximately 100 years after the accident, a Turkish Airlines plane was dispatched to rescue Japanese hostages taken by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War, repaying the debt.
Anyone who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this pain.
I want to keep an eye on this until the situation calms down and reconstruction and recovery begin.

Bellino Hotel fraudulently received subsidies from prefecture and city accommodation support program; full amount already returned | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichi Nichi Shimbun
On the 10th, the prefecture and Ichinoseki city announced that Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame, Ichinoseki city) had been inappropriately using their respective subsidy programs to provide discounts on accommodation fees for travelers for approximately one year since October 2021.
When people who were not eligible for the discount stayed at the hotel, employees lent their names to receive the discount.
It was also confirmed that many employees were using the facilities for accommodation, which is not in line with the business&#39;s purpose of &quot;stimulating tourism demand.&quot;
The full amount of the subsidy, 7,231,000 yen, which was found to have been used inappropriately, including through an independent investigation by the prefecture, city, and hotel, had been returned by the 6th of this month.
The cases of fraudulent receipt of subsidies occurred in the prefecture&#39;s accommodation discount &quot;Iwate Travel Support Project,&quot; which was implemented in response to the spread of COVID-19, and the city&#39;s emergency measures program for tourist accommodation facilities, the &quot;Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount.&quot;
The period was from Oct. 18, 2021 to Oct. 10, 2022 (the Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount is until Sept. 30, 2022), and the investigation found 95 cases of inappropriate use, totaling 587,000 yen, that were ineligible for the discount due to reasons such as being outside the target area or not having been vaccinated, and 1,239 cases of use that were not in line with the purpose and objectives of the project, totaling 6,644,000 yen.
As the prefecture&#39;s business contractor was going through the settlement procedures, it discovered several cases where the user of the accommodation discount was the same person as the hotel&#39;s receptionist.
A detailed investigation by the prefecture revealed the inappropriate use, and the city, which received the information, also confirmed the facts.
The city&#39;s project has already ended, and the registration as a prefectural project was removed on December 2nd of last year.
In an interview, Michiaki Dobashi, CEO of Bellino, which operates the hotel, said, &quot;We are sorry for causing trouble to the local community, the prefecture, the city, and many other people. We are very remorseful. The hotel exists because of the local community, so we would like to start again from scratch and work to regain trust.&quot; He added that he plans to hold another compliance training session for all employees.
Chiba Takahito, head of the promotion division of the prefecture&#39;s tourism and promotion office, said, &quot;This is truly regrettable. We would like to once again urge people to follow the rules and establish compliance, and call for appropriate use in line with the purpose of the project.&quot;
Mayor Yoshihito Sato issued a statement saying, &quot;It is truly regrettable that there has been inappropriate use of the business at a lodging facility in the city.&quot;
Horses and riders breathe brightly as training begins. Ritual held at Mizusawa and Morioka Racecourses | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichi Nichi Shimbun
The prefectural racing association&#39;s training start ceremony was held on the 10th at Mizusawa and Morioka racecourses, with those involved praying for the safety of both horses and riders and purifying the racecourse.
At Mizusawa Racecourse in Mizusawa-aneta-cho, Oshu City, a religious ceremony was held in front of the Barekijin deity, with about 50 people in attendance, including staff from the racecourse, horse owners, jockeys and stable hands, and course director Kenichi Odashima and others offering sacred offerings.
At the main arena, the priest and a representative went around the corners and purified them by sprinkling cut hemp.
During training, several racehorses were taken out onto the track for some light training.
Horses were also seen breathing out white breath in the cold.
The racecourse will install new track lighting in preparation for the 2023 season.
It will now be possible to hold the event at twilight, and full operation will begin after test lighting has been carried out.

Ramen shop offering new menu items on Thursdays only: Dandan noodles Roadside Station Kinshuko [Nishiwaga] | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichi Nichi Shimbun
Kinshuko Roadside Station (Manager: Masuoka Yukiki) in Suginabata, Nishiwaga Town will open its ramen restaurant, Menya Nishiki, on Thursdays only, a day when it had previously been closed as a restaurant.
They have developed a new dish, dandan noodles (850 yen including tax), using locally produced ingredients, allowing more people to enjoy the local flavors.
Kinshuko, a restaurant at the roadside station that serves dishes such as &quot;Yuda Dam Curry&quot; (1,200 yen) and &quot;Nishiwaga Whole Ramen&quot; (900 yen), was closed on Thursdays to ensure that staff had the day off, but customers there reportedly expressed disappointment.
In response to this, on the 9th they started serving only ramen, which can accommodate small groups.
The restaurant decided to limit its menu to four items - soy sauce ramen, soy sauce pork ramen, miso ramen, and miso pork ramen - as well as dandan noodles.
The new dandan noodles, released to coincide with the opening of Menya Nishiki, are based on Yukikko miso, which is made from soybeans and sun-dried salt produced in Nishiwaga, and also feature locally grown green onions, western bracken, minced meat, and chili peppers.
There have been many orders from the first day, and the company is considering offering the service on days other than Thursdays in the future.
The road station will be closed from May 2021 to November 2022 due to the closure of National Route 107.
During this time, the company operated a replacement store, Nishiki Ramen and Rice Bowl Shop, in Kotsunazawa, the same town, and will utilize the know-how it has accumulated.
Manager Masuoka promotes the store by saying, &quot;Dandan noodles, which warm the body, are perfect for this time of year. We don&#39;t have a large menu, but we hope you&#39;ll enjoy eating something delicious and feel happy.&quot;
Winter opening hours are the same as the restaurant, from 11:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. (last orders at 2:00 p.m.).
For inquiries, please contact the station on the same road: 0197 (84) 2990.
Introducing the pioneers of plant research, including materials collected on Mt. Hayachine, City Cultural Properties Center special exhibition [Hanamaki] | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichi Nichi Shimbun
A special exhibition titled &quot;The People Who Introduced the Flowers of Hayachine - A Brief History of Hayachine Plant Research,&quot; which focuses on the pioneers who built the foundations for botanical research on Mount Hayachine, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is being held at the City General Cultural Properties Center in Osakocho, Hanamaki City until the 12th.
The museum has collected 124 documents, including valuable specimens collected by our predecessors, and showcases the footsteps of our predecessors who were involved in botanical research on Mount Hayachine.
Research into plants on Mount Hayachine began with the Russian botanical researcher Karl Johan Maximovich (1827-1891), who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Chonosuke Sugawara (1842-1925), a native of Shiwa Town, who collected plants under Maximovich&#39;s guidance.
As a foreigner, Maksimovic was not allowed to roam freely around the country, so he asked Sugawa to collect specimens, and he continued his research for three years, based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support Maksimovic&#39;s research after he returned to Japan, which led to the discovery of the Himekozakura, Nanbutouchisou, and Miyamayamabukishouma, species endemic to Mt. Hayachine.
Later, in 1903 (Meiji 36), the modern plant taxonomist Makino Tomitaro (1862-1957) announced the names of plants such as &quot;Nanbu toranoo,&quot; &quot;Kobanotomekusa,&quot; and &quot;Nanbu dogpurse&quot; based on specimens collected by local researchers, and in 1905 (Meiji 38), he himself climbed Mount Hayachine and discovered and named &quot;Kato chickweed.&quot;
The exhibits show how precious alpine plants have been uncovered by many researchers.
The exhibition also introduces Sugimura Matsunosuke (1874-1948), the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School and botanical researcher who accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 1927 (Showa 2), and Tamagawa Shichiro (1914-1988), who served as curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum and was involved in the publication of &quot;Plants of Hayachine.&quot;
Yoshida Sohei, a curator and researcher at the center, said, &quot;Behind the names of each of Mt. Hayachine&#39;s plants lies the accumulation of a lot of research and connections between people.We can trace the connections between researchers that extend from the local area to the whole country.&quot;
The special exhibition is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 examines the faith and history of Hayachine, while Chapter 2 focuses on the geological characteristics of Mount Hayachine based on research by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundations of Japanese geology.
JR: Suspension of service of conventional lines in Iwate Prefecture | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichi Nichi Shimbun
Due to the heavy snowfall, JR conventional lines in the prefecture were suspended on the 10th, including Kitakami, Hanawa, Yamada, Ofunato, Kamaishi, and Hachinohe lines.
According to the JR Morioka Branch, three trains on the Kitakami Line were suspended between Kitakami and Yokote, causing travel disruption for about 80 passengers, and four trains on the Ofunato Line were suspended between Ichinoseki and Kesennuma, affecting about 280 passengers.
The branch office announced its conventional train operation plans for the 11th, as heavy snow is expected.

On the Ofunato Line, services will be suspended on both inbound and outbound lines between Ichinoseki and Kesennuma from the first train departure until around 5:30 p.m., while on the Kamaishi Line, services will be suspended on the outbound line between Morioka and Kamaishi from the first train departure until around noon, and on the inbound line from the first train departure until around 11 a.m.
Some trains on the Tohoku Line will also be suspended on both lines.
Plans are subject to change depending on weather conditions.
Even though the ball changed direction, his famous fastball shone through.
Lotte&#39;s Roki Sasaki (Ofunato High School) made his first appearance on the mound in batting practice at the team&#39;s Ishigaki camp in Okinawa on the 9th, throwing 30 pitches using balls used in the World Baseball Classic (WBC) and reaching a speed of 160 km/h.
He faced six batters and only managed two hits, and expressed a sense of satisfaction, saying, &quot;I gained a lot from this.My forkball is a little better than it was in last year&#39;s training match.&quot;
The pitch was measured at 160 km/h twice, jamming Fujiwara and resulting in a foul, while Yasuda grounded out to second base.
The pitcher calmly took the lead by mixing in sliders and planning his pitches, and Matsukawa, who received the ball, was impressed with the quality of the pitches, saying, &quot;Those were really strong balls and the batters were caught out.&quot;
Manager Yoshii also seemed satisfied with the player&#39;s steady progress in his fourth year as a professional, saying, &quot;I think things are going well. Things are going well at the moment.&quot;
As the next step, the highly-anticipated strong arm will take to the mound in a practice game against Yakult on the 15th (Itoman, Okinawa), where he is scheduled to throw around 40 pitches.
&quot;I want to improve the accuracy of my fastballs and the overall cohesion,&quot; he says, focusing on the details.
Idlib province in northwestern Syria, hit by a major earthquake - early morning on the 9th (provided by local residents, Kyodo News)
[Gaziantep, southern Turkey]: The confirmed death toll from the massive earthquake that originated in southern Turkey exceeded 21,000 in both countries as of the 9th, according to authorities in affected countries Turkey and neighboring Syria.
In the bitterly cold, rescuing survivors from collapsed buildings and other structures is becoming more difficult as time passes.
A frantic search was carried out in the affected areas.
On the 9th, the United Nations delivered supplies to the devastated Idlib province in northwestern Syria across the Turkish border for the first time since the earthquake on the 6th.
Idlib province is the last stronghold of rebels fighting the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war, and there were concerns that international aid might not reach it.
Rescue operations are continuing at the disaster sites in both countries using heavy machinery, but are proving difficult.
Many people are believed to remain buried under rubble, so the death toll is likely to rise further.
Turkish authorities have confirmed 17,674 deaths in Türkiye.
Including the more than 3,000 deaths in Syria, the disaster is worse than the devastating 1999 earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which killed more than 17,000 people.
Miyako City plans to implement its own support measures to subsidize energy expenses such as electricity, gas, and gasoline for businesses in the city that are struggling to secure profits due to rising fuel and commodity prices.
As an emergency measure, we will use our own financial resources to support the local economy, which is currently in a difficult environment.
This applies to businesses in all industries (excluding agriculture, forestry, fishing, electricity and gas supply companies, etc.).
Requirements include that the profit margin for the most recently completed fiscal year must be lower than the previous year.
The subsidy amount will be half of the increase in expenses for a consecutive six-month period between April 2022 and March 2023 compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, with a maximum of 1 million yen per business.
It is expected that approximately 800 people will receive the payment.

[Gaziantep, southern Turkey, Kyodo News] The confirmed number of casualties in the massive earthquake that struck southern Turkey on the 6th exceeded 23,000 in both countries as of the 10th, according to authorities in affected countries Turkey and neighboring Syria.
This exceeds the approximately 22,000 dead and missing (including related deaths) that were recorded in the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.
As the cold winter weather continues in the affected areas, desperate searches are underway at the sites of collapsed buildings for missing people, and there are fears that the death toll will rise further.
According to Turkish Health Minister Koca, Turkey&#39;s death toll has surpassed 20,000, reaching 20,213.
The number of injured reached more than 80,000.
According to the Syrian Health Ministry, 1,387 people have been confirmed dead in the country&#39;s civil war-torn country.
At the city council general meeting on the 10th, Miyako City reported that it had completed the acquisition of the real estate for the former commercial facility &quot;Quatre Miyako.&quot;
In order to redevelop the site, the company plans to conduct basic surveys in fiscal 2023 and present the basic direction of its development plan.
The property acquired included the Quatre building, its land of approximately 29.6 ares, a multi-story parking lot, etc., at a cost of 94 million yen.
Procedures such as ownership transfer registration were completed by mid-December last year.
The basic survey, scheduled to be conducted in fiscal 2011, will grasp the current situation and issues regarding land use in the central city area, facility location, population density, etc., and analyze future predictions.
We will consider the future vision, including what facilities will be needed.
It will also be included in the city&#39;s location optimization plan, which is necessary when utilizing national subsidies.

Amami Airport&#39;s 2nd Decarbonization Promotion Council Discusses Renewable Energy Introduction and Goals | Society and Economy | Nankai Nichi Nichi Shimbun
The promotion council discussed the decarbonization of Amami Airport on the 9th in Kasaricho, Amami City.
The Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council (chairman: Ando Takashi, head of the Construction Division of the Amami Oshima Branch Office, 13 members), which is composed of the prefecture and airlines that use the airport, held its second meeting at Amami Airport (Kasari-cho, Amami City) on the 9th, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the airport.
All committee members attended, including online.
They exchanged opinions on setting decarbonization goals and introducing renewable energy, primarily solar power generation.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall goal of reducing each airport&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions by more than 46% by 2030 (compared to fiscal 2013 levels) with the aim of achieving &quot;carbon neutrality&quot; by 2050, which would mean zero greenhouse gas emissions.
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year, and aims to develop a plan ahead of the other six remote island airports in the prefecture.
Like the first, the second meeting will be closed to the public except for the opening remarks.
According to Chairman Ando, who responded to an interview after the meeting, the meeting reviewed the airport&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions.
The two companies reportedly held discussions in line with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism&#39;s guidelines to set targets and introduce renewable energy.
According to the distributed materials, the baseline CO2 emissions from the airport&#39;s facilities and vehicles in fiscal 2013 was 1,476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of this, emissions from lighting and air conditioning at seven facilities, including the airport terminal building, accounted for approximately 90% at 1,321 tons, followed by aviation lighting at 84 tons and airport vehicles at 71 tons.
The council will continue discussions on reducing emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando said, &quot;We are just at a passing point. The committee members are aligned in their direction, and we would like to first thoroughly put together a draft interim report.&quot;
Going forward, a promotion plan will be formulated after hearing opinions on the draft interim report at the third meeting and on the draft final report at the fourth meeting.
&quot;Sakasama Real Estate&quot; opens Okinoerabu branch to attract people to the island People who want to rent a house are looking for landlords | Society and Economy | Nankai Nichi Nichi Shimbun
Opening event to deepen understanding of &quot;Sakasama Real Estate&quot; through talk sessions etc. (8th, Chimei Town)
[Okinoerabu Regional Office] The opening event for the Okinoerabu branch of Sakasama Real Estate, a real estate web service that visualizes the desires of people who want to try something new by renting vacant houses or vacant stores and recruits landlords, was held on the 8th at the community space &quot;entaku&quot; in China, China Town.
The operating company explained the details of the service during a talk session.
Masahiro Okubo, executive director of Tsuginova (Rishiri District, Hokkaido), which is responsible for running the branch office, said, &quot;By carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabujima, we hope to create a movement and trend that will attract people to the entire island.&quot;
Sakasama Real Estate operates in a way that is the opposite of normal real estate procedures: the person wanting to rent discloses their information, the landlord contacts them, and once an agreement is reached, each party enters into a contract.
The service, operated by On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture), began in June 2020 as a demonstration experiment to uncover potential vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses.
This is the seventh branch office to be opened, and the first in Kyushu.
This is the first time this has been done on a remote island in the country.
Approximately 20 people participated in the event, including staff from On-Co and Tsuginova, town hall officials from Wadomari and Chinen, and local residents.
Executive Director Okubo explained the background to the opening of the branch office, saying, &quot;As efforts to attract people from outside the island are gaining momentum, we thought that if we could utilize vacant houses and stores, it could help liven up the town and the island.&quot;
&quot;We want to connect with people who own property on the island and those who want to do something, and help as many people as possible move their efforts forward,&quot; he said.
On-Co representative Mizutani Takefumi pointed out the important points to take note of when running the properties, saying, &quot;It is necessary to take care of each and every vacant house and have discussions with local people about what they want to do with the area, what type of people they want to attract, and what criteria to use when selecting properties.&quot;
&quot;The deeper the connections between people, the more information will be gathered,&quot; he said, calling on islanders to participate in the discussions and help provide information.
SoftBank&#39;s new foreign player in development, Luis Rodriguez, will he wear the uniform number 156, the same number worn by Tagami Sota?

I painted all of my Gunpla.
How many points?
For now, I&#39;ve properly created and finished the armament, so I&#39;d give it about 50 points.

I haven&#39;t used it yet.
I don&#39;t think the products listed will become cheaper yet.
Are there any campaigns offering discounts for using cards?
If I turn the key on and operate the blinker on the NSR250R without starting the engine, will the blinker flash?
If the battery is normal, when you turn the key to the ON position, power will be applied to the ACC (accessories), so the turn signals, brake lights, etc. will come on.
It also makes a horn.
However, the voltage increases after the engine is started, so it becomes more powerful.
Can ADATA DDR4 and Samsung DDR4 be mixed?
It&#39;s a laptop.
In principle, as long as the pin arrangement, voltage, frequency, and other specifications are the same, they can be used together.
If it were just a difference in frequency, the specifications would be such that it would operate in sync with the slower one, but there are cases where this does not work properly depending on the item, so it is not guaranteed to be safe.

Is this thinning hair?
This is a split in the hair caused by the hairstyle.
If you continue to have this hairstyle, be careful not to comb or brush your hair incorrectly, as this can lead to thinning hair.
As long as you comb your hair correctly, it won&#39;t cause hair loss.
If you don&#39;t like your scalp showing, changing your hairstyle to one that won&#39;t split will solve the problem.
Is this Dunhill wallet genuine?
If it was purchased at a famous department store such as Takashimaya, it would come with a warranty and you can be sure it is genuine, but isn&#39;t that the case?
A present or something?!
If you are suspicious, have it appraised by an expert at a nearby pawn shop or brand buying store.
Didn&#39;t inexperienced club advisor teachers not participate in club activities when they were students?
If a club advisor has no experience, it is because there is no one else with experience (including those who are already advisors for other clubs), and it does not necessarily mean that they were not involved in club activities during their student days.
I&#39;m a high school student.

Why is it said that a structure smaller than 1/20 of the wavelength can be approximated as a continuous medium?

It&#39;s a little pricey, but they also have some very simple chocolates, so I recommend it.
Do you live alone?
Are you having fun?
I was living alone.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Humans are creatures of habit, so if a series of enjoyable days continues, that state of affairs becomes part of everyday life.
Once fun becomes part of your daily routine, you will no longer feel like it&#39;s &quot;fun&quot; unless something even more fun comes along.
I understand this, so I enjoy ``ordinary everyday life.&#39;&#39;

If I paint stainless steel with a paint spray, will it become less likely to attract a magnet?
Yes, it depends on the magnetic force.
In fact, as No.1 wrote, stainless steel does not stick to a magnet, so it&#39;s probably low-purity stainless steel with iron mixed in.
This is a common story with fake stainless steel made in China.

I have a mid-model 2017, and I&#39;d like to upgrade it to the final model, late-model specification, but it seems that just replacing the lights won&#39;t do.
Has anyone converted an early/mid model to the late model?
How much did it cost?
Also, what other things did it help besides the light?
If anyone knows more about this, could you please let me know? Thank you.
It&#39;s generally cheaper to buy the later model.

Thank you for your answer.

How would you feel if the girl you like kept every box of chocolate you&#39;ve ever given her?

I think it&#39;s important to blend in with the atmosphere of the people around you.
First, observe the people in your company and then make a judgment.
I think it&#39;s best to strike a balance between people who dress flashy and people who dress modestly in the office.

What are you worried about?
Do living things have a tendency not to want to leave the place where they were born?
They don&#39;t want to leave the place they are used to living in because it is safe and they can catch food there.
If there is danger or food runs out, they will leave.
This is how humans spread from Africa to all over the world.

This is a platform (app) for automated trading (buying and selling by program) in FX.
MT is an abbreviation for MetaTrader.
4 and 5 are different versions.
Why am I such a loser?
That&#39;s probably because you&#39;re comparing yourself to someone who&#39;s incredibly talented.
Because we compare ourselves to others, we end up seeing ourselves as excellent, amazing, or no good.
Isn&#39;t it good to be yourself?
If you achieve your personal best, then at least you&#39;re not a &quot;bad guy.&quot;
Recently, ramen has been drenched in back fat and kimchi, making it really spicy and greasy!
Bad taste!
Do you have any light ramen, like soy sauce ramen or light pork bone ramen?
No need for Korean style!
Chinese noodles from an old restaurant in the town!
Any restaurant that serves rice bowls, udon, soba, etc. is OK.
I like that kind of ramen too.
Hida Takayama ramen and Kitakata ramen are light in flavor.
I&#39;m going to an interview for a part-time job at a supermarket tomorrow.
I’m worried about what I’ll be asked.
・Basic information to write on your resume (You may be asked for this verbally again)

・Transportation expenses
・Do you have part-time work experience?
Why did you choose this job?
・Days and times available for shifts
I think this is the bare minimum you should ask!

It is a civil law, not a constitutional law.
Have you ever had the flu in your lifetime?
Did it take a lot of times?
Personally, I&#39;ve forgotten what happened a long time ago, but maybe a few times?
I think so.
I can&#39;t remember ever having the flu in over 50 years since I started working, but about 5 or 6 years ago, I had my antibody levels tested at the city center and they were sufficient.
I also had no recollection of getting the vaccine, but I think I probably had contracted the flu without knowing it and developed antibodies without knowing it.

I&#39;m not a beginner, and I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m very good at it, but I&#39;ve gained weight recently so I&#39;m thinking of giving it a try as a way to lose weight. What do you think?
There are many such clubs, and if someone invites me, I&#39;ll go and play basketball.
Of course, there are places where beginners are welcome too.
When I watch Showa-era car commercials on YouTube, it seems to me that they stimulate purchasing power along with the music, but would you say that old car commercials were good or clever?
I thought the Honda commercial was good.
It seems to me that car commercials in the Showa era did not actively use popular actors and actresses like they do today.
Yes, there were a lot of commercials featuring celebrities.
The atmosphere was definitely much more stylish than it is now.
This happened a while ago, but it&#39;s been bothering me ever since, so I&#39;d appreciate your help.

Once lymph nodes become swollen, how long does it take to heal?
I guess it depends on the cause of the swelling.
If it&#39;s caused by an infection like a cold, I think you&#39;ll catch it again once the cold has subsided to a certain extent.
If the swelling is severe and there is pain, the doctor said that it won&#39;t get better without taking antibiotics, so it might be best to go to the hospital.
Can you run further than a fifth grader?
Absolutely not!!
Isn&#39;t Vegeta from Dragon Ball kind of cute?

There are towns that pay 500 yen in condolence money when a resident dies, but would you pay 500 yen for someone you have no contact with?

Manga...will you read it even if the drawings are bad, as long as the story is interesting?
Do you want to continue reading?
(;_;) Even someone as terrible at manga as me...!
This is just a rough sketch and I haven&#39;t decided on the character design yet, but I&#39;m planning on making it dark from the first page!
A manga is only good if it is accompanied by artistic skill.
If the drawings are poor, I won&#39;t even pick it up.
Do you get angry if your wife sometimes tries to get by with frozen meals for dinner?
First of all, I worry about my health.
It&#39;s fine if they can make tasty frozen meals well, but I&#39;d be upset if they were obviously bad or unpalatable.
We might work together to find better tasting frozen foods and ways to make them more efficient.
A simple question.

You should analyze why you failed and try to avoid making the same mistake again.
Rikkyo University&#39;s Ikeda Yosuke has declared his desire to go professional, so is he aiming to become the 17th professional baseball player to graduate from Chiben Wakayama High School?
He apparently started to pay more attention to the idea after his Rikkyo senior, Yasumasa Shoji, was selected as the first draft pick by Rakuten last year.
183cm, 92kg, left/right, pitcher.
He has a fastball that reaches a maximum speed of 150 km/h and also has a variety of breaking balls, including a slider, curve, changeup, fork, and two-seam.

Or how about changing into a more streamlined top?

The indoor unit&#39;s fan draws air in through the air intake and expels it through the air outlet.
When changing the air temperature, the outdoor unit turns on to activate the heat exchanger, but if you are only blowing air, there is no need for this, so the outdoor unit is not involved.
If I ask a supermarket clerk for a case of giant ice cream cones, will they sell them to me?
They will likely be able to accommodate you if they have stock in the back room and it won&#39;t affect the number of items they have on display in the store, but whether it&#39;s not just giant corn but also batteries, sweets, or bread, it&#39;s best to contact them in advance to make a reservation as each store has their own schedules.
When I ordered 30 ice creams to give to my children&#39;s club activities, I asked in advance.
If you know of any free location apps, please let me know.
My child now has a smartphone and I want to be able to check his/her location.
I downloaded an app called &quot;Cocodayo,&quot; but after a month I had to pay again.
Please let me know if there are any free location checking apps.
You can use Google Maps&#39; location sharing feature for free.
Where is a shopping mall where you can have fun without getting bored?
What is your favourite shopping centre?
I only go there occasionally, but it&#39;s Apita.
It&#39;s a large shopping mall with a wide variety of shops so you can have fun.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, we held a variety of events.
During sales, I can buy clothes and bags at a very reasonable price, which is very helpful ^ - ^
What kind of pillow is good for rounded shoulders, stiff neck, stiff shoulders, etc.?
If possible, I would like it to be under 5,000 yen.
It is said that a folded bath towel is the ideal height and softness for a pillow.
Can I contact the bank to find out how many accounts I have with the same bank?
If it&#39;s in your name, they&#39;ll tell you if you show them your ID.
No other people&#39;s accounts allowed.
They grew all around the home vegetable garden.
Is it a type of chive?
The flower part is not clear, so it is difficult to understand.
Isn&#39;t it garlic chives?
It is an invasive species and is known to be a highly prolific weed.
If you have edible chives, tear off a leaf and you will smell the distinctive chive scent.
Please note that the garlic chives are not edible.
In this day and age, is it bad manners to brush your teeth in the bathroom after eating at a restaurant?
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable.
I just think he&#39;s a very meticulous person.
What do you think of people who play Breakout games?
Is it because it&#39;s fun?
When you succeed at breaking down a block, it feels great and you get a sense of superiority.
Because it&#39;s fun after all?
It requires some brainpower, but it&#39;s fun!!!
Has it been confirmed that the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and Orix Buffaloes will be in the A class of the Pacific League for the 2022 season?
Please let me know if you know.
These two teams are a sure thing.
We&#39;re in the middle of the race for the championship.
Sugarvine.
I grow houseplants indoors.
Recently, I noticed some brown or reddish markings on the surface of the leaves.
Please tell me if the leaves are burned or moldy.
It&#39;s spreading day by day.
We recommend liquid fertiliser to prevent pests.
In any case, the key is to provide nutrition during periods of high activity and build up resistance.
What happens if you cook rice with the lid open?
It probably won&#39;t work.
If it moves, the moisture will evaporate and it will become brittle.
Even if you cook rice in a frying pan, you still need to keep the lid on.
Is the UK/Ireland?
Although they are both Christian countries, they are separate nations due to different denominations (England = Church of England, Ireland = Catholic).
I&#39;m looking for a gaming router that doesn&#39;t support Wi-Fi 6 and has a good reputation for wireless LAN.
Due to various circumstances, construction cannot be carried out, so I am well aware that it would be meaningless unless it is Wi-Fi 6.
If you know of anything that looks good, please let me know.
Thank you.
It is now difficult to find a product that does not support Wi-Fi6.
Since it is compatible with unsupported devices as well, I think Wi-Fi 6 products are a good choice.
Does the Tokaido Shinkansen slow down at Yamashina when arriving in Kyoto?
Naturally, the train slows down just before Yamashina.
The distance between Kyoto and Yamashina is only 5.5 km.
If you were traveling at 280 km/h, it would take you one to one and a half minutes to reach that distance.
Even though it&#39;s delicious, why do so few people put mayonnaise on yakitori?
Because many people don&#39;t think it tastes good.
Was Porno Graffitti&#39;s CD single released on Wednesday, July 13, 2022?
Please let me know if you know.
It is not on sale yet.
Their last CD single was their 51st, [Theme Song], released on Wednesday September 22nd last year.
It reached number 2 on the Oricon charts.
It&#39;s June now, so it&#39;s okay to wear off-the-shoulder clothing, right?
The kimono is now a summer kimono, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strange.
It depends on the weather that day
What does &quot;chanchan&quot; mean at the end of a sentence? Thank you in advance m(_ _)m
This is one of the gags in Yoshimoto Shinkigeki.
It&#39;s the sound that signals the end of a joke.
What did you eat for breakfast on Friday, May 6, 2022?
I made a sandwich with gyoza and ham between six slices of bread, toasted it, and ate it with coffee; it was delicious.
Even though there are free music apps available, are there really people who download them?
Yes there is.
I buy songs by artists I like or want to support.
I also buy CDs.
There are many different convenience stores in Japan, such as 7-Eleven, Family Mart, Lawson, Mini Stop, and Seico Mart, but do you have a favorite?
please tell me!
The place I go to most often is 7-ELEVEN.
Because it&#39;s next to my house.
My favorite is Natural Lawson.
Do you eat convenience store sweets?
I like pudding and jelly, so I eat them often (⁠^⁠^⁠)
training
Is it better to do strength training before or after a meal?
Training on an empty stomach (when you&#39;re depleted of energy) can lead to muscle loss
Taking in nutrients (mainly protein) after training helps muscles grow
So, if you&#39;re serious about training, you need to refuel both before and after training.
But if I had to choose between before or after, I&#39;d rather eat before training.
On Facebook, Instagram, etc., do you like your friends who don&#39;t like you back?
I&#39;ll do it if I think it&#39;s good for me.
I believe that a &quot;like&quot; is not something that is reciprocated, but something you do if you really like the post or information.
I don&#39;t really care if other people like it or not.
People say that Cretans are liars. Are Cretans honest?
It&#39;s a paradox problem.
If you are an honest person, you become a liar, and if you are a liar, you are lying.
If I had to buy one of these three games, Dragon Quest Theatrhythm, Rhythm Heaven Wii, or Wario Land Shake, which one would you recommend?
I recommend Theatrhythm.
What are the economic effects of reducing working hours?
According to reports from companies that have implemented reductions in working hours, many of their employees have reported that the reduced hours have led them to work more efficiently on their own, which has resulted in improved company performance.
As business performance improves, salaries rise and people get more holidays, which in turn increases consumption, which also has an economic effect.
Does increasing the air pressure in winter tires affect driving on snowy roads?
Will higher air pressure improve fuel economy a little?
Do I have to set it pretty high?
I think the rolling resistance will be better.
Studless tires are low-pressure tires, so if you increase the pressure, they won&#39;t grip the snow and they&#39;ll be more likely to burst, which is not a good thing.
I&#39;ve never received the best answer.
How can I get the best answer?
I don&#39;t notice it, but I get it sometimes.
First of all, I answer sincerely to people who ask serious questions. I put myself in the other person&#39;s shoes and think carefully before answering.
I think about what the best response would be to the other person.
That may be what&#39;s best for the person asking the question.
For your reference.
After I lift my eyelashes, they fall down. I would like to know how to keep them lifted.
Apply mascara, let it dry, then add a little curve to your lashes in three stages.
If you apply mascara first, it becomes like glue, or has a firm, hardened feel, so if you then curl your lashes, they will stay in place more easily.
It looks nice if you divide it into three stages.
Please tell me about any useful lifestyle improvements that you wish you had made sooner.
Futon dryer
I never thought it would be this good.
Your futon will be fluffy and freshly hung out to dry!
During this time, you can get a blissful sleep.
As shown in the photo, are the AKB48 Team 8 costumes worn at Odaiba United States 2013?
Also, will you wear it on Eighth Day?
That must be it, as there are photos of her in the same costume from Daiba United States 2013.
I wasn&#39;t sure if it was worn on Eighth Day.
Please tell me your favorite soba and udon noodles.
The soba is Zaru Soba.
I also like grated yam soba noodles.
The udon is tempura udon.
Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m poor, but shrimp tempura udon is a real treat for me.
Too persistent
It&#39;s been going on since about 1:30.

I put in earplugs but they had no effect. I couldn&#39;t hear anything at all.
The painful and difficult hell of not being able to sleep really does exist
Just how long will this continue???
Isn&#39;t this what they call spring thunder and snow removal?
It will be over soon
I&#39;ve been to several different dentists in the past, but when you sit in that treatment chair, the dentist and dental hygienist talk to you from behind you at a slight angle.
I wonder if I should turn around to look behind me, but it would be hard and tiring to keep looking behind me, and I also think it would be rude to keep facing forward.
Does anyone know?
What are you doing?
Not only at the dentist, but also at the barber or perm shop, you should face forward when speaking.
Which material is cooler: 100% polyester or dry rayon?
Dry rayon is excellent and cool
please tell me
I joined the company in April.
How can I become a better person in the world?
thank you
Rather than thinking about becoming someone who is good at getting along with people, the key right now is to quickly master the job you&#39;ve been given and become an asset to the company.
Is your stomach clock accurate?
The only things that have never gone wrong are my internal clock and stomach clock.
The surface panel of the bathroom sink door has come off and I would like to have it repaired, but which repair shop should I ask?
Please let me know.
There are decorative panels available at home improvement stores, so I can measure the size, cut it, and repair and replace it myself.
When you go to the tax office to submit your tax return documents, they don&#39;t have to be printed in color, right?
yes
When will the amount I claimed in my tax return at the beginning of the year be deposited into my account?
I think the money will be transferred within 2 or 3 weeks.
You will first receive a postcard informing you that the money will be transferred, so when you receive it, please record the information in your bankbook, as the money will have been transferred.
For now, all you can do is wait for the postcard (notification).
How can I check my LINE ID?

If it has not been set, it can be set only once.
Can I purchase a ticketless express ticket on E5489 using a VISA LINE PAY prepaid card?
Good evening.
JR West&#39;s &quot;e5489&quot; &quot;Ticketless Express Tickets&quot; can be paid for by credit card.
Prepaid cards cannot be used.
It&#39;s been a while since the date, do you think it&#39;s okay?
It&#39;s vegetable juice.
It depends on how it&#39;s stored.
If it has been kept in the refrigerator all along, it can still be drunk even after two or three days, but if it has been left outside or at room temperature, it is probably best to dispose of it.
It would be a big problem if something were to happen to your body later.
Why is Saruhara Shinichi, the monkey brother from &quot;Abatarou Don Brothers,&quot; able to eat and drink at &quot;Cafe Donbura&quot; even though he is unemployed?

Can I enjoy the movie The Promised Neverland just as a movie, even if I don&#39;t know the plot?
You can enjoy it.
Because it&#39;s a simple story.
May I write a story about escaping from a monster that feeds on humans?
I think nurses wear casual clothes when they go to work, but is it okay to wear sandals and bare feet?
Well, you&#39;ll be changing clothes anyway, so as long as you wear something that&#39;s easy to wear to work and doesn&#39;t look weird, it should be fine, right?
I envy people who have houses where no one ever comes, but are there any disadvantages to living in a house like that?
You will no longer clean the house regularly.
Hospitality for customers also becomes unfamiliar.
About Instagram.
I (an ordinary person) currently have about 10,000 followers, but if people who don&#39;t know me saw this, would they think, Wow, that&#39;s amazing?
Or do you not think anything of it?
What is it like?
I think it&#39;s amazing.
For ordinary people, it&#39;s a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
Problems and setbacks
I don&#39;t have much time to exercise so I bought some compression innerwear to try out the latest trend.
My body size is H175m W80kg and I purchased the L size.
It&#39;s quite difficult to put on at first, but once you get used to it you&#39;ll be fine.
I used it for a few days, but then I had some problems so now I&#39;m using a different compression innerwear.
The problem is that unless your arms are quite slim, the edges of the sleeves (around the upper arms) feel too tight, causing congestion and itching.
2. The lower abdomen feels loose. I stopped using it due to these two issues.
It&#39;s quite tight to wear, but you can sleep in it without any problems.
Good value for the right person
Even though I am 158cm and 50kg, size S was fine.
However, it didn&#39;t suit me because I have a large, muscular frame.
Since the buttocks and other parts are not three-dimensional, there are strange gaps and it tends to slip down, so it doesn&#39;t feel right.
It always felt like I had to pull it up.
I think it would be good for someone with a stick-like body type.
In terms of thickness, I would say it&#39;s thin enough to be reassuring.
They don&#39;t feel flimsy or like they&#39;re about to rip, and I was able to tuck them into tight-fitting knee-high boots, giving them a neat look.
It&#39;s nice
I didn&#39;t want to show too much skin on my upper body, but I was looking for something different from fitness swimsuits and that&#39;s when I came across this.
The top is stylish with its lace-up back and a small mark on the hem.
I&#39;m happy that I can choose between a bikini underneath or shorts over it (^.
^) I only just received it, and have only tried it on and not put it in water, so I don&#39;t know how durable it is or how it will feel when wet, but the stitching is beautiful, the fabric is sturdy, and for the price, I think it&#39;s a good deal.
It said there were no wires in the bust area, but when I touched it, I could feel a hard core underneath the padding.
However, it doesn&#39;t hurt when I wear it and it fits my bust nicely, so I think it will look good when I move around.
Has the model been changed from one without padding to one with padding?
(^.
^) Now I&#39;m looking forward to getting in the water♪ Thank you♪
45kg 156cm M size is a little big.
The raincoat is made of thick fabric so it can feel muggy, but it is well-made so I think it will last for a long time.
It has two rain visors to protect your face from getting wet.
There was no problem with its strength, and I was able to use it safely even when riding my bike in a strong wind.
It never broke after use.
I pack it in a compression bag to keep it compact and easy to carry.
It really exceeded my expectations at this price.
It was installed successfully.
Installed on a 2016 CLA 180 Shooting Brake.
Even an amateur can learn how to install it by watching YouTube or reading the instructions.
Be careful not to loosen the Torx screws too much as they will fall into the car.
I dropped one and it went missing.
Furthermore, when you are clamping the grey connector between the brown, red and green wires and crimping them, if you use a pair of pliers with a tapered tip such as needle-nose pliers, the force will not be applied evenly and the plastic will crack as shown in the picture, making it impossible to attach.
When I called support, they mailed me a new cable the next day, so they are a company that provides very good support.
When I tried again, I was able to successfully crimp it using wide pliers as shown in the instruction manual, applying a lot of force all at once.
When putting the last main unit back into the car, it was a bit tricky to store the wiring, but I managed to get it installed.
After installation, I can watch DVD, TV and navigation without any problems while driving.
I think this is a product with excellent cost performance, as it would cost over 80,000 yen if you ordered it at a dealer, and over 40,000 yen even at a specialty store.
Below the price
Honestly, I don&#39;t know why it has such high ratings. First of all, the filling inside is polyester, but it has been cut inside the cushion, so there are fluffy areas and loose areas. It looks like it has already been worn out. Or rather, there is not much filling overall, and after trying it out, I thought that with products where the head and body pillow parts are integrated, you may not like it unless you try it out. For me, I think it&#39;s better to have the pillow and body pillow separate so you can&#39;t go wrong. I bought it on a limited sale for 3,600 yen, but I want to return it. I&#39;ve realized that I should have been more wary of 5-star reviews in the first place.
Neither good nor bad
The product has arrived.
I was able to use it right away.
There are no problems with the feel and I can express milk properly.
However, I feel that the noise is a little loud and the power button is sometimes unresponsive.
It doesn&#39;t bother me as I can use it without any problems, but it might bother some people.
It&#39;s not super quiet 😅 You might be a bit concerned about using it at night.
Also, I was worried whether the part that connects the included tube to the machine would fit into the tube, but it just pushed in 😂 It&#39;s lightweight, so I think it&#39;s easy to carry around!
You need some tips to make the foam...
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because my hair type is incompatible with this shampoo or if there&#39;s a problem with the shampoo&#39;s performance, but with normal use it hardly lathers at all.
(The shampoo I had been using up until then lathered up without any problems when used normally.) So, here&#39;s the solution I found: 1) First, take a smaller amount of shampoo than usual in your hand and rub it all over your hair.
(At this point, it will not lather to the point where not even a single bubble appears.) 2) Rinse your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo in your hands and work it into your hair.
(Now it finally lathers normally) Basically, it&#39;s a double wash haha. The volume of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to use as little shampoo as possible the first time... I&#39;m happy with the effect of the shampoo itself.
I&#39;ve obviously bought a pricey shampoo, but my hair definitely feels better.
But to be honest, overall I wasn&#39;t satisfied.
It&#39;s a shame, as I&#39;ve been really fond of the Quattro Botanico face wash products...
Despite the small capacity, you have to wash it twice, which is poor value for money.
Furthermore, considering that the scent is unlikely to appeal to everyone, I will be a bit strict and give it two stars.
Evaluation is difficult
There are negative and positive aspects, so it&#39;s difficult to evaluate.
Only a blade cleaner will clean the surface of the blade.
I think it matches well with razors that have high inherent blade precision.
Positive: As intended, it removes dirt such as sebum and soap scum from the blade.
(Only on the front side) If the dirt has caused the blade to lose its sharpness, it will last longer.
Negative: The lifespan of the lubricant is drastically reduced.
If the cutting edge is coated with titanium or ceramic, the coating will easily peel off.
(After using the shaver 2-3 times, most of the coating will come off, so I recommend using this cleaner after that.
Be careful with razors that say not to wipe the blade.
) I&#39;ve heard that it can be replaced with anti-tip rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that is placed under furniture etc. as part of earthquake preparedness, so I&#39;m not sure how cost-effective it is.
*When I use it, I find that it increases the lifespan of my razor by 20-30%.
It&#39;s difficult to determine when it&#39;s time to throw away a razor blade, but I think it&#39;s when the blade has been damaged by shaving and the cutting edge has become dull.
In that sense, I think it&#39;s a good product because it prevents the sharpness from decreasing due to dirt.
(The cleaner does not have a sharpening effect. Sometimes it feels like it is being sharpened, but this is probably because small pieces of rust have been removed.)
Attracted by a TV commercial...
I saw a TV commercial where an older woman&#39;s face was brightened after just one application, so I decided to buy it.
When I actually tried using it, I found that the texture was a little harder than regular gel, so I wiped it off with a pre-lotion before using it.
At first it feels sticky and unpleasant, but if you massage it in, it actually gets absorbed into your skin.
After applying, there was almost no stickiness and it felt like my skin was sticking to my hands.
As for the lifting, it didn&#39;t go as smoothly as it did on TV.
I felt the firmness immediately.
I have extremely dry skin, so this alone isn&#39;t enough for me, so I use a certain Moisture Surge 72 before using this.
It feels just moisturizing.
I was hoping it would cover the sagging pores, but it doesn&#39;t.
I&#39;ll try one bottle and see if it works, and if so, I&#39;d consider buying it again.
It must have been a difficult task to put together...
This is a painstaking work that looks back and compiles statements made by politicians over the past few years.
As I read, I somehow come to understand what that statement meant at that time.
However, when considering the book&#39;s value as a reading material, it is unclear whether what the authors call &quot;fact checking&quot; is sufficient.
To be honest, it&#39;s not fun to read.
After thinking about it a lot, I came to the conclusion that the biggest flaw in this book is its &quot;method.&quot;
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call &quot;facts&quot; here will remain facts forever.
Judging from the way they wrote, I had serious doubts as to whether they were aware of the fragility of &quot;fact checking&quot; (or perhaps its falsification).
It&#39;s a little disheartening to see that today&#39;s Japanese journalists have this level of understanding of &quot;facts.&quot;
It seems to be recommended by many people, but it may be suitable for those who want to gain some knowledge about the subjects covered in this book.
If, like the reviewer, there are readers who are interested in the &quot;fact-checking&quot; currently being conducted by the Japanese media, this book may not be for you.
For those who can&#39;t improve their scores on mock exams.
At my school, political science and economics were taught in handout format, and the class format felt like I was being forced to study, which was really boring, and before I knew it, I had come to dislike political science and economics.
To be honest, this guidebook saved me.
He is currently a third year high school student and is the center this year.
Since I bought it in March, I&#39;ve chosen it as my study partner for the hour I spend going to and from school.
My first impression can be summed up in one word: easy to understand.
You have reached the realm of the gods.
After going through the exam once, I took some past exam questions and got 70, whereas my average score at the time was 40.
I was actually surprised myself.
It stretches so much that you wonder if you&#39;ve eaten something strange.
What I gained from this reference book was not just knowledge and information about politics and economics; I also felt a synergistic improvement in my own abilities and motivation to study.
I am truly grateful that we had the opportunity to meet.
Crime Prevention
Eight years ago, I experienced two attempted lock-pickings at my front door, and have since taken measures to prevent theft.
This time I am replacing the camera I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, I was using a 30m infrared type (from another company).
As others have written, this product can only recognize faces at night at a distance of about 5m.
I agree.
It has just arrived and I haven&#39;t set it up yet, but I have compared the camera image quality and checked for any problems.
The image quality is much better than cameras from 8 years ago (obviously).
I displayed it in 4 parts on a 32-inch monitor, and there was no problem if I maximized the shooting size.
So far there are no problems with the product.
If you are looking for a camera that can recognize faces in addition to providing security, you may be disappointed with the night-time footage, but for this price it is top-notch!
I use it for security purposes, but I don&#39;t require facial recognition.
This is because it is difficult to tell if they are wearing a mask (especially at night).
Professional burglars are knowledgeable about security cameras.
Even though it is small, it can apparently distinguish between high-performance cameras and recordings.
On the other hand, it can be a problem if you&#39;re not a professional.
However, since burglars these days are bold and sophisticated, we recommend not relying solely on cameras, but using them in conjunction with various other security devices.
For example, there is a white solar LED garden light that can be purchased at a home improvement store for around 1,500 yen (the latest one is very bright and comes with six lights).
Since it is solar powered, there are no electricity bills, but in winter it does not turn on until morning, so we also have three 100V LED motion sensor lights installed.
With this combination, we were able to ensure that human shadows could be recognized at a distance of 30m.
Also, for daytime security, if you feel that the camera&#39;s small size reduces its deterrent effect, you may need to find a way to cover it.
I have a sticker that says &quot;Security cameras in operation 24 hours a day.&quot;
This is an original product from the security camera manufacturer I used previously.
Manufacturer&#39;s products are more effective than products sold at home improvement stores.
The places to stick the stickers are places where thieves could enter that would not be covered by camera photography.
In that sense, I wish I had a sticker this time.
Also, the instructions for setting up the internet were difficult to understand, so I gave it a minus.
If there are any problems after setup and configuration, we will update you.
I empathize so much that it hurts to read it.
Those born in 1982 in Japan may be in a slightly better social situation than her, but even though the Equal Employment Opportunity Law has been enacted, the situation is still far from equal.
As I read on, I realized, ``Yes, that&#39;s right, it really was like that,&#39;&#39; and painful memories of surviving discrimination as a member of society came back to me, and I felt suffocated.
It depicts the suffering faced not only by women in Korea and Japan, but by all women in feudal societies who try to live as human beings rather than as women.
Isn&#39;t it time for at least women to stop their emotional conflicts and join arms to face this society?
Dramas that make you think &quot;men are the worst&quot;
The story revolves around a protagonist who was sexually abused by his own father as a child.
Naturally, they continue to carry those scars even as adults.
All the guys that appear are the worst.
The protagonist&#39;s husband, who appears to be gentle and caring towards his family, is also in some ways the worst.
Contains spoilers ↓ The story is frustrating for the men in the story, such as the fact that the protagonist&#39;s sister is being abused by her husband but he ignores her, and when her sister-in-law finally gathers up the courage to go to the police to report her husband, the protagonist&#39;s husband, who is a police officer, just ignores her.
The protagonist&#39;s elderly mother, who pretends to be senile, knows that her husband (the protagonist&#39;s biological father) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter is unaware of this (officially, the father&#39;s death is said to be a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of her rapist, the daughter never received counseling, so it&#39;s no surprise that the protagonist goes crazy.
Why does the protagonist&#39;s daughter keep asking about her dead grandfather?
Do you care about so many old men who died at such a young age?
There are too many &quot;?&quot;s in the drama.
A few years ago, a heat wave hit France in the summer, and many elderly people died.When hospitals and facilities contacted their parents, many of them said they couldn&#39;t take the bodies because they were on vacation, and it was reported that Paris morgues became full.
These people are &quot;dry.&quot;
When I saw her husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that it was indeed a &quot;dry&quot; story.
French films are completely different from American films, and many of them have ambiguous parts that create a good aftertaste, but there were quite a few scenes that I thought would have been better cut, so I watched the film by fast-forwarding.
Professional boundaries
If an unexpected accident that could not be predicted even with meticulous calculations involved someone&#39;s life, then even if they had calculated it to some extent from the beginning, they would have been prepared to risk their own life for it.
The script was superb, embodying the subtle drama of her inner conflict, which she struggles with and hides from public view, and the extent to which she will deceive those around her in order to get her own beliefs across.
That being said...Jessica&#39;s acting is absolutely amazing.
No matter what you look at, you can&#39;t go wrong.
This is truly professional work.
After use it broke
I&#39;ve used three so far, but this one broke in no time, for better or worse.
What prompted me to choose this product was that my first vaporizer had a built-in 2200mAh output, but the battery ran out after three 5-minute sessions at 200 degrees.
The second USB port is faulty.
Charging becomes impossible.
This time, this product was meant to solve the problems I had been having up until now, but after replacing the battery about 15 times (I was using the battery on a charger to prevent the USB terminal from breaking), it became difficult to turn on, perhaps due to a poor connection.
Press the lid to turn the power on.
I&#39;m sure some iQOS users have experienced this.
That&#39;s the symptom.
As stated in the instructions, do not use any batteries other than those provided.
The claws and catches appear to be machined, so there doesn&#39;t seem to be any bending.
So I returned it within about 10 days.
At the same time as returning the product, I purchased the Starry version without the logo, and I will compare it to this one here.
They look and feel the same size.
The chamber and draw are the same too.
LCD This one is clearer.
It might be newer than the one without the logo.
Vibe This one is subdued.
Like the vibration on a smartphone.
Without the logo, the vibration or noise is louder.
A cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also from China...
The accessories are slightly different.
This comes with a liquid case.
Without the logo it&#39;s a lump like steel wool.
That&#39;s roughly it.
I think Starly would have been better, but if it breaks down quickly, it loses credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but the only option was to return it, so even though it was a hassle, I went ahead with the process.
It&#39;s just ear elastic, but it&#39;s important
These rubber bands really don&#39;t hurt.
It is the most comfortable on the ears of any similar mask I have used so far.
Even flat elastic bands can easily twist, and the twisted edges can rub against the base of the ear, making them more painful than round elastic bands, but this product is not only soft to the touch, but I think its length is just right to prevent it from twisting.
It fits well to the face, and not only does it fit well, but there is also a moderate amount of space between the nose wire and the bottom edge that goes over the chin, in front of the mouth, so you don&#39;t feel short of breath.
This may be because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don&#39;t know if it will suit everyone equally, but if you&#39;ve tried other smaller sizes and found them to be lacking, I recommend giving this one a try.
When you open the outer box, you&#39;ll find them in plastic with a slit in the middle, like a tissue box. When I tried to take out the first one, the elastic bands on both sides got caught and made it difficult to remove, so I deducted one star for that.
The company&#39;s response was 1 star.
The price and taste were perfect, but I was distrustful of the company&#39;s behavior as they ignored my request for delivery by a specific date.
In addition to this product, I also bought a bunch of drinks.
I always buy from Amazon, so I know the delivery person.
We tried to coordinate the arrival dates as much as possible since they would be carrying particularly heavy items up high, but this has all been ruined.
They say that Amazon is causing a hard time for delivery companies, but I&#39;m hoping that there&#39;s at least one thing that users can do to help.
I am disappointed with the arrogant attitude of the vendor.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering purchasing, include disposal costs.
There are many complaints and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to use it for long.
I think it&#39;s a good idea to consider the cost of disposal as well.
For your reference, some local governments have centers that will accept large pieces of garbage brought to them for free or at low cost.
[Comfort] The seat is tilted slightly to the left and is wobbly, so it is very tiring to sit on.
The slightest movement creates a loud creaking noise.
It&#39;s too noisy at night to use.
This is my biggest concern and I feel I can&#39;t continue using it.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are just rough pictorial explanations.
The information necessary for assembly is lacking, and there are many errors.
- There is no explanation about the orientation of the seat and support base when installing them. Some people have written in reviews that the chair leans forward, but it&#39;s possible that the orientation of the seat and support base when installing them is reversed.
When installed correctly, the height adjustment lever will be on the right hand side, facing backwards, and the dial for adjusting the angle of the rear spring will be at the front.
However, since it is more natural for the height adjustment lever to face forward, many people will install it incorrectly.
The instructions don&#39;t include any of these basic warnings, so you have to assemble it by trial and error while looking at rough drawings.
- There is an error in the description of the contents. The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers are unable to find the 12 8 x 20 mm screws that are included and end up searching for them.
The 8 x 20 mm screws are already inserted into the chair, so be careful not to waste time searching for them.
The machining precision is low, and it seems that even with the same screw holes and screws, there are some combinations that can be inserted and some that cannot.
With some combinations, it can be very difficult to even insert the screws into the screw holes.
Therefore, it is possible that the device is shipped with the screws still inserted like this.
Also, I couldn&#39;t find the spare screws mentioned in the instructions.
[Other] The black part of the vinyl leather surface has uneven coloring and is whitish in places, so don&#39;t expect it to be as beautiful as the product photo.
An explanation of the deficiencies in the instructions and additional information on the installation method mentioned above was sent to the email address registered with Amazon within 2-3 days of the product arriving.
Ideally, this should be done immediately after the product is shipped.
This is completely pointless since most buyers will have completed assembly within 2-3 days of receiving the product.
Hmm...
I&#39;m a big fan of Thermos and have been using Thermos straw-type water bottles for over 15 years, but this model is by far the hardest to use of all the ones I&#39;ve used.
① The straw spout part is now made of a harder material and the groove fits snugly into the main body, so the straw spout part can no longer be removed from the main body!
I tried so hard to remove it that my nails broke!
②The tip of the drinking mouth of the straw has become thinner than before, so the straw brush can no longer fit inside.
3) The mysterious valve at the end of the straw is thicker than a straw brush, making it extremely difficult to clean.
I&#39;m a bit shocked because I&#39;ve never had any complaints about using straw-type bottles until now.
It&#39;s really frustrating that the drinking spout cannot be removed from the main body.
The best thing about it is that it still has excellent cooling power.
I forgot to take it out of my bag, and when I washed it the next day, about 50% of the ice I put in the day before was still there.
I don&#39;t drink hot drinks, so I&#39;ll continue to use the straw type.
Please improve it in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
This is my first review.
(These are the thoughts of an amateur who has little knowledge about purchasing a doll from scratch and attaching doll eyes for the first time.) The product I received was exactly as pictured.
When I attached it to my Obitsu doll, it looked very cute and the light was great, so I was very happy.
However, the opening is a little stiff and you have to push it in with force to put it on.
I think this is a different way to do it, but I used tweezers to push them into the holes in the doll eyes.
Regarding shipping: Since this was my first time receiving a shipment from overseas, I expected it to take three weeks, but it arrived in just eight days (Narita Airport is close), which was faster than I expected.
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
I just checked the shipping information on Amazon and it says it&#39;s still being shipped.
There was absolutely no damage or air in the eyes, and it was in a small sealed bag with lots of bubble wrap on the back of the envelope, so I think it&#39;s safe to say.
However, the phone number was printed on the envelope, so I was wondering if my personal information was safe even though it was mailed from overseas?
I have some doubts about this, so I&#39;ll give it a minus 1.
The product is fine and I think it&#39;s a great deal for the amount at that price.
Additional information Doll Eye 8mm Model iPhonese
A little small (narrow working area), heavy static electricity
I checked the size chart before ordering, but it ended up being about two sizes smaller than I had imagined.
Although it is larger than A4 size, the outer circumference has grooves for storing parts, so the area that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I was planning to use it for repairing electronic devices and building Gundam models, but it&#39;s difficult to use without the B4 size.
It might be fine if you only use it for soldering iron work and use a separate tray or mat for other tasks such as assembly and disassembly.
It&#39;s impossible to place tools, parts, and do more work in an area the size of a magazine.
I thought about ordering another one of the same item to double the area, but it gets so statically charged while working, and it keeps sticking to dust and pieces of cut parts, so I&#39;m worried it might be difficult to keep using it.
Fatal defect
After struggling to open the battery box lid, I finally managed to use a rubber anti-slip sheet to open it, but when I put the batteries in and tried to close it, it wouldn&#39;t close no matter what I did.
At this point you&#39;re out.
Highly rated!
Does the battery box cover close?
Additionally, instead of a protective sticker on the product there was a squishy little piece of plastic wrap on it.
Is this a second-hand item?
The only instructions were in English written densely on a small piece of paper.
There are no illustrated instructions and I have no idea how to operate it.
Maybe it would be better on another finger...
I found a good product!
I thought so and bought it immediately.
I use it as a pinky ring, so I have to use a lot of them to get a snug fit, and it feels a bit bulky.
But I think it&#39;s fine for other fingers.
But I think he’s a good idea merchant.
For the price
You really shouldn&#39;t expect quality from this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was missing.
When I tried it on, the size was just right.
Might be a bit difficult for people with thick earlobes though.
In fact, I probably should have bought one without a pattern.
That&#39;s bad
The design is nice, but it&#39;s too big when worn on the hand. I wonder if the effect will be diminished if worn on the foot?
In eastern Hokkaido during the harsh winter...
As other reviewers have said, the heating wire is only 110 x 80 net size and is arranged horizontally rather than vertically.
I wanted to warm the entire futon evenly, so I bought this one, which is more expensive than the mattress type but is bigger, so I guess it can&#39;t be helped since you can&#39;t check it out in store like you can with the famous brands.
The only way to use it is to combine a hot water bottle with Otori&#39;s N Warm.
By the way, the quality of the blankets is out of the question.
It&#39;s well done but
It&#39;s small and has plenty of airflow.
The battery can also be replaced with a spare.
If you place it on a desk and adjust the angle, it works best as shown in the photo.
If it&#39;s on a smooth desk, the wind will blow it away, but if you put a handkerchief down it&#39;s not a problem.
When using it outside or at a family restaurant, the noise is unnoticeable even at the &quot;medium&quot; setting, but in the office, even the &quot;low&quot; setting is too loud.
You just need to accept it as a companion when you go out.
Also, for office use, even the &quot;small&quot; setting has too much airflow and is too cold.
It&#39;s perfect for those situations when you&#39;re out and about and break out into a sweat, then rush into a family restaurant and cool down quickly with a &quot;large&quot; drink.
The only thing is that when you throw it into your bag, the power button sometimes gets pressed and starts running without you realizing it.
It would be nice if there were some clever ideas such as slightly retracting (depressing) the button or making the first soft press longer.
It&#39;s an essential item during these life-threatening heatwaves, so it would be great if they could make a better one.
Multi-function light speaker
I set it to the weakest warm color and use it in my bedroom.
Better than I expected!
I&#39;m glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color by touch.
The white color matches any room, and the colored lights change in gradients, which is beautiful.
Also, if you touch your favorite color, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it light up according to your mood!
Since it is LED type, you can expect a long life.
As for the sound quality, I think it&#39;s more than satisfactory to my amateur ears.
What&#39;s great about this light is how versatile it is.
- There is a large speaker on the top.
You can pair it with your mobile phone etc. via Bluetooth, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
・If you pair it with your mobile phone, you can make hands-free calls.
It also supports MicroSD, so you can connect it to your computer and use it as an MP3 player to play music.
Recording and piano practice
At the age of 66, he began experimenting with DTM to prevent dementia.
I purchased an audio interface and this unit.
At first I was doing programming, but then I got hooked on playing the piano and now I practice every day.
I downloaded the sound source that was provided, but the protection didn&#39;t work properly, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but the free piano sound source had a good sound, so I use that for piano practice.
I&#39;m glad I bought it.
I feel like I was deceived by appearances.
Is this a hit or miss product?
This will be a long post.
I have been using a Doshisha office chair (with flip-up armrests) for 4-5 years, but the synthetic leather has deteriorated and become worn out, so I am considering purchasing a chair with flip-up armrests made of non-synthetic leather.
I looked around at home improvement stores and furniture stores but couldn&#39;t find anything suitable.
Although I was a little worried about not being able to see the actual product, I compromised on the design and price and purchased this item on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
[Caution] The included hex wrench and screws will be sticky with oil.
At first, I didn&#39;t realize that oil was on the hex wrench, and I was worried when oil got on it because the body of the wrench was white.
Assembly completed in 40 minutes.
Completed and product checked.
The left and right flip-up armrests have different hardness when raising and lowering; the left is heavy and the right is light; the armrests are not very user-friendly (there is no way to adjust them).
The adjustable headrest has a weak fixing force and sags immediately with a clicking sound.
The seat is made of non-recycled high-density urethane foam, which feels hard and uncomfortable to sit on (is it weak in elasticity?
)The athletic mesh on the backrest is harder than other companies&#39; mesh chairs, so if you&#39;re wearing light clothing your back will hurt.
It&#39;s a minor thing, but the height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 (seat height is important for tall people). Also, the legs that support the casters are not made of steel, so durability is questionable.
I put a cushion that I purchased separately underneath it, and since the mesh fabric part seems like it will deteriorate (get damaged) quickly, I also put a towel blanket underneath it.
I am 186cm tall and weigh 80kg and the only thing I felt was that it fit well around the back, but other than that I feel like I am not very satisfied with the product and it&#39;s a hit or miss product.
After all, it may be better to see the actual office chair before buying it.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer confirming my purchase, so should I inquire about the armrests and headrest?
under consideration.
Well, I guess that&#39;s about it.
Since it seemed like I would be able to watch right-hand rotating BS4K in my home environment, I bought a cheap Pixela 4K tuner without having high expectations.
As an experiment, I was able to watch free right-turning broadcasts including NHK BS4K, and the images looked great on the Panasonic 4K TV I purchased at the same time.
(The image is sometimes jerky) Soon after I bought it an update came out that made it possible to record, so I have scheduled some recordings to watch, but perhaps due to the fact that I am using an external 2.5-inch HDD, during playback the image sometimes freezes or frames are skipped.
The user interface is by no means something to be praised, so I&#39;ve just accepted the fact that it allows me to watch 4K broadcasts.
By the way, while a scheduled recording is in progress, you can only play back the recorded program, but I accept this as a positive feature that allows me to record in 4K to the HDD.
If you buy it with high expectations, you may be disappointed, so don&#39;t expect too much.
Hopefully this will be improved with an update.
Heat retention function is OK
I&#39;ve only used the heat retention function so far, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, they were warm in about two hours and piping hot in two and a half hours.
I installed it at the passenger&#39;s feet in my compact car, and although the fan noise was noticeable when the engine was idling, I couldn&#39;t hear it at all while driving.
Perhaps because it was still new, there was a noticeable chemical-like smell coming from the fan, so I had to open the windows regularly to ventilate the room.
As another reviewer wrote in their review, the burrs on the part where the shoulder strap goes through are pretty bad, so you&#39;ll need to use a flathead screwdriver or something similar to break off the burrs.
Really fragile
It suddenly broke after just two months of use.
I liked the typing feel and the size, but it&#39;s no good if it breaks.
I use a PC all day for video processing work, and the volume keeps automatically setting to 100%.
If you lower it, it instantly goes back to 100%.
I can&#39;t use earphones because they hurt my ears, and the volume is so loud I feel uncomfortable using my PC at night.
It seems to be sending a signal every few seconds, as the volume display repeatedly appears and disappears on the computer screen.
Furthermore, the keyboard interferes with mouse commands, so you cannot use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard every time.
The Enter key and the backspace key are no longer responding.
I don&#39;t recommend it at all, but if it&#39;s in the 1,000 yen range it might be worth a try.
If you&#39;re lucky, it will last about six months.
This product comes with a 6 month warranty, compared to other brands in the same price range that only offer 1 to 3 year warranties.
The short warranty period indicates how fragile it is.
Great product, worst packaging
I love this product and it comes in different colors.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a food storage unit!!
However, the large cardboard box had gaps large enough for the item to roll around, and there was no delivery note, so the packaging was terrible.
When I opened the box the lid was missing.
I recommend this product, but you may be better off buying it elsewhere.
I&#39;m worried about the strength, but for now
I bought this because I replaced the lid and it no longer supported my needs.
It does serve the purpose of keeping the lid stable, but because it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid it will make an unpleasant crunchy noise (as if it is about to break).
Be careful when purchasing, as you need to choose one that fits the thickness of the lid.
Cute paw pads bag
I have a dog and was looking for a bag to take when going out, when I was attracted to this stylish grey bag and decided to buy it.
It is a self-assembly system, and when I picked it up, it was surprisingly light, so it didn&#39;t feel that heavy when I held it.
The zipper moves smoothly and there is no snagging.
It seems like it would be comfortable even on long trips.
It&#39;s very compact and easy to fold.
Even when folded, the paw print design is visible, so it&#39;s cute to just lay it out.
Light and comfortable!
The pulleys are easy to use and spin.
First of all, I fell in love with the look and the low price at first sight and bought it immediately!
TSA locks have been my favorite for the past few years and I have several others as well, they are very convenient.
And if you want to avoid forgetting or losing your keys, we recommend a number lock.
To be honest, I think that lightness is the most important thing for me, so it&#39;s fine, but if you want durability and security, the zipper goes all the way around and is made of cloth, so if you cut it with a knife it will break in an instant.
Also, the zipper doesn&#39;t fit properly so I&#39;d like it to be able to overlap better.
If you are traveling abroad, we recommend bringing it as carry-on luggage.
I used it on a Shinkansen trip and it was comfortable.
It&#39;s difficult to choose the size...
I have a hard time buying shoes because I have wide feet.
I wear size 24cm Converse and Vans.
MRL996 is also 24cm.
At first I thought it was tough, but once I got used to it it was fine.
My sister said that the ML574 size 24.5cm was too tight for her, so when I tried them on, they were indeed tight.
It felt like my pinky finger was touching me.
That&#39;s why I bought the 25cm.
When I received it and opened it, it was huge...
When I tried them on, they were a little loose even with socks on.
I thought about returning them, but if I got a size 24.5 and it turned out to be too tight, it would be a hassle, so I think I&#39;ll just put in a size 25 and wear them with an insole.
I bought the team red one and it&#39;s a great vibrant red!
I often wear monochrome black and white clothes, so wearing this brightens up my outfit!
165cm, male in his 40s
I ordered the L size on a whim, but if you have similar specs to those below, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Belly button circumference: 100 cm A typical metabolic syndrome belly.
&lt;Comfort&gt; When in the water, the rash guard tends to roll up, probably because the waist area is loose.
It swims while fixing the curled up parts.
If you&#39;re not careful, especially in the jacuzzi, your obese belly will be completely visible.
Also, if you walk while moving up and down vigorously, the bottom will tend to roll up.
&lt;Product construction&gt; The fabric is durable and not too thin, so you don&#39;t have to worry about your nipples showing through.
I&#39;m happy with the quality at this price, but I think it would fit better if I bought a smaller size.
I did have a gas leak though...
The silver Colt 25 was leaking gas as expected, and when I replaced the valve, there was an issue where part of the tank broke off, but I used Bass Bond Q to seal the tank and repair and grease it up, and it was firing fine again. If you want to buy this Colt 25, you should either be able to disassemble and assemble it yourself, or ask someone who can, and since you don&#39;t have to take digital camera pictures while disassembling it, I don&#39;t recommend it for people who aren&#39;t confident, but if you don&#39;t mind it breaking, it might be fun. I also bought another black Colt 25, and the trick to disassembling it is to hold the trigger with your left thumb while removing the left side, and I managed to disassemble it without any parts flying off. When reassembling, I applied silicone grease to the springs and small parts and assembled while fixing them with grease. To disassemble, first remove the grip, remove the screws of the safety, and then remove the two screws on the body on the left side, being careful not to scratch the end of the barrel, and remove the front sight and inner barrel with pliers without pinching them. After that, since it has a monaka structure, you can slowly remove the left side and it will come out. However, do so at your own risk and don&#39;t blame others if you fail.
I wondered what kind of quality it was for 188 yen.
It can be used when fast turning or when torque is required.
It&#39;s light, small, and best of all, simple and without any frills.
There&#39;s no rattle when you attach the bit, and I thought it was amazing value for money at 188 yen.
The only thing left to consider is durability.
You probably won&#39;t use it that often, but it&#39;s a good thing to have in your toolbox.
I purchased this together with the &quot;1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release driver knurled bit holder 60/100/150 mm&quot; from the same seller.
No issues here either, and it was pretty good for the price.
The controller stops working
Your aircraft starts moving on its own and you can no longer control it.
Once the cable is reconnected, the device can be operated, but after a few minutes the device will move in the wrong direction and become uncontrollable.
It is better not to buy this product.
I&#39;d like to warn everyone just in case.
This is a terrible product.
Although it is wired, we recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It&#39;s very reliable and hasn&#39;t broken down even after a long period of use.
It can also be used for PC games.
.... Addendum: I was able to return the defective item within a month and get a refund in the form of an Amazon gift certificate, so I think that was a good thing.
Will this improve my calculation skills?
I think it&#39;s suitable for kids who understand math.
I think it would be difficult unless the child has a certain level of understanding of calculation.
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when you want to give a tool to the boss, you have to slide your finger up on the screen, but I tried to do it myself, and no matter how many times I tried, it just didn&#39;t work smoothly.
In other words, it may be easier for people who are used to using the DS to slide.
I just can&#39;t seem to like the illustrations of manga characters. I suppose one of the reasons people get into DS games is because of the visual appeal, but for some reason I just can&#39;t relate to them.
The calculation method is also a time-based competition, for example, how many questions you can answer correctly in a certain number of minutes.
I understand the desire to rush students for exams etc, but won&#39;t they end up rushing them into doing calculations?
For some reason I don&#39;t like the gong that rings when it&#39;s over.
You&#39;re working hard, so why not make it sound more pleasing?
I feel like I wasted 6,200 yen on this.
I would understand if it was half the price.
Sorry, that&#39;s why I gave it 2 stars.
Persona&#39;s songs are great after all!
I made it to the ending of Persona 3.
I played part way through 5.
I have completed all the trophies for Persona 4 on my Vita.
What you can do hasn&#39;t changed from the previous game, Persona 4.
Since there&#39;s no story, it feels shorter than the previous film.
The song is really cool!
Just listening to it makes me feel good!
This was the first time the Persona 3 characters had been rendered in HD, so I was thrilled when I saw them for the first time.
Somehow Junpei looked handsome (lol). Persona 5 is beautiful to begin with, so there&#39;s nothing new about it... so when you think about it, 3 seems like a better deal.
As a rhythm game, I found 5 to be easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is primarily blue, but it was hard to see against a dark background.
5 mainly uses bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even when it overlaps with the background.
There are a lot of assist functions, so even people who aren&#39;t good at rhythm games should be able to play.
If you&#39;re an experienced rhythm game player, turning on the challenge function may make the game more challenging.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it&#39;s not just a bonus; it&#39;s a full four-disc set, so if you&#39;re a fan of Persona music, I recommend this one.
What a shame
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual product has a bluish tint but is closer to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn&#39;t a double buckle.
That&#39;s why I was thinking about buying gold, but I&#39;m putting it on hold for now. The price is low so maybe I can give in?
After posting the review, I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange the item for a new one.
The process after that was also quick.
Even though it was a cheap product, the service was very good.
4 stars for service. Addendum: I then purchased the gold as well.
The color is almost exactly as pictured and it&#39;s very beautiful.
However, the buckle is not a double lock, and it is clearly different from the instruction photo.
That&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s disappointing.
It gets very heavy in the evenings.
I used it on a SIM-free iPhone 7s.
When I first set it up, I didn&#39;t know what to do after I arrived in Korea and inserted the SIM card, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport and she showed me how (go to Settings &gt; Mobile &gt; Communication options and turn on data roaming), and it worked fine.
The instruction manual that came with the product didn&#39;t seem to be of much use...
However, the signal was poor around Gimpo Airport, so I was only able to get 3G the whole time.
Once I got into the city, I got 4G.
Sometimes the data traffic would become very slow in the evening or at night, and looking back, I may have reached the daily limit of several hundred MB.
Better than I expected
I had a Softbank Z4 for two years, then I made it SIM-free and started using Ymobile, but the Z4 started to malfunction so I was looking to buy a second-hand Xperia when I found this new phone that can be used with Saifu Keitai and bought it.
I was using Mobile Suica so I was worried whether it would work properly, but there were no problems at all.
The size, weight, and the silver color make it look like an iPhone 6 at first glance.
I don&#39;t play games, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, but it seems a little faster. In the reviews, it said that the fingerprint recognition is slow, but it seems to take a while to be recognized, so I use the face recognition, which is faster.
I thought it was amazing how it looked just like an iPhone. I&#39;ve also updated my Android to version 9, so I&#39;m very satisfied with this purchase.
Cons It would be better if it was a little smaller No strap hole *Can be used with a case that has a strap hole Water resistance has not been tested It&#39;s a little heavy I&#39;ve only used it a little, but I&#39;m happy with it I recommend it
