When I tried to purchase the entry package, a blue and orange package came out.
The orange one costs more than twice as much.
What&#39;s the difference?
Please let me know because I couldn&#39;t find it even after searching.
Right now, the only one available is blue.
If so, it may just be an old product left.
Both are the same, just different in appearance.
Karate vs Jiu Jitsu
Who is stronger if they fight with the same height and weight?
Jiu-jitsu
In general, karate only involves practicing fighting karate against each other.
Jiu-jitsu, especially Brazilian jiu-jitsu, involves training that includes dealing with blows.

Was the Destiny Plan in ``Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny&#39;&#39; the result of Durandal being dumped by Talia?
Because of the genetic mismatch, he and Talia broke up because they couldn&#39;t have children, so are the genes really that good?

I don&#39;t feel like watching TV anymore because of things like that...
Does that mean it&#39;s no longer possible to be an entertainer? TV is full of comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there were quite a few scenes where the staff would laugh in the background even when they were saying something that wasn&#39;t particularly funny.
It&#39;s obviously not funny, but the way he laughs and says, ``I&#39;m a popular comedian, so I have to laugh at everything he says&#39;&#39; is creepy.
But if the staff doesn&#39;t laugh, the entertainer will be in a bad mood, which will probably be bad for work relationships.
Like the old black companies, that industry is very athletic, and it seems like some of the comedians have such big egos that they behave in a generally unpleasant manner, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be able to make a living. .
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who are trying to emphasize how difficult their job is and saying, ``Don&#39;t criticize comedians.&#39;&#39;
I know that my income is pretty low until I start selling, but I&#39;m constantly told that being a comedian is like being at the top of a difficult profession.
It just sounds like a glorification of his own career and a justification for the high position of comedians in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in has some tough parts, but I feel like it&#39;s becoming more and more impossible to get into the entertainment world.
I&#39;m sorry for complaining.
I felt like if I didn&#39;t let it out like a fart, it wouldn&#39;t be good for my body...

The product I ordered at Tsukumo Net Shop was replaced without my permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheap wireless mouse, received a wired version of the mouse, and was told to return it if I wanted a refund.
This is more of a mail-order issue than a topic about home-built PCs, but no matter how I look at it, I&#39;m not convinced, and since it&#39;s a famous place, I&#39;ll write about it here.
It all started when I discovered an MSI wireless gaming mouse on sale for 3,280 yen (link to Uotaku) during the Tsukumo Online Shop&#39;s Tsukumo Day Sale that started last Friday.
At the store, the wired version had the same price, so I checked the wired version page to take into account the possibility of a price mistake, and the price was 5,071 yen (linked to Uotaku), so I ordered it thinking it might not be a mistake.
I successfully received the order email and also received the shipping email the next day.
The name &quot;CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS&quot; was written in these two emails and in the purchase history on my page.
At this point, I thought I would receive the wireless mouse I ordered because there was no notification of a mistake or cancellation between the time I placed the order and the time it was shipped.
This is where the problem started. A few hours after shipping, I received an email stating that there was a mistake in product registration.
According to that email
* The wireless version was sold at a special price, but it was actually the wired version.
*We have already shipped wired mice, so
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all items
2. Return only the mouse for a refund
3. Just use a wired mouse
Choose your response
The product pages for the wired and wireless versions are separate, and even though the purchase history, email, and delivery note say it&#39;s the wireless version, it seems like they replaced it with the wired version without permission.
Isn&#39;t it terrible that you were sent a different product to the one you bought without your consent and if you want a refund, you should just send it back?
Even if I ultimately accept a refund, I would like to fight back somehow, so please lend me your wisdom.
If you are looking for marriage or a partner, do you think you don&#39;t want to date someone who doesn&#39;t have a good relationship with your family?
Or does it not matter?
If you care, why?
For example, people who have severed ties with their parents or siblings.
I don&#39;t really care
The reason we don&#39;t get along is because both our parents and siblings have different personalities and some are unreasonable.

Isolated twice...Typhoon and heavy rain wash away the only bridge connecting the area Residents triple their food stockpiles &lt;Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture&gt; (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Yoshiro Matsumoto from the Takachihara area of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: ``At first, you&#39;re like, ``Are you serious?&#39;&#39;
I felt like it was going to break so quickly, that I was going to be washed away.&#39;&#39; The only road leading to the Takachihara area, the Takachihara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 30 residents from 11 households stranded in the area. Ta.
Residents who were forced to cut off their water supply continued to have to use JR railway bridges, which are normally closed to traffic, to transport necessary supplies.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: ``Normally, I can drive to the garden by car, but I have to get out of the car over there and carry it in my hand or carry it on my back and walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I am grateful for the means of transportation and the car. A makeshift bridge was completed a month later, but less than three months later it was washed away by heavy rains, leaving the area stranded again for several days until a temporary bridge was installed.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has made progress, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: ``I think there are about 10 cases.
For now, I&#39;d like to make sure I have enough food for two to three days.&#39;&#39; I made sure to stock up on three times as many foods that can be used as emergency rations, such as canned goods and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: ``You never know when a disaster will befall you, not someone else, so I realized once again that it would be better for everyone to stock up a little.&#39;&#39; On the other hand, a bridge was washed away. Yamatsuri Town experienced an unexpected disaster.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town began its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Director of Education Division, Yamatsuri Town: ``We have announced that we would like to designate it as ``Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day&#39;&#39; and make October 12th the day to think about disaster prevention preparations from next year onwards.
I think people are becoming more aware of the possibility of unexpected things happening than ever before.

I remember there being a group like that, so there seems to be some sort of group like that.

Be careful when purchasing a used home!
What are the pitfalls of the &quot;building condition inspection system&quot; (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
● Newly established &quot;building condition survey&quot; system to revitalize the used housing market Transactions on used housing are doing well.
Prices for both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own a home increases due to the coronavirus pandemic, the popularity of properties represented by words such as ``in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station&#39;&#39;, ``large-scale&#39;&#39;, and ``tower&#39;&#39; is becoming more popular, and the number of relatively inexpensive newly built properties has decreased sharply. would also be influenced.
[View images from this article] However, compared to other countries, the market share of existing (used) housing in Japan still remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially amended the Real Estate Transaction Business Act and started conducting building condition surveys, so-called inspections, for the purpose of safe and secure transactions of used housing (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf ).
This is a system in which an architect who is familiar with housing checks the current state of the property and the condition of the building, including deterioration, compiles a report, and presents it to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections has benefits for both buyers and sellers.
By inspecting the property before the purchase transaction, sellers can avoid complaints after delivery, and give buyers peace of mind.
This will also lead to differentiation among competing properties.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the used home they are planning to purchase and makes the purchase with confidence.
However, under the current system, it is primarily the seller who has the initiative to investigate the condition of the building.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system has become obligatory.
In other words, real estate business operators in charge of brokering a property are obligated to explain that ``we can introduce an architect who will conduct a building condition survey when brokering a property,&#39;&#39; or ``we cannot.&#39;&#39; However, they are not obligated to do so. It turns out.
● Concerned risks with seller-led inspections On the other hand, looking overseas, similar systems are already in place in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, which have thriving second-hand markets.
In this system, before buying or selling a home, a buyer requests a building inspection from a specialist called an ``inspector&#39;&#39; or ``building surveyor.&#39;&#39;
For example, in the United States, inspections are conducted in 70 to 90% of used home transactions, depending on the state.
In that the inspection is carried out under the leadership of the &quot;buyer,&quot; its nature is very different from the Japanese-style inspection, which is mainly conducted by the &quot;seller.&quot;
Sellers try to make the building&#39;s condition look as good as possible and sell it as quickly and as high as possible.
Buyers, on the other hand, want to carefully examine the details of the inspection, make appropriate repairs, and live in the property with peace of mind.
Even though the inspection is the same, there is a discrepancy in the objectives and thoughts of both parties.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks concerning the Japanese system.
● The scope of state-mandated, seller-initiated inspections is minimal.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking truly important defects. ●For inspection companies, the intermediary company (seller) who introduces the case they are responsible for can be considered a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection will be carried out in a ``reckless&#39;&#39; manner, such as not reporting unfavorable inspection results to the seller.

It was pretty tough.
However, since I had recovered mentally (?), I was full of motivation.
My body wasn&#39;t able to keep up, and since I was working as a researcher, I would fall asleep during work.
Since it was my second time in a year, I thought lightly that I would take a month off and say goodbye to this crappy company, but it turned out to be more serious than I expected and the medication didn&#39;t work for me, so it dragged on for a long time.
In any case, it&#39;s important to go to a psychiatrist and get proper treatment, and to keep a record of your hospital visits (super important).
As long as you have a history of going to the hospital, even if you quit your job due to personal reasons, you can change it to a resignation due to company reasons at the doctor&#39;s discretion, which greatly lowers the hurdles for receiving unemployment insurance etc.
Even if you can&#39;t find a job or want to take some time off, you can have peace of mind and pockets.

Was Ginza an island?
5 Trivia you can talk about while wearing a silver bra (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
``This place used to be a peninsula.
As proof of that...&#39;&#39;, it is unique to Ginza that you can show off a little trivia.
We&#39;ll introduce some trivia about Ginza that you&#39;ll find interesting and want to tell someone about.
Going above Ginza!?
First infiltration into Kinza
As you walk through Ginza, you can see traces of the history that Ginza has carved out everywhere, such as quirky place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
As I was walking with my girlfriend in Ginza, there was a sudden silence and I said, ``This place used to be a peninsula.
Was Ginza once a peninsula?
&quot;Ginza&quot; in Chuo Ward, Tokyo is synonymous with the downtown area that gave birth to &quot;○○ Ginza&quot; all over Japan.
To begin with, &quot;Ginza&quot; refers to a silver coin mint, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza government office, which was located in present-day Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
At the time, it was called ``Shinryogaecho,&#39;&#39; but after it was moved to Kakigaracho, it became known as ``Ginza.&#39;&#39;
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza was once a &quot;peninsula&quot; that jutted out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, an inlet ran into the area from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called Edomae Island stretched from Nihonbashi to Ginza.
The tip of that peninsula corresponds to present-day Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the bay and improved the Kyobashi area.
Furthermore, Ieyasu developed the city blocks and built moats around them in order to develop shipping.
The inlet was then reclaimed by cutting down the soil from the moat and Kandayama.
In front of the Tiffany Ginza main store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument that says ``Birthplace of Ginza&#39;&#39; marking the site of the former Ginza government office, so if you are interested, why not look for it?
Ginza&#39;s &quot;sacred place pilgrimage&quot; known only to those in the know
In Ginza, a &quot;sacred place pilgrimage&quot; known only to those in the know, called the &quot;Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour,&quot; is held every year.
Of the more than 10 sacred sites, the most easily visible is Kabuki Inari Shrine, located in front of Kabukiza.
Many people visit the shrine, which stands on the far right of Kabukiza, before and after watching a play.
On the other hand, ``Ryukou Fudoson&#39;&#39; is located on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and ``Ginza Shusse Jizoson&#39;&#39; is located on the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
``Hodo Inari Shrine,&#39;&#39; ``Azuma Inari Shrine,&#39;&#39; and ``Toyoiwa Inari Shrine&#39;&#39; are located at the back of an alley and are hard to see, but ``Toyoiwa Inari Shrine&#39;&#39; was revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon. The well-known ``Shinjutsu Inari Shrine&#39;&#39; located at the 1st floor entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
This shrine tour includes places that enshrine Fudo Myoo and Jizo Bosatsu, but most of the shrines enshrine Inari as the deity.
Inari shrines, where a fox greets you in front of the main shrine building, were built in areas where there were many farmers, as they were said to bring good luck in ``rich harvests,&#39;&#39; as rice grows well.
As a result, in large cities like Kyoto and Edo, it was said that it would bring good fortune for business, and the belief spread even in Ginza, Japan&#39;s busiest shopping district.
What do you think about people who return home without getting vaccinated?
It&#39;s probably not good.
There have been many cases of infection with the Omicron strain even after being vaccinated twice.
I have to say that it was a thoughtless act.

Man&#39;s body found in Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya (Chukyo TV NEWS) - Yahoo! News
Just before noon on the 12th, a man was found dead, lying face down in the Shonai River in Moriyama Ward, Nagoya City.
Police are investigating the man&#39;s identity and cause of death.
According to the police, just before 11:30 a.m. on the 12th, a passerby spotted a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashidanmi, Moriyama Ward, and called 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police are working to confirm the identity and investigate the cause of death.
Meanwhile, in Sunagawa in Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river and was confirmed dead.
The man&#39;s clothes were not disheveled, but his bicycle was found lying nearby.
Police are working to confirm his identity and are investigating the circumstances at the time.
Benefits will be paid to households exempt from resident tax in mid-February, but will they be paid if one person in the household is exempt from tax?
It looks like confirmation documents will be sent from today...

South Korea&#39;s POSCO International acquires Australia&#39;s Cenex Energy to expand overseas gas field business = South Korean report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International announced on the 12th that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the shares of Australia&#39;s Senex Energy, and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, procedures such as approval at Cenex Energy&#39;s general meeting of shareholders and approval of the local subsidiary remain to be completed, and the acquisition process is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
This acquisition is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&amp;A) since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total acquisition price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International will invest 50.1% and Hancock Energy will invest 49.9%.
POSCO International explained that it decided on this acquisition because it believes that demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the era of energy transition, and that natural gas-based blue hydrogen will split the market into two, along with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, POSCO International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea&#39;s natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as human resources to operate onshore gas fields in Australia. Become.

Could that knee pain be caused by knee osteoarthritis?
Different treatments depending on the cause (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editorial Department: Recently, I have been having constant pain in my knee.
What kind of disease might it be?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, including injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among these, osteoarthritis is the most common in Japanese people.
Editorial Department: Does this mean that the joints become deformed?
Professor Maruyama: That&#39;s right.
Originally, the surfaces of joints are covered with cartilage, which functions to cushion shock and smooth the movement of joints.
However, due to aging, obesity, and strenuous sports, the cartilage can become worn down or distorted.
This results in joint deformity and inflammation.
Editorial Department: Does osteoarthritis occur in areas other than the knees?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knees, it can also occur in the joints and bases of the fingers, neck, lower back, big toes, and hip joints.
However, the most common type of osteoarthritis occurs in the knees, and is called ``knee osteoarthritis.&#39;&#39;
Editorial Department: First of all, what kind of structure is a joint?
Dr. Maruyama: A joint is made up of two bones that fit together in an uneven manner.
The part where these two bones face each other is covered with &quot;articular cartilage,&quot; and the area around the joint is wrapped in a &quot;joint capsule.&quot;
Editorial Department: It has a complicated structure.
Mr. Maruyama: That&#39;s right.
The lining of the joint capsule contains a tissue called the synovium, which produces joint fluid.
This synovial fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing the movements of the knees.
Editorial Department: What symptoms occur when you develop osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from coming into direct contact.
In other words, it acts like a cushion.
However, if this becomes worn or distorted, it can deform the joint or cause inflammation, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?
I usually wear pajamas, but when my pajamas are being washed, I put on my jersey and sleep!
Even if you are a heavy smoker, are some people able to quit smoking and others not?
Well, there are two types.
A friend of mine used to be a heavy drinker, but he stopped drinking completely.
He said he thought he should give it a try, so he just gave up.

3 gambling and games from the Kaiji series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The ``Kaiji&#39;&#39; gambling manga series is explosively popular, especially among men.
One of the best parts of this game is the ultimate game where you put your life on the line.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes me lose my footing... ... Try crossing the steel frame!
So this time, I would like to examine the Kaiji games that you can actually play or that are practiced in planned videos.
■Numa This is the trap-filled pachinko &quot;Numa&quot; that appeared in &quot;Gambaku Hakairoku Kaiji&quot;.
In the original work, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This ``swamp&#39;&#39; was set with large traps such as a ``forest of nails,&#39;&#39; ``movable objects,&#39;&#39; and a ``3-stage croon,&#39;&#39; making it almost impossible to capture.
However, Kaiji used every trick he could, and in the end, he successfully conquered the building by placing a vinyl water tank on top of the building to make the ground sink and tilt.
The ``Numa&#39;&#39; that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko machine, and many people play it.
Of course, it&#39;s not ``4,000 yen per ball&#39;&#39; and the difficulty level has been lowered, but you can still enjoy the feeling of being a Kaiji.
■Steel-frame crossing The ``Human Horse Racing&#39;&#39; steel-frame crossing was performed by the debtors, including Kaiji, at the ``Starside Party&#39;&#39; held by rich people as entertainment.
Debtors compete to see how fast they can move while trying not to fall on a thin steel frame set 10 meters above the ground.
Twelve people participate, and the top two win prizes, but there are only four steel beams, safety measures are inadequate, and the chance of death is quite high.
This steel frame crossing is highly dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, it is also possible to experience a very similar experience at &quot;Eagle Bridge&quot; installed at &quot;Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi&quot;, the home base of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. can.
Eagle Bridge has a single steel bridge that stands out at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of a building), and beyond that is a ``sky swing&#39;&#39; and a ``victory bridge&#39;&#39; that you can walk to.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi posted a video of himself walking across Eagle Bridge on his YouTube page, saying, ``You can experience steel bridge crossing in Japan,&#39;&#39; which became a hot topic.
■E-Card “E-Card” is a two-player card game.
A total of 10 cards are used: 1 emperor card, 8 citizen cards, and 1 slave card, and the game is played divided into the emperor&#39;s side and the slave&#39;s side.
This game is very well made, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against citizens, the citizens are strong against slaves, and the slaves are strong against the emperor.
In the play, Kaiji competes against Tonegawa under the strict rule that if he loses, his ear will be cut off.
Kaiji struggles hard, but in the end, he realizes that the earphone-like device that destroys his ears is reading his psychology by detecting and transmitting changes in his pulse and body temperature. By reducing his body to an abnormal value, he confused Tonegawa and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of himself competing with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, using E-cards, and it became a hot topic.
■Would you like to experience what Kaiji feels like?
No one wants to be in Kaiji&#39;s situation, but it&#39;s also true that reading the manga will help you get a feel for it.
Why not get a feel for that worldview through the game?
A gentle support for the first step towards the new year: a large tiger votive plaque at the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
At Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema depicting next year&#39;s zodiac sign, ``Tora,&#39;&#39; has appeared.
Tohoku University of Art and Design students who designed the design visited the shrine on the 11th, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
Since the year before last, the shrine has commissioned art students to draw the original illustrations for the votive tablets.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was selected from among the nine students in the art department&#39;s Japanese painting course taught by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters high at the center.
Mr. Tsuchiya said he drew it with the image of ``the cherry blossoms gently pushing against your back as you step into the new year.&#39;&#39;
The image of the tiger standing still and looking at the cherry blossoms symbolizes the hope that ``even in a rapidly changing world, we can still have the time to admire the beauty of nature.&#39;&#39;
Tsuchiya&#39;s designs are also depicted on votive tablets that are distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, ``I think it will help all people overcome difficulties.&#39;&#39;

Let&#39;s think about &quot;Tamano that we want to continue living in&quot; - Workshop for 4 high school students in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San-Digi
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are jointly holding a workshop to think about the ``Tamano they want to continue living in.&#39;&#39;
As part of the research and policy recommendation project of the intermediary support organization Tamano SDGs Future Creation Center, we will compile the voices of young people and make recommendations to the mayor and others.
&quot;When do you have fun?&quot;
In response to the facilitator&#39;s questions, students respond by saying things like ``When I&#39;m having fun with a lot of people&#39;&#39; and ``When I&#39;m playing the drums.&#39;&#39;
The first event was held on November 13th at Hinode Fureai Hall.
Using the ``World Café&#39;&#39; method, 18 high school students and local residents discussed ``an interesting town,&#39;&#39; ``a town that is easy to live in,&#39;&#39; and ``a town that feels worth living in&#39;&#39; as they moved around islands with different themes. .
Write down each idea on a sticky note and paste it on a piece of paper to organize it.
``A town with a lot of young people looks interesting.&#39;&#39; ``Transportation such as trains and buses is essential for a comfortable place to live.&#39;&#39;
Let&#39;s discuss further to see if we have anything in common.
``I thought Tamano was boring, but being able to cycle along the seaside is appealing,&#39;&#39; said an 18-year-old Tamano Shoko High School third-year student.
A third-year student at Binan High School (18) said, ``There aren&#39;t many shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it&#39;s a nice place with lots of nature,&#39;&#39; and by talking with adults, he seemed to have noticed not only the challenges of the area, but also its charms. .
At the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the content of their recommendations.
They plan to invite the mayor, superintendent of education, and others to make an announcement in February next year.
Rie Higashi, the center&#39;s director, said, ``We hope to foster a love of the local area among high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to become proactively involved in community development.&#39;&#39;

How to find a new way to wrap a stole (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
A stole is essential for winter, but do you sometimes find that the fabric feels loose around your neck?
It&#39;s a good idea to look in the mirror and adjust your balance after wrapping, but I&#39;ve heard people say they don&#39;t really know the trick.
I was wondering if there was a stole that could be rolled up quickly without causing the fabric to sag, and I found something innovative.
The stoles from the brand ``COTTORI&#39;&#39; are approximately 1 meter long on the long side, making them more compact than regular ones.
When I first saw it, I thought, ``Is it possible to wrap it so short?&#39;&#39;
If you look closely, you will see that the cloth is cut into long strips and woven into a single piece, giving it a net-like appearance.
The ends of the stole can be passed through the mesh.
Therefore, you can wrap it and secure it without tying the ends together.
The fleece material is very light and warm.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular as jackets, but many people will be wearing them in combination with a stole to keep their shoulders from getting cold.
I think having a stall like this would definitely come in handy.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney+ is super interesting
It&#39;s called Get Buck, directed by Peter Jackson.
It&#39;s so vivid, it feels like a life-sized version of the Beatles, and it&#39;s refreshing in a lot of ways...
It&#39;s right before the breakup, so there&#39;s some squeaks, but it&#39;s not the dramatic squeaks I had imagined.
There was Paul who was doing his best to manage things but was annoying and said, ``I know I&#39;m annoying, but come on!&#39;&#39; and George who was a bit lazy and said, ``But...&#39;&#39;, and even though he was calmly expressing his opinions and joking, he was still late. John seems unmotivated...Ringo, who plays the soothing role, doesn&#39;t actively intervene and sits in the back with a look on his face like, ``I&#39;m in trouble.&#39;&#39;
We didn&#39;t really hate each other to the point of fighting, but there was a certain atmosphere of, ``Well, we can&#39;t work together anymore,&#39;&#39; and I think the Beatles were like that too. It&#39;s interesting, I guess you could call it the dismantling of a legend.
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance started, everyone was really talented.
The process of starting from a simple phrase and asking each other, ``What do you think about this?&#39;&#39; and then turning it into ``that masterpiece&#39;&#39; is amazing.
Especially the moment when the title “Get Buck” is completed is amazing.
It&#39;s amazing how the scene where the casual humming like hun hun hun gradually becomes that zucha ♪ zucha ♪ and the lyrics are recorded is well recorded.
It&#39;s amazing because you don&#39;t often get to see the process of composing like this.
Also, it goes without saying, but everyone is doing their best, so just watching the performance makes me happy.
It seems like it&#39;s only episode 1 of 3, but so far I have the impression that the biggest reason for the disbandment was not the Beatles themselves but the environment around them.
The four of us are complaining about something, but once we start writing the song, it looks like it&#39;s going to be fun, but where should we do the live performance? When it came to this topic, I realized that producers and publicity people were saying things like ``The Beatles are the best in the world after all!&#39;&#39; and that things were already out of their hands. It was easy
Well, documentaries also involve the director&#39;s interpretation, so Peter Jackson&#39;s feelings may have come out...
Also, it seems that Paul is supervising it, so I thought that might be the reason why there are so many scenes where Paul seems to be the bad guy.

Frequent tornadoes in the United States cause major damage due to unseasonably warm weather and strong cold (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of the 10th (Friday) to the 11th (Saturday) local time, many tornadoes occurred mainly in the southern United States.
It is believed that the atmospheric conditions became extremely unstable due to the strong cold air moving south in an area that was record-breakingly warm for this time of year, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed.
Warm air flowed into the southern United States from the southwest, causing record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on the 9th (Thursday) and 10th (Friday) local time rose to nearly 30 degrees Celsius.
In this record-breaking warm area, strong cold air of -30℃ or less moved southward at around 5,500m above the ground, causing an active front to form due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly forming along the front. Developed to.
It appears that tornadoes occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
The southern United States is naturally prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage occurring during this period.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in one day during the winter season, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received over 400 reports of tornadoes and gusty winds on Friday the 10th (local time) alone.
According to this, it can be seen that there are two main areas of concentration: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the tornado reached EF3, the third strongest of six tornadoes on the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of tornadoes, and it is thought that wind gusts of around 70 m/s were blown momentarily.
Depending on future investigations, it may be determined to be EF4-5.
In Japan, JEF (Japanese Improved Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Improved Fujita Scale and adapted to the situation of Japanese buildings.
There is a good chance that a JEF3 tornado, equivalent to the current American tornado, will occur in Japan, and it is strong enough to cause wooden houses to collapse.

Live broadcast calls for help from beneath the rubble of US tornado ``largest in history&#39;&#39; (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding the tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, US President Biden expressed his opinion on the 11th (12th Japan time) with a grim expression, calling it ``one of the worst tornadoes in the history of the United States.&#39;&#39;
This was reported by CNN TV and others.
Biden emphasized that the federal government will do everything possible.
``We still don&#39;t know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost.&#39;&#39;
The death toll is feared to exceed 100.
[Photo] Residents carry household belongings from damaged homes in Kentucky, which was hit by tornadoes From the night of the 10th to the early hours of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes struck in at least six states, including Kentucky.
The record of tornado damage is 219 miles (approximately 350 km), which was reported in 1925 when it caused damage in Missouri and other states, but CNN weather experts estimate that the tornado&#39;s damage range was approximately 250 miles (approximately 400 km) this time. It was estimated that it was the largest such event.
In the hard-hit Mayfield, Kentucky, candle factory, which had been operating around the clock in preparation for the Christmas shopping season, was also severely damaged.
There were 110 people working there at the time, but the building was destroyed and no trace left.
A woman trapped under 1.5 meters of rubble in the dark felt the weight of rescuers searching the rubble and called for help via a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone. Ta.
In addition to the woman&#39;s screams for help, the live broadcast also included screams and the sound of another woman singing ``Happy Birthday to You,&#39;&#39; which appeared to be a tearful song to drown out her fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, hid with her 5-year-old son in the basement of her home after a tornado warning was issued.
``Many people liken it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a rumbling sound, like something erupting from the ground,&#39;&#39; he recalled.
A Mayfield police officer said: ``Search operations will continue until they are no longer necessary.&#39;&#39;
&quot;I don&#39;t know if it will be weeks, months, or years,&quot; he said, continuing the rescue efforts.
At least six people were confirmed dead in Illinois after a portion of an Amazon warehouse collapsed.
Trains have been derailed due to the force of the impact, and expressways have been closed one after another due to the impact of overturning cars.
According to US web media, about 400,000 homes are without power, including 130,000 in Tennessee.

It has been said for a long time that there are different ways of thinking about the star rating system.
The argument is that while other countries use 5 stars as the standard and subtract points from there, Japan considers 3 stars as neutral and adds/deducts points.
There is already a difference of two stars at the point of reference, and four stars have completely different meanings between ``there are elements that deduct points&#39;&#39; and ``not a masterpiece, but an honorable mention.&#39;&#39;
If we use 5 stars as the standard, ``works that have no flaws&#39;&#39; and ``works that are of the highest standard in all aspects&#39;&#39; will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, then the system does not present the meaning of stars. I think it&#39;s a flaw in the above, but since that kind of system is actually being used that way, I&#39;m asking you not to give it 3 stars (bad reviews).
Therefore, if you try to refute those who advocate this type of argument with Steam&#39;s two-choice evaluation, the discussion will not go well.

Is there a submersible pump that can be powered by USB and can be plugged into a common hose size?
The power capacity that can be obtained from a USB is approximately 2A at 5V, which is 10W at most.
Submersible pumps consume at least 500W, depending on the item, so it&#39;s definitely not possible.

Homemade radio volume
I made an AM radio using a homemade condenser and coil, but there was so much noise that I couldn&#39;t hear it clearly.
I could hear the radio, but it was on a different frequency than the one I was tuned to.
It&#39;s possible that the tuning was too loose and I couldn&#39;t hear it clearly, but it wasn&#39;t the station I expected.
Now to get to the point, I thought I made an AM radio, but it looks like I can hear an FM radio.
Why do you think so? Is there such a thing?
Can I delete Esp from SMIM or Dlizzio&#39;s Mesh Fixes?

I&#39;m not planning on actually doing it because I understand the risks, but I&#39;m worried about it and can only sleep at night.
I would like to know if it is technically possible.
If anyone remembers it, please let me know if it&#39;s ok to do it.

&lt;A diary of eating Saga&gt; &quot;Hakobune&quot;&#39;s &quot;Fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce&quot; | Lifestyle and Culture | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Lunch box &quot;Fried seasonal fish and shrimp caught in the nearby sea, homemade tartar sauce&quot;
``hakobune&#39;&#39; is a take-out specialty store that serves colorful bento boxes and deli dishes made with plenty of vegetables.
Takayuki Kazuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened the restaurant in August last year with the aim of ``giving people the feeling of being in a restaurant at home.&#39;&#39;
One of the popular bento menu items is ``Fried seasonal fish and shrimp caught in the nearby sea, homemade tartar sauce&#39;&#39; (1000 yen).
Choose the best fish at the market at the time.
``For the fried shrimp, we use raw breadcrumbs as lightly as possible so that you can feel the texture of the ingredients,&#39;&#39; says Takayuki, and the plump texture of the fried shrimp is directly noticeable.
The bento comes with garnished vegetables, about four kinds of deli items, rice made from Hinohikari grown in Saga prefecture, mixed grains, and soup.
Vegetables are grown locally in the soba fields or purchased from direct sales stores within the prefecture.
The side dishes vary depending on the season, but Mr. Takayuki has extensive French training, and dishes such as rapais and ratatouille add color.
On the other hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western dishes that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations, with ``a comforting taste that you are used to eating&#39;&#39; (Yumi says), such as dashimaki tamago.
The bento box &quot;Hand-kneaded hamburger steak made with domestically produced pork&quot; (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, they will also be selling ``charcuterie sets,&#39;&#39; processed meat products that go well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to stop by Haneda Airport and there was something that looked interesting so I tried it out.
Ride comfort: Not that bad, but sometimes shakes (not enough to make you feel drunk)
Speed: Of course slow
Safety: I slowed down when there were people around, and in some cases stopped completely, so I thought it was safe, but I thought it could be dangerous depending on the location.
It hurts when people look at me. It&#39;s good to be looked at, but it hurts when people look at me and say, ``I&#39;m getting in the way.&#39;&#39;
Overall review: It wasn&#39;t bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It&#39;s a shame that it would be easier to use if there were fewer people or if they were asked to sit closer to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be a good idea to create a dedicated lane so that it doesn&#39;t get in the way of other people walking.
However, I thought it would be a good ride if there were fewer people because it was relaxing and you could take your time while looking at the scenery.
It was a ride that would be difficult to ride unless you have a very patient mind, with the excitement of the near future of wondering if this kind of self-driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the gaze of those around you.
Damn it was embarrassing

If you look closely, you might be able to tell a little bit about it, but it doesn&#39;t contain any eel at all.
Actually, it&#39;s &quot;!Eggplant!&quot; (Tap and the correct answer will appear)
I love eel, but in reality, everyone just eats it with sauce, and I thought that the eel part could be anything other than the doneness...I realized that the texture and volume of the eel is really important.
I don&#39;t want eel to go extinct, but I just wanted to eat it.
Recipe used: EGGPLANT “UNAGI” - Woks of Life (I added Japanese pepper instead of green onions.

A man was slashed and fled on a motorcycle. Attempted murder in Ozai, Saga City on the 12th | Incidents and Accidents | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a knife by a man who appeared to be in his 30s or 40s on a street in Ozai 1-chome, Saga City, sustaining injuries to his face.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and Saga Minami Police Station is searching for his whereabouts as a case of attempted murder.

A family&#39;s long journey to establish environmental protection activities in China&#39;s remote areas (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Corporate consultant for Find Asia, a Hong Kong company) China is a vast country and is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world&#39;s largest number of mammal species and the third largest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity, and in addition to environmental protection carried out by local governments, some regions promote the activities of environmental activists.
Xisapanna, Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is one such area.
Her younger sister, Ms. Lee, is currently active as an actress. Sisapanna is an area that borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the &quot;Tai&quot; people, who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand. This is the area where
This is the source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries.
Xisapanna Tai (Xishuangbanna) Autonomous Prefecture Although the area of Xisapanna is only about 0.2% of China&#39;s total area, it is home to about 25% of the wildlife species and 20% of the plant species.
This time, we met Mr. Li Moguo, who is involved in environmental protection activities in Xisapanna, and talked about the details of his activities.
■ Started environmental protection activities with my German husband - - It&#39;s been 20 years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the impetus for this?
Mr. Lee: Our environmental protection activity, ``Tianzhou&#39;&#39;, began in 2000.
It all started with my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint science project between the United Nations and China.
This is the only tropical rainforest area in China and boasts some of the highest biodiversity.
However, at the same time, economic development lagged behind.
As a result, large-scale deforestation of tropical rainforests took place in order to establish industry in this region and to produce rubber, which was in short supply within China.
My husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and research biological resources.
I met him while I was working as a reporter there, and we got married.
― ― Did you have any interest in nature conservation before that?
Mr. Lee: I am from Sisapanna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without having that knowledge.
I sometimes see people who have an aura even though they don&#39;t have a good-looking face or are particularly tall. Why do you think that is?
A popular actor said this.
Aura is not something that comes out when you think about it.
It&#39;s something that comes naturally the moment you gain confidence in yourself. and.
That person must have a strong inner self-confidence.

I&#39;m just wondering, is it a small thing to compliment someone&#39;s outfit or say the color is nice?
It&#39;s not detailed, right?
I can see it though.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s detailed.
I&#39;ve never been praised for being so detailed, so I don&#39;t really know what they mean.
I guess it was a detailed compliment.

[Omakan/Personal Memo] Something that caused CTD in the MOD&#39;s own environment and took about a month and a half to identify.
The data was stable until March, but from around Golden Week I didn&#39;t have much time to play, and CTD was occurring due to multiple factors, and it took a very long time to identify it when I looked into it little by little, mainly on holidays.
Why didn&#39;t you use .Net Script Framework to analyze the logs (you could figure it out in a few minutes)? Some errors related to .dll series and meshes are not recorded in the crash log.
〇Main CTD timing
* No footprints are left in the logs of Papyrus, .Net Script Framework, and .dll plug-ins that leave logs.
* When killing some NPCs/accumulating attacks: Activates even on console kill → Improved with Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/powerofthree SE update restart version) OFF *Is there a possibility that this is a false accusation?
* Basic improvement by turning off the kill move setting from the PC via .ini when using camera work to activate a kill move against some NPCs: Setting conflict related to DAR + Nemesis? However, the number of DAR animations has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic outdoor) While moving in the field + some magic (e.g. freezing rune) activated, when hitting an NPC: Dirt &amp; Blood v 2.0 SPID use NPC application setting (top right of MCM) All improved after 5 consecutive trials with all OFF .
Is this due to additional armor worn by some actors/NPCs or a shader setting error for the body mesh? Although the 2.0 SPID usage default .ini has a formatting error, the result is the intended result and the prerequisite Perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking the motion/battle MODs (.dll ones) related to body part attacks and OnHit with false accusations, but the results looked like this.
I don&#39;t think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German, and French levels.
I decided to post this as I thought it might be helpful as a memorandum if there is someone who has a similar CTD problem in a Japanese environment.
Everyone is doing it on the edge of their mental state,
People around you don&#39;t notice it, not even your co-workers or even your family.
When I look around me, I sometimes feel optimistic and think that even though that person seems to be having a difficult time, he or she is working well and energetically.
However, he was probably just on the edge of his mental health.
I didn&#39;t retire in the name of mental illness, but I think I was at my limit right before I retired.
Thoughts on the importance of visiting psychiatric nursing - After today&#39;s visiting nursing
I suffer from bipolar disorder, so I have been receiving home-visit nursing for a long time, and I have known the nurse (female) at the visiting nursing station that I currently use for a long time, and we have a very good relationship. I think we are building.
We talk about different things every week.
Of course, they do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging them into one package), but most of all, I realized through today&#39;s home-visit nursing how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illnesses. I did.
Today we had a chat about the gender differences between men and women, and we even had a discussion about gender theory lol.
Is it okay for a visiting nurse to talk about sexual desires between men and women, or why her girlfriend got divorced? I also talk about things like this.
Occasionally, I&#39;ll be dressed as a woman.
However, in the case of a visiting nursing station operated by a psychiatric hospital, an old lady nurse who is no longer able to work in the ward comes and only provides administrative support, or an occupational therapist comes for visiting nursing, but she says, ``Here? I once heard from an acquaintance that he gives instructions from above, saying things like, ``I&#39;m in the medical field.&#39;&#39;
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think the nurses there are really good and treat me frankly and as an equal with my mental illness.
By the way, she&#39;s beautiful lol.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing care, and some may be considering receiving it.
Visiting nursing is very helpful for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves, please take it.
Then choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I ended up canceling my contract with a company because I just couldn&#39;t get it right.
Sorry for the lame sentences.
I know it&#39;s a false warning, but it freaked me out when it came out in English.

・The person who created it does not know how it is displayed in Japanese.
・Language detection problem

South Korea&#39;s hydrogen technology patent is one-fifth that of China... &quot;Delay in implementation of hydrogen economy roadmap&quot; (JoongAng Ilbo Japanese version) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a hydrogen economy roadmap.
The plan was to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in use (cumulatively) by 2022 and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target (approximately 17,000 units).
The spread of hydrogen stations, a core infrastructure, has reached 38% of the target (approximately 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is around 8,400 won, the same as when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the implementation status of the government&#39;s hydrogen economy roadmap is far below the target.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Business Enterprises (Japan Business Federation) released a report titled ``Current Situation of the Hydrogen Economic Ecosystem and Policy Direction.&#39;&#39;
According to the report, the reality is that the hydrogen industry is largely dependent on countries such as the United States and Japan for the core parts and materials.
Carbon fiber, the core material for fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), and membrane membranes by DuPont (USA), Gore (USA), 3M (USA), and others.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six countries that lead the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
South Korea ranks fifth in the world in terms of the number of patents in the hydrogen production and fuel cell fields (2014-2020 cumulative).
However, the Japan Business Federation said, ``Six countries de facto occupy the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that they are actually at the bottom of the competing countries.&#39;&#39;
The ranking of patents by country is China, then the United States, then the EU, and then Japan.
Since 2017, China overtook the United States to take first place, and the gap has been widening ever since.
In terms of the number of patents registered in 2020, South Korea ranked fourth with 1,033 patents, surpassing Japan (974), but only 22% of China (4,721).
The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations proposed, ``Hydrogen technology should be designated as a ``national strategic technology,&#39;&#39; with large tax deductions for capital investment and research and development costs.&#39;&#39;

Don&#39;t forget that securing your address is a top priority.

Because of free competition, for example, if a branded product becomes more scarce than its regular price,
For example, it is considered legal for a painter to become famous and his price to go up.
The reason the Ps5 is being sold at such a high price is due to its scarcity value, and the value has simply increased from the list price.

US aid arms and ammunition arrive in Ukraine; also engages in troop training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) - U.S. State Department officials reported by Wednesday that equipment, including small arms and ammunition, had arrived in Ukraine under a security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The military aid is worth a total of $60 million (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and the final equipment, including four radars to pinpoint the firing points of mortars and other weapons, will be shipped to Ukraine in the new year.
The aid also included lethal weapons such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.
The purpose of the military assistance is to strengthen Ukraine&#39;s defense capabilities in response to the Russian military&#39;s efforts to increase its military strength near the border with Ukraine.
The United States has increased its vigilance over Russian military movements and is consulting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states to devise countermeasures in the event Russia launches an invasion of Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid to Ukraine&#39;s President Zelenskiy when he visited the US White House on September 1 of this year.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine reached approximately $450 million this year.
Since Russia forcibly annexed Ukraine&#39;s Crimea Peninsula, total aid has amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
U.S. forces are also engaged in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, the U.S. National Guard from Florida was deployed as part of a multilateral joint training program in support of Ukraine.
U.S. Special Operations Command in Europe also plays a major role in training and advising Ukrainian special forces, according to a Pentagon statement.
The number of U.S. special forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as it is a confidential matter.
President Biden had an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the 7th of this month, and there were some tense exchanges regarding the situation in Ukraine.
The United States is also prepared to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

Akira Amari, former head of the Liberal Democratic Party&#39;s Tax Commission, is directly confronted with the fate of the inheritance and gift tax ``review&#39;&#39; that would make living gifts ``forbidden&#39;&#39;!
The first feature in the December 18th issue of “Weekly Diamond” is “Talk with your family during the year-end and New Year holidays!
&quot;Living Gifts and Last-Minute Inheritance Techniques.&quot;
As discussions progress on the unification of inheritance tax and gift tax, there is a possibility that living gifts, which are the standard way to deal with inheritance tax, will become a &quot;prohibition&quot; in the near future, although this was abandoned in the 2022 tax reform outline due to concerns. is large.
How will the inheritance rules change?
In addition to a direct attack on former Liberal Democratic Party Tax Commission Chairman Akira Amari, a member of the House of Representatives, we will thoroughly teach you everything from the basics of gifts and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for making last-minute gifts that are advantageous before the end of the year.
(Hiroaki Miyahara, Diamond Editorial Department)
● Making inter vivos gifts ``forbidden&#39;&#39; for everyone from wealthy people to urban office workers ``From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will develop a tax system that is neutral to the selection of the timing of asset transfer. We will proceed with full-scale consideration toward the construction of a new facility.&#39;&#39;
A sentence of the 2021 tax reform outline announced by the ruling party last year caused great unrest not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
This is because what he is trying to say is to completely change the rules of inheritance and to prohibit a lifetime gift, which is the standard way to deal with inheritance tax, and thereby to significantly increase inheritance tax.
The golden rule for reducing inheritance tax, which is highly progressive, is to ``reduce the amount of assets subject to tax.&#39;&#39;
The most powerful trump card is a gift during life, and it has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by office workers whose homes are located in the three major metropolitan areas and who therefore incur a small inheritance tax.
In such a situation, a debate arose about ``integrating inheritance tax and gift tax.&#39;&#39;
Although there were concerns that the introduction would be the quickest, it was postponed in the 2022 tax reform outline announced on December 10th. As the system does not require any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family within the limits, the system will be subject to constant review.&#39;&#39; was launched again.
In an interview with this editorial department, Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party&#39;s tax system research committee, said:
``The most important thing is to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages that depend on the timing of property transfer, and to make the tax burden the same no matter when it is transferred.
We are currently running simulations to see what kind of problems will arise (due to the integration).&#39;&#39;If the reform is the fastest, there are only three chances left to make a living gift.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that there will be a major shift in the near future towards invalidating inter vivos gifts as a tax saving measure.
So, how exactly do the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

“My Righteous Brother” will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa “Please stay tuned!”
It has been decided that the FOD original drama ``My Righteous Brother&#39;&#39; starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast terrestrially on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
[Photo] Kasumi Yamatani who plays the heroine This work is based on the manga of the same name by Satoshi Morie, which has been serialized in Kodansha&#39;s &quot;BE LOVE&quot; since 2018, and is a heartbreaking pure love story between a man and a woman who carry their pasts on their backs.
Furukawa will play the main character, Mari, and Kasumi Yamatani will play the heroine, Riyo.
Riyo, a university student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi is a mysterious young man who suffers from insomnia every day, but for some reason he is able to sleep soundly with Riyo&#39;s help.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who resembles her older brother, who was separated from her parents due to their divorce, but one day she discovers that Kairi is a murderer.
・Yudai Furukawa comment The drama “My Righteous Brother” will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10th!
For those of you who weren&#39;t able to see it on FOD, please look forward to it, and for those of you who have already seen it, you&#39;ll be able to see the complex psychological depictions of Kairi and Riyo, their conflicts, and their changes. I think people will get to know this work more deeply if they can see how people are doing.
I hope fans of the original can enjoy it as well.
Please stay tuned!

[NFL] What and how did the players feel about the team that won by passing three times in one game? (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
Jones threw just three passes for the Patriots in this game.
This was the lowest number of passes in the past 50 years in the NFL since the Bills had two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.
The 1974 Bills had an unparalleled genius running back named OJ Simpson, who the previous season became the first team in history to exceed 2,000 yards in a season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with the runs of Simpson and running back Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason why the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and is similar in latitude to Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, the wind was blowing at 18 m/s, and there was a blizzard before the game.
Since the Bills are in their hometown, they didn&#39;t change their play selections much.
He passed 30 times and ran 25 times.
Allen was 15-of-30 passing for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions, so it wasn&#39;t a poor performance.
There were scoring opportunities, with four entries into the red zone in the 10-inning offensive series.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, in those three innings, he was only able to score three points with one FG.
Defense in front of the goal in the final stages of the game.
Trailing by four points, the Bills committed a penalty on 3rd &amp; 9, making it 3rd &amp; 14.
18 yards to goal.
On 3rd &amp; 14, QB Allen was surrounded by a rushing Patriots defense and drifted out of the pocket to the right.
He then threw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but missed.
In this play, ace WR Stefon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran shallow across and became free in front of the end zone, but Allen didn&#39;t seem to see it.
On 4th &amp; 18, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran into the end zone from the outside left, but the pass was hit by Patriots DB Miles Bryant in front of him and failed.
Bryant was covering Bills WR Cole Beasley man-to-man, but midway through, he saw Allen move and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen missed both receivers and threw passes into the end zone both times.
The pass on fourth down may have been a clincher, but there was no need for a TD on third down.
All it takes is two plays to get a first down.
It was still before the 2-minute mark, so Allen&#39;s ability to run his own runs would have been put to good use if he had made it to 4th and shortstop.

3 items that tend to stay in the kitchen for a long time, when it&#39;s time to throw them away and replace them (Harper&#39;s BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
sponge
No matter how often you change your sponges, you probably don&#39;t change them as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that even if you sterilize your kitchen sponges in the microwave every day, they still harbor a lot of bacteria (although sterilizing them in the microwave is still recommended).
The German researchers who conducted the study recommend changing your sponge once a week to keep it clean.
cutting board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says you should replace your cutting board when it starts to wear out and develop scratches and grooves.
Once the scratches and grooves develop, it becomes difficult to keep them clean and bacteria can breed.
If it&#39;s still OK, don&#39;t forget to disinfect it often with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach in 1 gallon of water.
Dip the surface of the cutting board into the liquid and let it sit for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and let air dry or pat dry with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken tableware
It may be heartbreaking to get rid of your favorite mug, but chipped surfaces can become a new breeding ground for bacteria and germs.
Additionally, chipped parts can cause cuts and spilled drinks.
Yes, this is your chance to buy your new favorite mug!

Community market and trading are different things
The community market uses the Steam payment system.
&gt;Since this feature allows you to conduct cash transactions with strangers, some people may fall victim to fraud where items are taken without them being paid.

For some reason, I feel embarrassed to own branded items.
You can carry items that are not conspicuous, but you cannot carry items that are bulky and have a monogram LV written on them, such as Louis Vuitton.
Why?
I think it&#39;s good that it fits your length.
By the way, I think it&#39;s fine in Japan.
If it&#39;s Japan. is.
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It&#39;s better to say it early, like, &quot;Why am I the only one who keeps calling me names?&quot;
So it doesn&#39;t matter because I&#39;m a foreigner? If you feel that way, it&#39;s better to simply say that you&#39;re uncomfortable.
I don&#39;t think I would ever dream of feeling uncomfortable, which is probably a fair chance.
I was living overseas during my time there, and there were quite a few Japanese people who went abroad, including myself, who didn&#39;t like the Confucian customs of upper and lower hierarchy, so I guess they&#39;ve lost their sense of style, and they can say whatever they want to the locals. I&#39;ve had that misunderstanding before.
If he looks like a Westerner, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s doing it out of pure malice, but out of some kind of sweetness or good-natured feeling.
When my friends are from Western countries, I always call them by their first names, but there are times when I get a little confused about which one to use when speaking in Japanese.
Well, it&#39;s okay if we&#39;re friends.
He&#39;s probably just doing what he does normally, but if he ignores it, he might not be able to stop being treated as an exception because he&#39;s a gaijin, so it&#39;s better to say it now.
Since it&#39;s Japan, I was wondering if you could talk according to Japanese rules.
Henshu: This is unrelated, but when my naturalized white friends toast at drinking parties, they always raise their glasses higher than other younger people.
I&#39;m definitely conscious of it, but I think it&#39;s a good habit because if you do that, both younger and older people won&#39;t look down on you or treat you like a Japanese person.
There are a lot of Japanese people (including myself) who look at such details regardless of their personality.

The translated text feels a little strange, but I can understand what it&#39;s trying to convey, and I think it&#39;s at a level that doesn&#39;t interfere with the game (I just feel this way, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem for others) I think you should also ask.)
I often see this level of translation in games produced overseas, and I feel that if it is a small company, the translation is well done.
I think that for people who are not native Japanese speakers, understanding the fine nuances of Japanese is something that can be achieved even after studying for a long period of time.
I don&#39;t know what level of skill you are looking for, but if you are looking for a level that Japanese people will not feel uncomfortable with, I think you should look for someone else.

Discussion ``Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&#39;&#39; Training is the battle.
&quot;Equivalent exchange of effort&quot; is a human anthem &lt;Commemorating the start of the anime &quot;Red Light District&quot;&gt; (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent manga for boys, ``Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&#39;&#39; is particularly different in that it has ``too much training.&#39;&#39;
It is a well-established theory that the training arcs, which have no battles and involve training day and night, are not popular with readers.
This can be inferred from the fact that in ``ONE PIECE&#39;&#39; from the same Jump manga, when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, they had been training for two years, but they only drew the touching parts and the rest was skipped over.
Well, one of One Piece&#39;s charms is the eccentricity of moving from place to place, and ``staying in the same place and training&#39;&#39; may not be so compatible.
Now, in the training of Tanjiro, the main character of &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,&quot; he kneeled down on the ground to Giyu Tomioka, who had saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who had tried to take his own life. Don&#39;t let me hold you!&#39;&#39; It can be said that it started when Giyu told him.
The weak have no rights or options; they can only be subdued by the strong by force.
While saying this, Giyuu was kind enough to introduce Urokotaki Sakonji, a ``nurturing teacher&#39;&#39; who trains those who want to join the Demon Slayer Corps (he&#39;s also a bad communicator who doesn&#39;t explain his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Urokodaki is when Tanjiro is asked, ``What would you do if your sister eats someone?&#39;&#39; Tanjiro is at a loss for an answer, and is told that he is slow in making decisions.
It&#39;s a seemingly unreasonable exchange that is talked about even among fans.
However, taking his younger sister, who has become a demon, with him carries the possibility that he may be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said to be an initiation into training from a mindset.
However, Urokodaki takes Tanjiro, an untrained amateur, to Mt. Sagiri and tells him to come down to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountain has thin air and is full of pitfalls, trebuchets, and traps, so I feel like I&#39;ll die before I can even begin my training.
Even so, he uses his keen sense of smell to pick up the faint scent of man-made traps and manages to avoid them, which is his ``protagonist correction.&#39;&#39;
Still, the essence of what makes Demon Slayer Demon Slayer is what makes Tanjiro say, ``But it doesn&#39;t mean that my physical abilities suddenly become so high that I can avoid them all!&#39;&#39;
Ordinary people don&#39;t suddenly become stronger without any backing, and when they awaken, they simply become able to use their ``powers and techniques that they have honed up until then to their true potential.&#39;&#39;
The ``equivalent exchange of efforts,&#39;&#39; where those who make an effort are rewarded only a little while those who make no effort are rewarded nothing, is an ode to humans who are different from demons who have unfounded supernatural powers, and this work It is a rule that is consistent and difficult to implement.
Is this old?
I still sleep on a mat directly in my house, on a futon, and on a comforter instead of on a bed.
My house is not an apartment.
I do that too.
If you want to use a larger room, it&#39;s better to sleep on a futon than on a bed.
I think there are many people like that.
Is it tough?
Are people who work part-time and want to work full-time and work at other stores reluctantly?
No, I don&#39;t really think so.
In that case, it doesn&#39;t fall under the category of &quot;gametsui&quot; that I think of.
In other words, I think of ``gametsui&#39;&#39; as a plan to somehow gain more profit than the effort with the minimum amount of effort.

Samsung Electronics of South Korea establishes a new &quot;DX division&quot; that integrates home appliances and mobile, &quot;emphasizing user experience&quot; (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo! News
Following Samsung Electronics&#39; integration of its CE and IM divisions into a set division, the company announced on the 12th that it will be renamed DX (Device eXperience) and that this will be reflected in its organizational reorganization at the end of the year.
It can be seen that the company aims to enhance the user experience through a variety of services ranging from mobile devices to home appliances.
Samsung Electronics announced that the newly launched DX division, which was created by merging the CE and IM divisions, will consist of business divisions such as VD (Visual Display), household appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and networks.
A Samsung Electronics official explained, ``This name change reflects our medium- to long-term business structure, future orientation, and strengthening of our global leadership.&#39;&#39;
The company also emphasized its intention to make it easy for consumers to enjoy an optimized experience not only through products such as televisions, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment, but also through services and solutions that reflect customer needs. Ta.
With the launch of the integrated leadership structure, the name also reflects the company&#39;s strategy to transcend organizational boundaries, create company-wide synergies, and build a foundation for differentiated products and services.
Through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council, Samsung Electronics has already announced that users can enjoy content through the linkage between devices such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). We are currently developing a strategy that will allow users to freely use services such as:

This is a little unnatural.
The larvae of the beetle lie in wait in the sand so that they can catch their prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped heads peeking out from the sand.
I think it should be.
What I&#39;m curious about is

* Are you looking from an ant&#39;s perspective?
Is not it.
If you translate &quot;armoured heads&quot; as disk-shaped heads, I think the part that says &quot;on the scale of an ant, it&#39;s a giant beast wearing a helmet&quot; disappears...
24-vehicle collision in Aichi; trailer driver had no chronic illness; was he careless? (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
It has been learned that the trailer driver who was arrested and sent to the prosecutor&#39;s office after a 24-vehicle collision in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, did not have any chronic illness and that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 vehicles, including trucks and cars, collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, resulting in 12 people suffering minor injuries.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura (54), who was driving the trailer, on suspicion of causing the first rear-end accident and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the prosecutor&#39;s office on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura&#39;s trailer continued to move forward without applying the brakes even after the accident, and the fire department also confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura did not have any chronic illness, and it appears that some kind of carelessness was the cause of the incident.
Police are searching the homes of the parties involved and investigating the circumstances at the time in detail.

Oginuma X&#39;s Kinnikuman Review [Volume 4 of Comics] (Weekly News) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which started in Volume 3, concludes with Volume 4!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicts everything from the opening match to the semi-final match in one go, it focuses on only one match, so it&#39;s packed with new features!
●“Kinnikuman” Volume 4 Reviewer name: Oginuma
In short, this volume 4 is a book that carefully and carefully depicts the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing I want to keep in mind is that it is by no means a volume that only depicts the match in the ring. That means no.
Starting from the signing ceremony, we watched each other&#39;s battles to control each other, and the scenes of special training, so it was very different from what we had seen before, and it took a while for us to get to the game, but it was by no means boring.
The sense of tension that gradually builds as the battle of the century is about to begin is sure to heighten the reader&#39;s excitement, and I am truly impressed by how well-calculated the production is even during this period.
And before the important final, there&#39;s one more thing you can&#39;t miss: the 3rd place deciding match between Terryman and Ramenman.
Aside from the gorgeousness of the match card, my favorite part is when Ramen Man stands backstage before the match and says to the Kinnikuman poster, &quot;Now it&#39;s my turn to aim!&quot;
and tries to hit him with a chop.
However, Terryman, who happens to be passing by, intercepts the sword and blocks it, and they stare at each other in silence, and then they part ways.
What&#39;s amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated and there will be no more chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there is something about Kinnikuman that makes me so anxious.
When you see something like this, you can&#39;t help but think about what he will do in the distant future!
As a manga artist, this scene still makes me keenly aware that this is what makes a character stand out!
The fight between the two doesn&#39;t take long, but the famous scene is Ramen Man&#39;s tearful appeal after the match.
To Kinnikuman, &quot;Don&#39;t rely on the strength of divine luck!&quot;
That&#39;s the line.
This is a grand meta-statement about the work itself, and up until now, I think readers have felt that Kinnikuman doesn&#39;t lose because he&#39;s the main character, and that he somehow manages to win in ways that aren&#39;t based on his actual ability.
However, by having Ramen Man make this comment, Yudetamago-sensei took the initiative and warned him that he would no longer be able to do that.
This sentence makes the reader think, ``So, is Kinnikuman really going to defeat Robin with his own strength?
how ? ”
This unpredictable development will stir your imagination once again, and if you look at it from a writer&#39;s perspective, this line is almost as if Yudetamago-sensei, the creator of the work, has imposed a constraint on himself.
I thought this was an amazing thing.
I think this is definitely one of the major points of this volume.

&quot;Vanitas&#39; Notes&quot;
The first season was interesting so I continued it.
“I can’t go on air!”
A long time ago, when I was reading Da Vinci at the library, I saw it introduced and thought it looked interesting, but I&#39;m half excited and half nervous.

Life wouldn&#39;t be fun if you didn&#39;t have any hobbies, right?
It&#39;s more fun if you have something you want to do, whether it&#39;s work or something that you&#39;re passionate about, even if it&#39;s not just a hobby.
Winter illumination weekend held in Aobayama, Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
The first winter illumination has begun at Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, and the park is bathed in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illuminations that began on November 26 include a 20-meter-tall camphor tree, as well as 50,000 LED light bulbs scattered along walking paths and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, ``I came to Fukui for the first time in a while and was surprised that a place like this existed.
It&#39;s so beautiful and I feel so relieved,&quot; she said.
The illumination was planned for the first time to provide a soothing feeling while avoiding crowds, and will be lit from 5:00 pm to 8:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25th.
Also, on the final day, the 25th, there will be a Christmas event, including a button pot performance and a movie screening.
I think there are only a limited number of people who can read through a document in order.
I have a friend who can read a lot, and I asked him about it, and he was able to do that, but he had steadily solidified his knowledge of Linux from the basics, and rather than reading documents, he read the table of contents in reference books and started reading from the parts that interested him.
(Actually, it is easier to apply and understand learning from something like Linux than to start with something as abstract as Docker.
It&#39;s quite difficult to leave that out and try to understand everything all at once.
It&#39;s fine if you understand...
) You don&#39;t have to do them in order.
Also, I don&#39;t try to memorize the contents, but I tend to vaguely memorize the parts I skipped over and read them when I need them.
I didn&#39;t read anything at all and just tried to break it down and read it over and over again, so I gradually started reading more and more.

Online distribution, PR of agricultural and livestock products Okitama Agricultural Promotion Association, broadcast from Yonezawa | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Okitama Agricultural Promotion Council, which is made up of municipalities in the Okitama area, JA, and others, conducted PR activities for agricultural and livestock products using ``live commerce,&#39;&#39; which sells products while streaming videos over the Internet.
Ai Yamagata Bushotai and others appeared remotely on the ``National Collaborative MINATO Market TV&#39;&#39;, which was planned for the first time by Minato Ward, Tokyo, and delivered local specialties and the charm of the region.
The store was decided to open because of the Okitama x Minato Port Opening Project, an initiative in which the Okitama region and Minato Ward collaborate, and the event was broadcast from the Satoyama Vision House in Minamibara Shinmachi, Yonezawa City.
Mika Kuroda, who works as a &quot;satoyama sommelier&quot;, wore a stole from the Yonezawa textile brand &quot;nitorito&quot; and introduced the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
We also reported on the imoni party with the Bushotai of Love.
At the Tokyo studio, Emiko Kawamura of the comedy duo &quot;Tanpopo&quot; and YouTubers with over 300,000 subscribers sampled Okitama&#39;s local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, Tsuyahime, and more.
When I told the viewers how delicious it was, I received comments such as ``I can feel the smell even though it&#39;s being streamed&#39;&#39; and ``It&#39;s the best with so many delicious things to go with alcohol.&#39;&#39;

I would like to plant bellflowers in my garden.
Are bellflowers resistant to summer heat?
If so, once the flowers have finished blooming in the spring, cut the stems leaving 10 to 15 cm.
Branches will emerge from the base of the leaves, so look forward to them.

Unfortunately this morning...
My NAS PC no longer turns on 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
~What happened~
1.) Open the window in the morning for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is powered on.
2.) When I returned to my room after a while, I noticed that my PC was making a noise similar to a pink rotor, so I shut it down for now.
At this point, I thought that the fan movement was only slowing down due to the drop in room temperature (6 degrees Celsius).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Doesn&#39;t start.
When I press the power button, the power light comes on for a moment and the fan starts, but then stops.
After that, I didn&#39;t say anything.
I unplug the power plug and try again, but it still only stays on for a moment.
4.) I tried connecting only the ATX 20 pin and 4 pin to the motherboard and removing other parts, but it did not start.
5.) I&#39;ve been hearing some humming noises like the PSU fan is hitting something, so I suspect the PSU is the culprit.
I&#39;ll find a spare ATX power supply and try it out later.
perhaps.
If it doesn&#39;t work...what should I do?
Should I change the case and mother together?
Have you seen a wild rabbit recently (within the last 4-5 years)?
Where did you see it?
Is it a place surrounded by nature?
I live in Tohoku.
They&#39;re everywhere near me.
They can also be found in gardens and company parking lots.
Ranking of most used emojis in 2021 (Gizmodo Japan) - Yahoo! News
The most frequently used emoji for me is a crying emoji.
I believe that emojis are an essential communication tool for modern people.
Recently, many messaging apps and chat tools allow you to use emoji reactions instead of stamps.
Speedy, easy, no need to reply, soothing factor.
Emojis are essential for the soft atmosphere that is so useful in modern communication!
So, what kind of emojis does everyone use?
[See all images] Ranking of most used emojis in 2021 Top 10 most used emojis around the world in 2021!
Overall, positive and cheerful emojis are ranked.
According to Unicode, the source of the story, 92% of the world&#39;s internet population uses emojis.
The first place accounts for 5% of all emoji usage!
The crying and laughing emojis in 1st, 3rd and 5th place are very easy to use.
Of course I did it when I was having fun and when I was happy!
I think there are many people who use it in a self-deprecating way even when they feel like they can&#39;t do anything about it.
On the other hand, if you have never used any of the top 10 emojis, you are among the rarest.
I want you to stick to that style.

How do you dispose of your computer and peripherals?
* PC farm
I&#39;ve only brought it in once, but even though it&#39;s in Misato City, Saitama Prefecture, Saitama Prefecture won&#39;t collect it for free.
(Free if relatively new)
* Inverse Net
I&#39;ve never used it, but with Sagawa, shipping is completely free with cash on delivery.
I&#39;m thinking of trying it out, so if anyone knows about it, I&#39;d like to hear your feedback.
* Oversized garbage (charges apply), P.S. &gt; Local government collection box (small home appliances free)
* Sell second hand.
P.S. &gt; Mercari, Hard Off
Is there anyone who sells it at flea markets or auctions? I have never sold a used PC.
It might be a smart choice to sell while you still have money.
* P.S.&gt; Lynette Japan Information provided by: /u/CheetahPresent8059
A broken printer, an old UPS, etc. that no one would pick up have become a nuisance.
It&#39;s not the bulky garbage size, so it probably won&#39;t cost anything, but I&#39;ve been putting it off for some reason.
I collect coins as a hobby.
If anyone knows how much this coin is worth, please let me know.
Coins circulating in foreign countries have no value. ．． ．．
In Japan, banknotes are exchanged, but coins are not exchanged.
Commemorative gold coins have gold in them, so they have value.
Even though he hasn&#39;t done anything wrong, you still hate him, right?
Yes, we are humans, so it is natural for us to have likes and dislikes.
``I don&#39;t like something (for no reason)&#39;&#39; - that&#39;s what haters are like.

I can&#39;t find a girlfriend, but maybe I&#39;m being discriminated against because of my face?
It&#39;s not your face, it&#39;s your heart.
But it&#39;s sad that people can decide based on their appearance.
Because you can&#39;t show what&#39;s inside.
What did you do with your school sports clothes after graduation?
I wear it as everyday wear ^_^
I gave up right after graduating.

Is it possible for a person to become a real person at any time, even if he or she is over 90 or 100 years old?
All sexual desire and youth are lost.
If you are healthy.

I would like to plant a tree in my garden that will act as a blindfold.If you have any tree recommendations, please let me know.
My preference would be for an evergreen tree that is easy to care for, preferably one that produces fruit.
thank you.
For feijoa to bear fruit, it is best to plant other fruit-bearing trees such as olives, blueberries, and plums nearby.
How much savings does each person need to be able to live together comfortably?
It depends on each person.
It depends on where you live and what kind of relationship you have.
It&#39;s better not to live together.
There is a high possibility that they will break up.
It&#39;s better to find a matchmaker, hold the betrothal ceremony, go to various bridal parties, and hold the wedding and reception.
There is no benefit to living together.
I think it&#39;s better to stop...
I went to the game center today and played an arcade game called Kamen Rider Battle Ganbarizing.
