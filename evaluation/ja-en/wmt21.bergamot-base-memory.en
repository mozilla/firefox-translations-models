Add a layer to a semi-long with weight [Minami no zanpu] to fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka, "Of course it is beautiful, but I have a very high sense of professionalism and I respect it!"
I asked Mitsuteru Asahi of the Omotesando hair salon "SUNVALLY" who is actually working on the haircut of Minami Tanaka, and I asked him to make it "Minami Sane-style hair".
Report that cut process!
Nogizaka46 Yamashita Mizuki, short hair and first cover!
First, check your hair before cutting.
Thin, soft, and more.
It is a habit, and you can also apply a straight perm, especially in the rainy season.
It is a heavy semi-long with a sink forelock.
Finally, the cut begins!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole thing.
After that, divide the top of the bee (the part above the most protruding area of the head) and cut it from below.
By the way, the point of hair that brings everyone closer to Minoru is here!
1 Tabulbang By shortening the inside of the bangs a little, it becomes a little thicker when you lower it with full, and if you divide it lightly, the skin can be see-through ..., you can enjoy the change depending on the styling.
2 Cuts that make use of habit If you have a habit of multiple hairs, if you reduce the amount of hair too much, it may spread.
While consulting about the balance around it, it is easy to handle and it is difficult to spread, and keep the balance that your own swell will live.
3 Layers and hair around the face Layer = Cutting cut with a step.
If you put a layer around the face, it will be easier to move, and it will be a cute finish.
If you make the hair in three places, the front and back of the temple, the umiage, and the hair will look fashionable even when you put it together quickly.
If you cut the hair on the bee that was divided, it is around the face.
Pull out the hair bundle of the upper part around the face in front and cut the hair tip.
In this way, when the hair bundle is lowered, the steps will be attached, making it easier to move (this is the layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura "Partnering with Guruna" on Coronavirus (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
On the 20th, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura, 45, made a remote appearance from the prefectural government on ABC TV "Cast" (Monday to Friday, March 48) and said that he was considering a partnership with the restaurant information website "Gurunabi" as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
Since the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture has issued a "Infection Prevention Declaration Sticker" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to citizens.
However, only eleven thousand restaurants have issued stickers in the prefecture, which is said to be more than one hundred and twenty thousand.
So Governor Yoshimura said, “I’m going to do it at the end of the month, but I’m going to partner with ‘Gurunavi’ and when I make a reservation, I’ll open a publisher of the declaration sticker and make it clear at the reservation stage,” and declared a tag with the Internet reservation site.
"The important thing is not to lump it together with the "night city". It should be clearly divided between the shops that are dealing with infectious diseases and the shops that do not do it. It is also important to make efforts to increase the number of stores that will do it," he said.

● Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte ○ <10th round · MetLife Dome> Lotte throws nine 136 balls alone by Atsushi Tsutaichi, a professional first complete seal that is happy in the fourth year.
He won his third victory in this season's Pa League complete-up Ichiban, and stopped the team's consecutive defeats by two.
In the first inning, Taneichi allowed the leading Shohei Suzuki to hit a two-run homer to break the third base line, but immediately after he struck out Sosuke Genda with three rumblings, and General Suzuki, who was aiming for advance to third base, also touched out at third base during this time.
Helped by the calm response of the ally defense, if you cut through the pinch of the stand with zero, after two times, the combination of sliders and forks centered on the proud straight.
Raise your ass and line up the scoreboard with zero.
The strikeout line was a hit by Keisuke Honda, the opponent's starter, but Goshi Kanno, the leading third in the seventh, came out on base in the fourth, and Oumi Oka, a substitute run, succeeded in two steals.
On this chance, Naonori Yasuda, the fourth, unleashed a right-hand shot of the price of money, and finally broke the balance.
Then, in the next eight innings, he attacked his opponent, third-placed Tetsu Miyagawa, and scored four goals in a row, including a two-run shot in the left middle, which was his first time after the transfer of Kei Toriya, who was on the way.
I folded it up to push the young ace candidate of the Marines, and decided to compete at once.
Taneichi dismissed the three-way retreat eight times, and nine consecutive throws over a hundred balls.
"I was strong" and invited a pinch of the second death full base in consecutive four balls, but at the end, I took the 10th strikeout of the day with a high straight from Spandenberg and set the game.
He smiled and bit the joy.
Bye-bye to the accident in the new operation, cooperation with Tsuruoka Police Station and related organizations Safety awareness|Yamagata Shimbun
In the bicycle class held as the start of the operation, a collision experiment between a car and a bicycle was conducted = Tsuruoka City · Shoko Gakuen Automobile Driving School
In recent years, the Tsuruoka Police Department (Chief Police Chief Kagezo Sato) has launched a "By-By Zero Accident Operation" in order to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which are highly proportioned in the prefecture.
In addition to promoting awareness of accident prevention with traffic safety groups in the prefecture, we will embark on strengthening the crackdown on traffic rules violations of bicycles.
Three traffic fatalities occurred this year in the department, and a person who was driving a motorcycle or bicycle was killed.
Although the number of accidents has been on a downward trend, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles has increased to about 11.7 percent as of June 30, and about 5.8% for motorcycles, both of which are higher than the prefecture average.
In particular, the percentage of bicycle accidents in the past five years has exceeded the prefecture's average, and we planned a plan to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was "bike" and "bicycle", which combined the meaning of accident eradication.
Related organizations will be called more than ever by traffic safety classes to provide driving guidance to the elderly and the use of night light reflectors.
The police department will issue a yellow card (guidance warning slip) at the time of the crackdown, etc., and urge caution.
The commencement ceremony of the operation was held at the Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City on the 21st.
About thirty people involved attended, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in order to reduce even one tragic accident."
The staff of the police showed the policy and the activities of each organization.
As a start of the operation, a bicycle class will be held.
The police officer in the car demonstrated how the impact on the bike differs between the collision of the bicycle with the brake on and the collision at about 55km/h without stepping on the brake.
Koichi Kanauchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Traffic Safety Activities Promotion Committee, said, “I realized the horrors of traffic accidents again. I would like to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people.”

Kisuke Kaminarimon, a 75-year-old rakugo storyteller based in Akasaka-tei, and others invited the laughter of visitors to their professional storytelling.
At the request of a vassal who was given a ban from alcohol by the lord, Kisuke shows off "No Sake Ban-ya" where a sake shop that tries to bring sake engages in a funny exchange with the monban.
I laughed many times with my teethy talk and the delicious drinking.
A 58-year-old company employee who visited the couple, Naka-ku, Okayama-shi, smiles, "The way of talking and interplay is exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "The tone of the voice was not good at the performance for a long time, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo storyteller Koru Katsura (31) also performed at the Tsuyama Magic Club, a magic group in Osaka City.
The former Akasaka-cho opened as the first public yose in Japan.
He continued to hold regular yose and yose once a month, but due to the influence of the new corona, he canceled the yose at the end of the performance in February this year.

He was one of the few non-ruling governors in Russia, but was detained by security officials on the 9th of this month.
The charges were announced as involvement in two of the industrial killings of businessmen between 04 and 05.

Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, the future of the Heat, "Thoughts are not that of a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo! News
Photo by Getty Images The first match of the heat's scrimage (practice match) is against the Kings.
In this match, which was won 104-098, Duncan Robinson scored 18 team-highs, followed by Tyler Hero's 15th score and backcourt performance.
Not only Robinson, one of the league's leading shooters, but also the 13th-ranked rookie and hero's step-up is an important factor for the Heat.
The hero missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season went into a long break at the end of the March 12th match against the Hornets, which was his return.
The hero said, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to regain my condition. It's the best feeling I've ever felt," but the performance at Scrimage was more convincing than words.
Due to the delay in the joining of the starting point guard, Kendrick Nan, the hero's playing time increased, and the form took advantage of that opportunity.
It is worth a lot because it is fifteen points after doing a different role than usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once praised his favorite hero.
“He can handle, he can score, he can score, he can defend. He can do everything for the team. He can do everything for the team. The way he can do it is not that of a rookie because his way of thinking is not that of a rookie. He studies by looking at the video, where his teammates move and how they are free, and he’s hammering into his head where his teammates move and how they’re free, and what they should do about it.”
Even before the start of the season, Butler likes the strength of the hero's rookie and his stoic attitude towards basketball.
That's why I was invited to individual practice starting at four in the morning, and we trained together.
Butler once said, “He has his own opinion on everyone, and he doesn’t back down. I can respect that kind of fighting spirit.”
Butler is the type of person who always says what he thought, and if he thinks it is for the sake of the team, he knows that there will be a collision, and he will hit a harsh opinion.
As a result, my relationship with my teammates has deteriorated in the past.
Butler is probably superimposing himself as a hero in his youth.
Butler’s personality, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have enough guts to come about.
If the relationship between two teachers and pupils who respect each other spreads throughout the team, the Heat should be able to become a team that can aim higher.

▽4th round (1st game) Hamamatsu Johokuko 0000000-0 410000×-5 Shimada Sho ▽Match time 1 hour 26 minutes
[Review] Shimada Sho took advantage of the early opportunity and won the Hamamatsu-jo Hokuko.
Shimada Sho took the lead with a timely two-point hit by Matsuura at first base.
He added two more points with Uchinogoro and Squiz.
In the first inning, Saito, who started, showed a good throw with only one hit in six innings.
Hamamatsu Johokuko did not take advantage of the opportunity of the second base of the last time.
Three years in the four-run race.
Two years, thanks to the first strike.
The opponent's departure was the 4th in the first two years of this summer.
Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit a changeup ball at first base without death and carried it to the left.
“If I lose three years, I will retire immediately. I wanted to hit and win.”
The 4th grader last year was also on the chest.
The 1 to 3 rounds were fought mainly for three years, and the two years of power were in the middle.
Director Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nine, “It’s been three years so far, and I’m going to be the best member in the future.”
On this day, four of the nine stamens solidified their main axis in two years.
It seems ruthless, but it is proof that it is committed to a serious game.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of opponent pitchers will also increase. I will go with the intention of returning the runners."
Saito, who had pitched six innings, did not even step on second base with a good throw that limited his six innings to one hit, and showed his intention for three years.
The number ten is a positive synergy, saying, "I will be stimulated for three years by coming out for two years. If it leads to victory."
The team aiming to make four strong for the third year in a row with the Shizuoka tournament until last year is not going to make memories of the remaining games.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world of singing voices with the residents (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo! News
I want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka, and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima gathered to create a message song.
The lyrics include a dedicated figure of Fukushima Prefecture fighting against the novel coronavirus as he made his journey toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
The song will be infused with the voices of the people of the prefecture, and the "complete version" will be completed by next summer, which marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video posting site "YouTube".
The song is called “Pray from Fukushima.”
We will put the feeling of "I want to convey the positive attitude of people from Fukushima" with a bright and energetic melody.
Due to the impact of the new coronavirus, the live house, which is the base of music activities, was forced to close, and many musicians lost the place to perform songs and performances.
It was planned by singer-songwriter nappo (Nappo) (46) living in Minamisoma City and DAZU-O (37) of the music group "Mehikari Boys" in Iwaki City, in order to believe in the power of music because it is a time when the future is not possible.
Mr. Nappo wrote the lyrics and composed the song, and Mr. Dazuo was in charge of the rap.
When the project started in March of the coronavirus pandemic, singer-songwriters MANAMI (28) and Jun Kanno (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in an instant.
Mr. Nappo said, "It became a luxurious face that can not be thought of in normal times. I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest."
There were no opportunities for sixteen people to gather as a measure against infection, and each recorded it at a live house or at home.
In order to support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew down the image character.
It depicts the climate rich in nature with blue and green in the shape of Fukushima Prefecture.
The finished song will be sent to the world on YouTube, and the aim is to make it into a CD.
Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, and the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, which have been postponed, are scheduled to be held.
Mr. Dazuo said, "What we have overcome difficulties is a big burden. I hope that by releasing the song at the milestone, it will be encouraging for many people."
Other participating musicians are as follows:

Instant detection of crisis outbreak from Internet information, judgment of hoax (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
“I want to know as soon as possible where and what kind of disaster and accident occurred!”
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but there is a strong need for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
The service that responds to this is "Specty" developed by Spectee, which is engaged in information analysis using AI.
[Photo] Expert team judges the authenticity of social media information with alerts from Specty
Now, the first way for people to know about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to social media.
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident.
However, it is difficult to constantly watch over-the-toow information and extract useful information from it by hand.
Specti has the function of detecting information that flows on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc., to detect things related to natural disasters and accidents, analyze the contents, judge the authenticity of the information, and distribute it to the company of use.
"We have positioned a wide range of negative events that have a negative impact that will stop or stagnate" (CEO Kenjiro Murakami), and this is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
NHK was the first major use case of Specti, and since then, the movement of recruitment has spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to news organizations such as TV stations and newspapers, more than three hundred and fifty companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and local governments all over the country, are currently using Specti.
■ Analyze the post to determine the type and place of occurrence of "crisis"
Specti distributes information through four steps: collection of information, analysis and content classification, titleding, and authenticity.
Companies should specify in advance the areas where they collect information (e.g. prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and categories of crises (disasters, accidents, etc.).
Specti collects posts that fall under that designation using the API provided by social media.
Next, analyze and classify the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video of a fire engine being shown, black smoke rising from the building, and an orange flame coming out of the room, it is classified as a “fire”.
In addition, if it is an image of a overturned car, it is classified as "traffic accident", and if it is an image of a road covered with water, it is classified like "road flood".
Specti also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from the post, so we combine various information and estimate it," says CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, information on the place name is extracted from it, and the place name is checked with the place name database to identify the place.
Angels lose bye-bye in opening game... Ohtani hits five, one, nine innings, three-run triple at full base (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
○ Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <Oakland Coliseum> The Angels' Shohei Ohtani (26) made a starter in the opening game against the Athletics on July 24 (Japan time 25).
In the first inning, he gave up his first hit of the season, but the four batters after that were mediocre and one hit in five innings.
Otani played against Montana again at first base with three times.
In the third inning of the fifth inning, which he picked up at 1-1, he struck out in the second inning against his right-hander, Petitt, at first base, and fell in a row.
In the fourth inning of the eighth inning, which he picked up with a 2-1 and one-point lead, he faced Diekman, who was fifth left-hander in the fifth as the leading hitter.
He played straight at the second ball in the opposite direction with a good angle, but it did not go over the fence and fell to the left fly.
The Angels took a one-point lead in the bottom of the eighth inning, and the relief right-hander, Batley, lost two points and allowed a reversal, but the ninth inning, which was missing, Castro, the new catcher's 7th, moved to the right wing.
He caught up to a 3-3 tie at the last minute.
After that, he died two, hit a second base, and hit a second, Trout.
The Athletics bench shunned Trout here and chose the Ohtani game at second base.
It was Otani who was expected to win over, but three balls in front of the Asletic guardian deity Hendrix.
The game was not settled in nine innings and entered an extended game starting with a special case of deathless second base this season.
Ohtani was the last hitter in the ninth, so he was a second baseman.
The Angels hit a 10-run homer in the first inning, Walsh, but Olson, who had hit a good hit, sent a ball to third base.
Otani, who was sandwiched between second and third base, became a touchout.
The Angels then hit a two-run homer, but in the end, the eighth-inning Simmons fell to a two-run homour.
On the back of that, the Angels continued to throw in the innings, and Robles hit a pitch, throwing a ball, a blow, and so on, and a pinch at third base.
Here, Maddon's new manager made a shift to make Uchino five, but Robles walked in the fourth and Davis in the fourth and took a full base.
Milner, who was replaced by a left-hander, was brought to the right-wing seats by a full-base bullet that would be goodbye to Olson in the fifth.

"A word that I thought was not a dialect seriously" ( ねとらぼ ) - Yahoo! News
I am a Chiba resident close to Tokyo.
Thirty years after I was born, I live in the same prefecture.
When I used it in a conversation with a friend of a university (Tokyo), it was made to be a kyoton for a moment.
I was able to understand the meaning by the flow and the sense of word, but the people of Tokyo and Saitama said that I would not use it.
―― Certainly, “Is it going to be a mess → cheat and cross?”
As a result, you can guess what it means.
Then one more thing.
I did not notice this when it was pointed out, but the expression “inchi” meaning “my house” was not used at all even if I read a book, etc., and I did not listen to it from my friends, so when I looked it up after I became an adult, it was a dialect.

Japan's "Cold Chinese" is not Chinese ... ?
"Cold noodle dish" unpopular reason (modern business) - Yahoo! News
Chilled Chinese in China is "Japanese-style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese cuisine (Japanese-style Chinese) originating in Japan, which was conceived based on the Chinese "Ryo-Ryo" (Lyanbammien / Chilled Mixed Soba).
Therefore, it does not exist in China originally, but due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also appeared with arrangements called "Nishiki Soba Ryomen / Soba Chilled Chinese" and "Kawakodori Koi Ryomen / Sichuan Style Chicken Chilled Chinese".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China is generally not high due to the fact that it is pushed by popular Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the seasoning of the Japanese Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it is not bad, but if the impact is poor, it tends to be criticized.
"Cold Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor existence in China.
By the way, the name of the chilled Chinese in China is "Nippy cold noodles".
The Chinese are recognized as one of the Japanese cuisines.
The classic of summer is "Ryosen (Ryanpy)"
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is probably “Ryangpi”.
In Japan, I think that many people are not familiar, but cool skin is a flat noodle made of flour, rice flour, starch, etc. originating in Shaanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of two thousand years.
It is a classic of B-grade gourmets sold at stalls, and the price is around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen), which is very reasonable.
There is a word "涼" in it, but like cold Chinese in Japan, it is not covered with ice.
Rather, the temperature is basic.
On top of the noodles, topped with favorite ingredients such as shredded cucumbers, carrots, boiled bean sprouts, and other condiments such as coak chi, chili pepper, ginger, garlic, etc. are added.
Finally, a special seasoning is added to the mixture of soy sauce, lar oil, vinegar, sesamer paste, peanut paste, etc., and it is completed.
The noodles are smooth and plump, and the sourness is refreshing and rich, and the thick spicy sauce is well entangled, and it goes in smoothly even when there is no appetite.
In addition, because it has spread throughout China, various toppings and flavors are available, and the variety is also a feature of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

The benefits of "cold water shower" to the body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Reduce inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in the North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water-based therapies) found that it was expected to be effective for physical and mental healing.
By taking cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, who is in charge of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine, and teaches at the University of Connecticut, “It is important to exercise and take a cold shower without spending as much time as possible. After moving your body, you can immediately lower your body temperature, and recover from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise will be faster.”
Reduce fatigue
When you exercise in a high temperature, your heart, muscles, and skin will need more blood flow than usual.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, so you have more blood flow to your heart, and you need more energy to shrink your muscles, so you have more muscle blood flow. Also, when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature," Professor Casa said.
“By taking a cold water shower, the temperature of the skin decreases, so the amount of blood flow sent to the skin can be reduced. Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, so water and nutrition are more likely to be taken after exercise. As a result, it can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise.”
Expected for the hormesis effect
Drozevsky also explains that the "hormesis effect" can be activated by taking cold water.
The hormesis effect is the idea that substances and stress that are harmful to the body should be a little more than not at all.
“Hydax exercise, petit fasting, and cold showers are typical examples of how to expect a hormesis effect for health. Taking a cold shower can stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, increasing physical and physical resilience and resilience.”

Hanshin · Oyama, two consecutive shots 7th!
Director Yano "Looking at it is a style" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Se League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin four wins and three losses, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of the 4th does not stop.
The ball that soared high landed in the middle of the left seat.
Oyama released the arch for the second consecutive race, and circled the diamond.
When I got back to the bench, I saw my white teeth.
"I was able to squeeze the target ball and take the plunge and swing while I was making a good swing."
He struck out four in the 0-2 inning in the first.
I waved aggressively from the first ball, the second ball after the foul.
I didn't miss Ohno's sweet 134kg slider.
The ball caught at the core is so perfect that you can be sure of the stand-in at the moment of hitting.
The two consecutive games following the battle of Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day were a counterattack.
It was also a valuable one that I hit from the opponent who was unhappy.
When he faced Ohno in Koshien on the 17th, he scored four runs in nine innings.
However, in the case of the Nagoya Dome, he allowed seven wins, one loss, one hold in twelve games in the past, and was tormented by seven consecutive defeats after a draw from August 23rd.
From such a difficult opponent at the Nagoya Dome, he took the score for the first time in twenty-three innings (counting one inning on the middle of the climb) with a big shot and did not pass the flow of the game.
Director Yano also said, "The level is high that you can be killed firmly with a sweet ball. There is a style to look at, and there is an atmosphere even if the timing of hitting is a foul. I think that it will still hit me."
In one sight, he left the right forehand hit alone, and this marked six consecutive hits and three consecutive hits.
The opening started, but he has already worked impeccably as the team's top and fourth, with seven home runs and 16 runs batted in.
For the sake of victory, we will continue to leave results from now on.

About 40 casino facilities in Macau have been closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 under the COVID-19 outbreak, and have resumed operations after strict epidemic prevention measures since the 20th of the same month.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Agency (DICJ) has asked the operating company to protect the health of its employees and guests to the maximum extent possible, and has determined that the distance between gaming (casino) tables will be secured, and that table games can seat next to each other (e.g., three to four people can sit at one table at the same time in a baccarat table), and that one or two slot machines will also operate every other, reducing the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming products such as chips has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, take a temperature, and present an effective health code (the most recent stay, whether they have been in contact with a new coronavirus patient, whether they have symptoms such as fever or cough, and those generated by entering contact information).
From midnight on July 15th, a negative certificate of new coronavirus nucleic acid test (limited to those within the validity period issued by the authorized facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) has also been added to the condition.
The new negativity certificate is required to be presented in the background of the relaxation of border measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6am on the 15th (removal of quarantine quarantine for fourteen days, with conditions), and it will be a preventive measure associated with this.
On July 18th, DICJ announced that in response to the change in the conditions of admission from the 15th of the same month, the bureau's director General Adriano Ho and others observed the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at the casino facility, and held a meeting to convene representatives of the security departments of six casino operators, and asked them to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing the admission of guests.
The DICJ said it would continue to carry out strict patrol patrols of casino facilities and have regular meetings with the operating company in accordance with the situation and assessment, and indicated its policy of adjusting the epidemic prevention measures at the casino as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau.
Mr. Hayashimatsu, Director of the Centers for Disease Supervision and Prevention of Diseases, Health Bureau, and others accompanied the inspection of the casino facilities, and guidance was provided on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips at the site and how to take a safe distance between seats of electronic casino equipment.
In addition, due to the drastic decrease in inbound tourists due to epidemic prevention measures including entry restrictions, casino sales in the January-June quarter of this year decreased by 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 337.2 billion Macau Pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: 4519 billion yen).

Due to the influence of the new coronavirus, the annual "Yuwaku Bonbori Festival" has been canceled at Yuwaku Onsen, and from August 1st, efforts to send messages of support to medical workers will begin.
The paper is piled up by about three hundred and fifty pieces of paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country, and the city of hot water is enveloped with the light of a cheer, and the healing is delivered to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanabuki Iroha" modeled on Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It began in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, and every year, many anime fans from all over the country visit.
Every year from the lighting ceremony in July to October of the main festival, the lanterns are raised on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to Soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be canceled due to the new corona, but local and nationwide fans said, "It is lonely that there is no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku", and the association proposed this plan.
In order to help the healing and recovery of the world, which is in trouble due to the corona disaster, we named it "recovery campaign".
So far, about fifty students from local Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara have written a message with illustrations, and more than a hundred applications have been received from all over the country.
The message form can be purchased from the website of the association, fill it out, put it in a reply envelope, and send it to the association, and you can receive a photo with a light attached to the bonbori.
For one set of six thousand yen, applications will be accepted until all of the three hundred and fifty bonbori are reached.
The lights are scheduled to last until the end of November.
Shinichiro Yamashita, 48, who has been the executive chairman of the festival since the first time, said, "We are encouraged by reading the message. We want to hold the 10th anniversary festival next year."
For the campaign, we also prepared illustrations of the blooming Iroha character and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge.
From the first day, we will give a clear file with illustrations to the user of the special accommodation plan user of the ryokan of Yuwaku Onsen.

In the game against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, they showed their tensisty to victory nine times, and four people who are still far from the same way showed their obsession for victory.
The leading, Genda, came out on base with a head-sliding from the safety bunt to first base.

Yamakawa, the fourth, was shunned, and from that day, Sotozaki, who had returned to 5th place with Mori, smashed Masuda's straight ball and led to a 3-2 victory.
The hero Sotozaki said, “I was surprised even at the bench, and I thought I had to do something. I felt that Tomoya was also able to believe in me behind the bunt and connect with me. Mr. Yamakawa gave me a word of “Be proactive!” before going to first base, and I was able to enter my feelings with a lot of feelings.”
The first- and second-placed draft picks in the 13th year, Mori, Yamakawa, Tosozaki, who was third in the 14th year, and Genda, who was third in the 16th year, were the four players of the baseball team's "core four" of the fielder who called "the heart of our current home".
He has been a captain in both amateur days, and his sense of responsibility is more than twice that of others.
Sotozaki, who took over the captain from Yamakawa when he was in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa-san is good at talking, so he leads the team with words. On the contrary, I was a bad-mouthed vice-captain who was good at speaking, and I was the type who was standing behind."
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But I thought, "I can go. My friend was also a wonderful bunt. Sotozaki hit me well" The cooperation of the soul of "Moriyama Outer Source".
All four are currently suffering from a batting average of two-fourths to five minutes, but they support the team with the wisdom of winning even if they can't hit.

Neymar's final point is Santetienne The goal of Neymar in the first half was the final point, and PSG, who achieved the domestic double crown following League One, are in a situation where they have to be concerned about the Champions League in August.
Kylian Mbappe, who started in the same game, was injured in a vicious sliding tackle by his opponent CB Leuk Pelan.
In the first half hour, the French young star, who had been knocked down in the form of a pinching of his right ankle, distorted his face with pain.
The players of both teams fought over this play.
Mbappe, who appears to have twisted his right ankle, is unable to continue playing.
A red card was awarded to Peran.
After the game, Mbappe, who had his right foot fixed, left the stadium with crutches on.
PSG will play the Coup Dou La League final against Lyon on August 1st, but it would definitely be impossible to use Mbape in this match.
We have to wait for a medical report to be released by the club, but we could also miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Online Museum of Art "HASARD" launched by Mr. Konno (from Hachinohe) (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can experience art for free whenever they want.
There are a wide range of artists, from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April, the online museum "HASARD" has won the hearts of users from its convenience and newness, and the new way of life due to the corona disaster has further increased the level of attention.
Shinnosuke Konno, a 26-year-old representative from Hachinohe City who launched the site, said, "I wanted to create a service that everyone can easily enjoy art. I want people to experience art under difficult circumstances."
When you visit Azaa, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of fourteen exhibitions of permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions have been released, attracting people to see ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only color but also the texture of the brush.
There is no need to register as a member or an entrance fee, and it is characterized by the fact that not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to open the solo exhibition costs nothing.
The unique way of showing online also attracts attention.
Moving a painting is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Begins Again", clouds, flowers, and grasslands are digitally processed to move.
From the thought of "I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter" (Representative Konno), you can enjoy the feeling of being in a picture.
I met art with Konno representative when I was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge pictures of Marc Chagall's "Aleco" and was shocked by the power.
From the next day, art classes changed to a pleasant time, and after entering university, he began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that many people did not have the opportunity to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there are no museums nearby, large exhibitions are held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
Therefore, while working at an IT-related company, he spent about two months launching a site where he could appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of ten thousand per month in the first ten months, and after the spread of the new coronavirus infection, it increased to about thirty thousand.
If you can appreciate art in a free way when you want to see it.
Aza's aim was undeniably accepted by more people due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr. Konno emphasized that it enriches the imagination of the significance of art appreciation.
“When you’re rich in your imagination, you’re going to be able to reach out to people in need.
I want art to become a better society by becoming closer to us.”
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (modern business) - Yahoo! News
Shifting values in the pandemic
There is a lot of discussion and discussion about the after-pandemic world.
On the business side, the July 8th article “In fact, the work of “management” is now beginning to disappear in Japan ...! The cruel reality”, the article of July 4th “In the world of “post-corona”, in fact, “Japanese manufacturing” is likely to be revived ... There is a possibility that the changes mentioned will occur.
[Photo] The true identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people do not know ... The unexpected reality seen in Asia
Also, in terms of spirit, the June 26th article “The knowledge of complete combustion to give to people who have become aware of the end of life with corona” on June 10th, the article of June 10th, “Corona, let’s review the utility of ‘God’ in times of distress’” is now full of riots” It seems that the mainstream trend will become mainstream.
And what seems to be clearly visible to our eyes as a form of the combined two "materials (economics and business)" and "spirit" is a major flow of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality".
For example, it is infuriating if there is a defect or defect in a T-shirt or digital camera, but the life of the person who bought it has no other rule.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of Chinese masks and ventilators that have recently become a hot topic ... ... "China quality" with products directly connected to such life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can’t buy such products.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will be looking for "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not only happening in Japan.
It is also clear that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to the shortage of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another because of the terribleness of "Chinese quality".
Safer and more secure than safety
In addition, products such as automobiles can be fatal (death by accident).
No matter how many countries, including China and South Korea, go on the offensive with the discount strategy of "leash or bad", it will not be able to compete with Japanese products in the end, and the situation that the world's automobile manufacturers will bow down to Toyota after all in the article on June 16th is because "Japan quality" is strongly required for automobiles.
And this pandemic has reminded us that many other products also need to be “safe and secure.”
In addition, safety and security are important not only in "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japanese quality in logistics and other services".
Like toilet paper riots, there are times when the production capacity is properly, but the intermediate distribution is delayed and it may not be reached.
Furthermore, like the article "Who is the real culprit of the mask shortage! Don't allow the fire place thief of the Chinese Communist Party government" on April 17th, self-sufficiency in Japan is also keenly aware that it is an important element of "safety and security".
In an emergency, it is commonplace for every country to take precedence, and it is very important to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food in your own country.
South Korea's new coronavirus cases surpass 100 for the first time in 115 days = the highest number of overseas inflows to 86 (Yonhap News) - Yahoo! News
NEW YORK (Reuters) - South Korea's central anti-epidemic task force said on Tuesday that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus had increased from 113 as of midnight on the previous day, bringing the total number to 14092.

Nagoya · Miyahara player corona positive soccer J1, the first after the league resumption|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
Nagoya, a member of soccer's J1, announced on the 25th that DF Kazuya Miyahara (24) has tested positive for the new coronavirus.
After the resumption of the J-League, the players tested positive for the first time this time.
He is the third player of the club, following FW Yumeo Kanesaki (31), who was infected in June, and GK Mitchell Langerak (31) from Australia.
Both have already been treated and returned to the game.
Miyahara was benched on the 22nd of this season in the game against J1 in Oita at the Showa Denko Dome Oita.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th and revealed that it had conducted a PCR test on the same day against sixty players and staff members.

It turns out that white paint derived from Teflon processed frying pan and insulation will increase the cooling effect!
What a great discovery!
This year was the rainy season, which was not unusually high in the rainy season, but if it is bright, the summer of extreme heat will be in full swing.
It's hot and hot, and even the cold is so hot that it works... just imagine it, it seems to be over, isn't it?
Global warming is a global problem, and humanity has been working hard to understand how to overcome hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear white clothes.
You don't have to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And it seems that the number of cases where white paint is used by applying the same principle to the architecture of the house is increasing.
Even if white is white, it is not possible to use a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat, which is the latest research field.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers at Columbia University’s Department of Applied Physics and Applied Numerology, has found the most efficient way to recover solar heat and improve the cooling effect inside the building.
It is expected that it will be put into practical use early.
Until now, white paint with the highest reflectivity of sunlight has been made using titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paint, which already uses titanium oxide, is applied to the roof of a building in a high-temperature environment, etc., to block the solar heat and improve the cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white paint is derived from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluorine resin, which is used in such tephron processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect, and it is possible to significantly cut the heat by reflecting the sunlight rays up to 98%.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the heat.
Maybe those days are coming up close, right?
I feel that the roof of a Japanese house has a lot of dark colors, but from now on, white system will become mainstream.
When is Amazon’s annual sale going to be held this year?
Amazon.com Inc. has announced the postponement of its annual prime day sale, CNBC reported on July 21st.
It is held every July, but it was reported that it was forced to be postponed this year due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
A spokesperson said: “Details will be announced soon,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
“Prime Day has become a special celebration that we have been looking forward to in the past five years. This year we will be holding it at a later time than usual, ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and our exhibitors.”
However, he said, “Details will be announced soon,” and did not disclose the specific date.
On the other hand, we decided to hold a meeting in India.
Press release posted on the country's website.
He explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6th.
Prime Day has been held at the same time around the world, but this year it may take unusual measures.
Amazon has launched a large-scale sale for its members as a measure to promote sales in the summer when sales decline.
It was initially a 24-hour event, but it has grown in size year by year, and last year it was held in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, Australia, etc., from midnight on July 15th to 48 hours.
According to the company, sales for the past two days exceeded previous sales results on Black Friday (the first day of the year-end sales) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
This event also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers of paid members "Prime", and last year the number of applications on the first day was the highest on record as the number of days, and the next day was also the same number.
Last year, it sold 175 million products worldwide.
Internet Retailer, a specialist magazine in the online shopping industry, reported that global sales over the two days increased by seventy percent year-on-year to $716m.
Mobile number transfer, excessive restraint, severe eyes.
What about fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in full swing considering the review of the same number transition system (MNP), which can use the conventional phone number as it is when changing mobile communication companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, he indicated a policy to revise the guidelines of the MNP, which was established in 2004.
Specific issues include the nature of MNP fees and the pros and cons of retiring those who wish to move out.
While a backlash from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be focused on whether it can lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
The darkness of the communication companies that are far from changing mobile phones The user-pay fee was 2000yen at the beginning of the 6th year when MNP was introduced, but now it is 3000yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated to be JPY159 billion per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the Working Group (WG) on the verification of competition rules, a panel of experts on the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
The number of MNP reservation numbers that consumers need to move to other telecommunications companies is also included in the time.
Major telecommunications companies are accepting applications on the web, but due to the convenience of operating the core system, the acceptance time is mainstream from 9th to 20th.
The WG materials clearly state that the principle of full-day response will be the direction of future consideration.
It is also a problem for mobile communication companies to keep points from people who wish to move out of MNP.
Excessive restraints can hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner of Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of the WG, recommends that "you will receive time to explain the provision of economic benefits, or you will have permission from the user to issue a number promptly to the user who does not have permission and terminate it. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, in a series of issues, the structural problem of MNP fees lies with the person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (the person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) that the motivation to actively lower the MNP fee, because the higher the number of customers, the harder it is to leak out.
If there are businesses that take the initiative to lower MNP fees, there is concern that the outflow of customers from the company will increase, and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not ask for user-paying fees for MNPs, and it is possible that this will be the case in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications would like to compile the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then start the procedure for the revision of the MNP guidelines.
The timing of the amendment is expected to be after the 21st year.
Mobile telecommunications companies are likely to be scratching their heads, including sales and customer support.
Chunichi, Katsuno, six unbeaten points, but the right of the winning pitcher is not obtained (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Nakanichi and Masayoshi Katsuno (23) started in the 8th round of the Hanshin 8th round (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He struck out six in four innings.
“I thought it was the last chance because there was a previous board, so I threw it. There was also a foreball, but I was able to compete with the opponent without worrying too much.”
This season's first pitch and the last 18th Hanshin game (Koshien), both started by two times and suffered the control ball and dropped up to four times.
It was a backwater mound that did not fulfill the role of a starter, and this time it was a backwater mound facing for the survival of one army.
This time, he attacked with a strong bullish ball against a strong fierce tiger line opponent.
When the straight ball of the second half of the 140km unit ran, the change ball such as the count ball was also able to be used effectively.
In the sixth inning, he hit a two-run homer to the Suns in the middle of the left, but he struck out Oyama to left and Boa to two innings, and at second base.
In the match against Fukudome, which I welcomed here, I was driven in with two balls, and at the end I forked.
In the three-ball game, he took away the three-strike swing and overcame the pinch.
Katsuno finished six innings with 83 pitches, but at the end of the midfield game, Yoda left the bench and announced the change of pitchers.
Nishiyu, who played a pitching game, was 108th at the same time, but he was able to get off the mound first and not get the right to win for the first time this season.

R Socks and Betts have a lot of talent!
You can do this outside of baseball!
Betts made his majors debut in 2014, aged 21.
He has contributed to the team as the center of the Boston Red Sox's strong hitting line and as a strong right-hander.
From 2015 until last season, he recorded more than 40 second-base hits every year, like the pinnacle of middle-distance batters.

Mr. Akio Kinoshita, Director of the ophthalmology department of Hiramatsu Hospital, explained the dry eye etc. "Hot Seminar" = Yonezawa Saga Main Store of glasses in Saga City
On the 25th, a "Health Hot Seminar" (sponsored by Saga Shimbun Co-sponsored by Yonezawa of Glasses) was held at the Yonezawa Saga Main Store in Shimoda-cho, Saga City, where experts advise on various health-related problems.
Dr. Akio Kinoshita, Director of the ophthalmology Department at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained the diseases of the eyes that are deeply related to daily life, such as dry eye and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "sickness of tears", and the quality of tears is broken, and the sickness that tears do not spread evenly on the surface of the eyes.
“Contact lens users are about four times more likely,” Kinoshita said, “and be careful not to use it for a long time or sleep while wearing it.”
It showed measures such as placing the computer screen below the height of the eye and humidifying in the room where the air conditioner worked.
We also introduced ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eye.
"The omega-3s contained in blue fish prevent the evaporation of tears, and the 'mucin' that is found in a lot of natto and okra enhances the quality of tears," he said.
For cataract surgery, there was a single-focal and multi-focal lens inserted instead of a lens, and it touched on the difference in appearance.
About forty people participated in the seminar.
As a measure to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection, it was opened in two parts, morning and afternoon, and the temperature was measured and disinfected before entering, and sufficient ventilation was carried out.

I didn't give him the opportunity to participate, but in J3 so far, he has scored three goals in five games this season and has a result, "There is a prominent part of taking points. I'm seventeen years old, but I want you to do more Gamshala. I've seen players who go abroad young, but I want them to play with a high sense of consciousness and greed."
Karayama scored eight goals in ten games for J3, who competed as a special designated player last season.
He is 178cm and 65kg, but with his sense of taking the back of the defender with instant movement, and his coolness until the shot he shows in front of the dense opponent's goal, J3 boasts a staggering score rate of 11goals in 15 games.
In the Hiroshima match, FW Ademiuson and MF Onose were off the bench due to injury, and Tangshan got a chance, but there was no opportunity to participate.
In preparation for the match against Kobe, Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiuson and Onose, "Both of them are not one hundred percent, but they are motivated and take on the challenge of preparation."
If he saves the two, there is a possibility that he will be benched in Tangshan again.
In G Osaka, MF Doan = current PSV = was sixteen years and eleven months, and FW Usami made his J1 debut at the age of seventeen years and zero months, and moved to overseas as a teenager.
Tangshan, who is currently seventeen years and ten months old, is expected to make his J1 debut as a presence that follows them.
Twenty-six years ago, a Ferrari stolen at the bottom of the river is found │ No restoration to the work (octane.jp) - Yahoo! News
In 1994, there was an incident in which a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
The police had not been able to solve the problem, but after twenty-six years, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (four photos) The discovery was triggered by the diving training of the fire department.
On July 8th, a training diver discovered something of a wedge shape that sank at the bottom of the river, and the police and the Dutch army went out, and when they pulled something up, it was a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number with the stolen car database, it was possible to associate this Ferrari with the 1994 incident.
The car is handed over to its legal owner, the insurance company, and then sent to scrap dealers.
The scrapper, Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, said, “There are still some remaining parts, but it’s for the art of decorating. We’ve already received a lot of requests from people who want to make tables from the dismembered mondial. We use engine blocks and glass plates.”
For the time being, we have not considered specific sales, and scrap dealers will store it as an object-like existence.
Seibu and Sotozaki say goodbye for the first time
The 6th year of the professional "man who does not have" is finally!
(Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Pa League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu six wins and three losses, 24th, MetLife) It is a white star of obsession! !
Seibu's Sotozaki Shutaiuchi, a 27-year-old infielder, gave up his first goodbye in the second inning of the Lotte 9th round (MetLife) on the 24th and his sixth year as a pro in the left front, contributing to a 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunity that was directed by Genda's head sliding and the forest's slashing.
The team that competed and won the team had two savings.
The voltage of the Leo Party, which was packed at the home of the MetLife Dome, reached its time.
Sotozaki's first goodbye in his sixth year as a professional.
It roused a crowd of 4825 people.
"Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected me, so I entered the batting session with the intention of doing something."
He was 2-2 in nine innings.
The leading hitter, Genda, tried a safety bunt and slid a slidhead at first base.
When he came out to base with an infield hit, last season's leading hitter Mori decided to hit the professional's second.
The fourth mountain is far from the declaration.
A senior at Fuji University was walking, and the inside of Sotozaki was burning.
“I thought, ‘Fuck’. Mr. Yamakawa said, ‘Be proactive’ before going to first base, so I felt a lot.”
From one ball, he was clogged with a straight ball with a high inner angle, but the ball fell in front of his left side.
Say goodbye to "I don't have a memory" throughout my amateur days.
The 27-year-old, whose alma mater, Aomori and Hirosaki Sanetaka, advanced to the prefecture's four-strong tournament in the summer for the first time in twenty years, and was also stimulated, took a shower of joy and smiled, "It felt good, as expected."
He was called “The Man Who Didn’t Have.”
He was selected as a Samurai Japan as a versatile player who can protect the infield and the inside, and contributed to the world's best at the "Premier12" last November.
However, he had no experience of saying goodbye in Seibu, and he was teased by manager Tsuji and the manager of Baba's strategy, defense, and base coach, "I don't have it, you."
He rebounded a negative reputation and produced a goodbye victory for the second time this season.
Director Tsuji said, "I asked the goddess of victory if I asked for it only today. She hit me well."
In savings2, it is the third place of the gap between the first and the first game, Softbank.
Sotozaki, who has only one home run this season and has a batting average of 252, said, "I have to hit more. I will work as a team to aim for the next one win."
Let's make a shot that decided the game, and it will be a trigger for the recovery.

Progress toward branded pigs Minoru pig, acquired JGAP (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Minoru Pork Co., Ltd., which breeds about fifty thousand pigs a year at farms in Towada City and Rokunohe Town, visited Mayor Hisashi Oyamada at Towada City Hall on the 20th and reported that his farm had acquired the "JGAP (livestock and livestock products) certification" certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second case of a pig farmer in the prefecture.
The company is engaged in the production of garlic pork, which uses powder from the prefecture's garlic, and "jita-gyo" (local pig) that uses prefectural rice as a special feed.
This time, out of the five farms, about ten thousand were raised and JGAP certification was obtained at the fifth farm (Rokunohe-cho), which produces "local pig".
The company decided to acquire the certification because it knew that it was a condition for the procurement of ingredients used in the Olympic Village at the Tokyo Olympics, thinking that it was necessary to obtain certification by major buyers.
Since last August, with the support of the Aomori Bank, we have been preparing with a member of the bank who is qualified as a JGAP instructor.
On March 3rd of this year, it was examined by the certification body, and it cleared a total of 113 items such as food safety.
It was certified on the 13th of the same month.
The visit was attended by Mr. Minoru Nakano, President of the company, Mr. Watari Nakano, Mr. Watari Nakano, Managing Director of the company, Mr. Takeo Yamada of the Aomori Bank, Mr. Minami Towada, General Manager of the Minami Branch of the Aomori Bank, and Mr. Yoshihiro Ishigo, Business Advisor of the Bank Corporate Support Department.
Mayor Oyamada said, "It's very wonderful. I hope that you will do a lot of PR (JGAP certification) and lead to the expansion of sales channels."
Mr. Minoru Nakano, the representative of Toshimashi Nakano, said, "I would like to continue to contribute to Towada City by making efforts to brand pig farming."
"We will aim to obtain certification at the remaining four farms," said Mr. Nakano, managing director of Todai Nakano, "and he will aim to obtain certification at the remaining four farms."

(Se League, Chunichi 1-0 Hanshin, 8th round, four wins and four losses, 25th, Nagoya D) Chunichi Takahashi Shuhei (26), who was out of the front line with a left thigh behind the back, appeared on the 25th in the Hanshin 8th game in the seventh inning with a two-run homer.
The result was two-fold.

The result was two rumblings after leaving the bat to the slider of Isamu Nishi's first ball, but it became two deaths and third base with a minimum work, and Iryo followed with a pre-emptive infield hit.
"It is ideal to hit a hit, but I'm glad that Mr. Iryo hit me and got a point."
It was originally expected to take three to four weeks to return, but it was a two-week speed return.
Director Yoda also said, “I think it’s about 70 to 80 percent. This is my sense, so I’m like that in the part I’m looking at, but I think it’s enough, a faster recovery than expected. I didn’t particularly care about how to run after hitting, and I think that if I gradually get used to it, I’ll get closer to the starters.”
Takahashi himself decided, "I will get back the amount I was leaving as soon as possible."
A reliable captain pushes the team up.
Heavy rain, scars on "traffic" in Kitato National Road 152nd 10km road closed, part of JR Iida Line section is closed|Shizuoka Shimbun Ats. Co., Ltd.
The 152nd National Route has been completely closed, and a line of cars waiting for the passage of a detour of one side alternating traffic = 22nd afternoon, Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu Ward, Hamamatsu City (part of the photo is processed)
The Tenryu area in Hamamatsu City was heavily damaged in Shizuoka Prefecture due to heavy rains in July that caused severe damage in various parts of Japan, including Kyushu.
The effects of landslides remain on the 152nd National Road of the main road and the JR Iida Line on the "foot of life", and many places require time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are becoming more worried about the negative impact on economic activities.
At Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in Ryuyama-cho, the same ward, a long-awaited convoy of cars continues during the day.
The first car stopped for about forty minutes.
The 152nd National Route is closed for about 10km, and it is necessary to take a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River to move around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, all sections are one-sided alternating traffic, and the waiting time is unpredictable.
In the same town, a landslide occurred on the national road on the 9th, and the road was closed because there was a risk of falling rocks on the slope of the vicinity.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba Tunnel in the regulated section, and the timing of the reopening of traffic has not yet stood.
In the same town, the national road was closed due to the collapse of the soil, and it was a blow to the lives of residents and tourism.
Kimie Tamamoto, 76, a representative of the Dragon Mama processing plant that sells specialty products, said, "With the new coronavirus, customers are far away. Visitors are greatly reduced."
The JR Iida Line was closed between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, the same ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to the slope collapse beside the railway.
Mr. Ukai, 16, who attended Hamamatsuko Kita-Takasakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, the same ward, from Oarashi Station (the same town) in the section of the service, needed a one-hour car pick-up and drop-off one-way train.
"If it is a car, parents and themselves are burdensome" I hope for an early recovery.
According to JR Tokai, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and from the 27th, a special train will be operated between Sukubo Station and Oarashi Station one by one in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides have occurred frequently on forest roads, which are also living roads.
There are also cases where it takes several hours to detour.
Keiji Kumagai, 69, head of the Mizukubo Forest Association, said, "The removal of raw wood is also stagnant. There are isolated islands on the land everywhere. I am worried about the future rain."
Is the absence of the winner of the championship ceremony your own choice?
Local Media Report (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
Japanese midfielder Shoya Nakajima is on his way to leaving Porto.
Portugal's "ZAP" reported based on information from "Lecordo".
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019/20 season, held the championship ceremony on the pitch during the final game of their home game on the 20th of this month.
However, it was a topic that Nakajima was not there in this place.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team during the league's suspension due to the new coronavirus, has been missing since then.
In such a situation, he was absent from the championship ceremony, so this summer's transfer has been discussed.
According to "Lecordo", Porto invited Nakajima to this ceremony.
It was just that Nakajima didn't show up.
For this reason, “Nakajima is increasingly out of the plan for next season of Sergio Conseyson, and he needs to leave the club in the next transfer market.”
Nakajima, who was the 10th in Portugal's prestigious family, seems to be leaving in a year.

A horizontal rainbow-colored ring horizontal arc appeared at the same time under the sun above the sun = 24th 8:43am, near Takado, Yamagata City
A phenomenon that seems to be a horizontal arc of the ring of the rainbow-colored band of light and the sun-like ring of light that surrounds the sun appeared at the same time in Yamagata City just before 9am on the 24th.
According to the Yamagata Regional Meteorological Observatory, both the sun and the ring horizontal arc are caused by the refraction and reflection of sunlight on the fine ice crystals in the clouds.
Ordinary rainbows are seen in the opposite direction of the sun, while the ring horizontal arc is characterized by its appearance in the same direction as the sun.
The sun is a relatively common phenomenon, but the horizontal arc does not appear as often as the sun.

Forty-five percent of the families where my wife holds my wallet!
Is your husband happy or unhappy?
"This month's pocket money is not enough ...", my husband told me, or there is a wife who is angry?
The family that makes up this conversation is the family where the wife holds the wallet.
How many families do you have in your wallet?
Also, let’s take a look at the percentage of “couple wallets” and “jointly managed”.
Which of the following is in your household wallet?
The following survey results are obtained from the results of the “Survey on the Household Management of Couples” (announced in June of the 2nd year of Reiwa) conducted by Matsui Securities Co., Ltd., which surveyed a total of eight hundred people, including four hundred men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples), more than 30 years of marriage (a mature couple), and a total of 800 people.
Do you hold your household wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The most common result was the family where the wife manages the household budget.
No matter which one you manage, it is household management that has many twists and turns, but it seems that there are various episodes.
My wife manages the household: Ako-san A-ko is a warma of Arafif who has a daughter in the third year of high school and a daughter in the first year of high school.
A.M. is in full control of the household budget.
In preparation for the university entrance exam, the cram school fee became more and more in the month when the deficit was large, so I negotiated with my husband to lower my pocket money, but I was resisted.
At that time, I was told to show what kind of income it was, so I showed the household book.
I should have listed all the expenses, but when I looked at the household book, it was not enough to be in the red.
My husband almost leaned on me, but Ako-san thought into, "I understand, I'm not strong in household management, so please manage everything" If you cut out Omitai, "Please do it again" It seems that you will be sent back.
Later, when Ako-san interviewed her husband, she said, "I am dissatisfied with the management of pocket money, etc., but I am honest that I do not have the time or energy to manage various household entrances and outsets (for example, school teaching materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages the household budget: In the case of Ms. B, a housewife, Mr. B, is given the living expenses by her husband and manages every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke, so Mr. B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "I can't use the freezer, but I can still use the refrigerated part, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, my husband himself wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time, and his hands turned over, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
So Mr. B said that he complained to his friend, "My husband is so stingy that he is so stingy."
Takehide Kubo's transfer destination was narrowed down to five clubs in the first division of Spain (Higashi Spo Web) - Yahoo! News
It seems that the transfer destination of Japanese national midfielder Takehide Kubo (19), who played for Majorca in Spain, is gradually narrowing down this season.
Mallorca were relegated to the second division, but Kubo's reputation soared due to his success at the end of the season.
However, due to the outside of the EU, it is difficult to return to Real Madrid, which has "ownership rights", and he plans to play for other clubs next season.
We have already received offers from about thirty clubs, but R Madrid will have a warrior training at a domestic club.
The Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis, as Kubo's transfer destination, were influential, "Five clubs are interested in acquiring Kubo, but R Madrid wants a club that is more than the middle of the league."
Villarreal and R Sociedad have qualified for the European League (EL) next season, and Granada will also compete from the second round of the EL qualifying and meet the team conditions required by R Madrid.
What will the world's number one big club decide to leave Japan's "treasure"?

“Everything was going well until the new coronavirus happened, and we were planning to release it in December,” he said, adding that there was a significant delay in the production of the film, adding that he was sad that “I am more disappointed than anyone else in this delay.”
The second Avatar will be released in December 2022, a year ahead, and the third in 2024, the fourth in 2026, and the fifth in 2028.
In addition, the new three-part series of Star Wars will be postponed for a year, and the first film will be released in December 2023, the second will be in 2025, and the third will be in 2027.
The Karamon Gate, which is illuminated by colorful fireworks and light at a nationwide event, on the night of July 24th, the ruins of the Ichijodani Asakura clan in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
On the night of July 24th, one year until the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, which was postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus, a nationwide fireworks event was held by the Japan Youth Chamber (JC) to brighten up society as much as possible.
Unfortunately, it was raining in Fukui Prefecture, but it was launched as scheduled at nine places, coloring the summer night sky.
Overcoming the sense of blockage caused by the spread of infection, JC called each block council nationwide to realize it, hoping that Japan would be a signal to be reborn.
It started at 8pm at 117 locations in 46 prefectures.
At the Ichijodani Asakura clan ruins in Fukui City, a total of 53 shots of 2 to 4 balls were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with moans.
The light of the fireworks brought up the Karamon Gate in the dark night, and it became a fantastic atmosphere.
In the prefecture, it was also held along the Matsubara Coast in Tsuruga City and the Mana River in Ono City.
In order to prevent infection, we did not pre-announce the launch site, hoping to avoid the gathering of many onlookers.
