Rabies cases increase in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Tawichai of the Ninth Office of Disease Control and Prevention said on February 9 that rabies infections have been increasing in northeastern Thailand in recent months, with a total of 74 cases.
So far this fiscal year (October last year to September this year), a total of 74 people have tested positive for rabies, 67 in Surin and Buriram districts in the northeast, and 7 respectively.
All of them have been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
He urged people to get the rabies vaccine with their pets and not to touch the saliva of animals suspected of being infected.
Rabies is transmitted to humans not only from dogs, but also from cats and bats.
Almost 100% of people die when they become infected and develop symptoms, but death can be prevented by vaccinating people before they develop symptoms.

FUJI System development to prevent accidents left behindExperiment with its own vehicles|Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information of Aichi, Gifu, Mie, Shizuoka
FUJI (headquartered in Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells robots and machine tools for mounting electronic components, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent children from being left behind in vehicles.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with a pick-up vehicle at our own facility.
While tragic accidents occur due to abandonment, we will protect the safety of children.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with two pick-up and drop-off vehicles of "teracoya THANK," an English conversation after-school for children operated by the company in Chiryu City.
Motion sensors that detect the movement of people based on the temperature difference between people and the surroundings are installed in three places on the ceiling of the car.
When a vehicle is turned off and the doors are closed, a warning notification is automatically sent when a movement of a person is detected after a certain period of time.
By linking information with the status of the engine and doors, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling the pre-registered number, it will be displayed in the chat on your computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care is taken to prevent mistakes such as oversight.
The demonstration experiment will continue until the end of February.
Ikko Kamiya, manager of Section 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out that "during the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system became apparent."
For example, he was able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"I hope we can expand our solutions," he said.
The impetus for the development of the system to prevent abandonment was a series of accidents involving shuttle buses being left behind nationwide.
An employee with a young child suggested that there was anything that could be done to protect the safety of children.
We decided to develop the product in order to make use of the know-how cultivated through FA (Factory Automation)-related businesses, such as information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors.
FUJI's anti-abandonment system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed by simply pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to pick-up and drop-off vehicles, the hurdle to introduction will be lowered and the company aims to spread the system.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka, which was scheduled for the beginning of FY2023, has been postponed, and the development of the city west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture is beginning to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station will be installed, the detailed location of the station is still not indicated, and urban planning, including the development of the surrounding area, is at a standstill.
It is expected that it will take a long time to formulate the plan, and it is necessary to make it public as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned for Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Development Agency indicated the approximate location of the station as a radius of about 2.5 kilometers centered on JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The detailed location of the station and the confirmation of the route were aimed at the winter of '22.
In Obama City, the business related to the Shinkansen in anticipation of the opening of Tsuruga and the opening of Obama in the future will be in full swing in FY21.
In the initial budget for FY22, the number of projects will be further increased, and the location of the new station will be announced.
However, the exact location of the new station has not yet been announced.
The city has allocated 3 million yen in this year's budget as a project to consider land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station and formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that it will not be implemented.
Urban planning centered on the new station "takes time to build a consensus among citizens," said a city official.
There is an example of Echizen City as a newly built suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it can be seen that it will take a considerable amount of time to put together an overall concept.
There are concerns that the longer the announcement is delayed, the shorter the preparation period for the opening, which will affect the development of the surrounding area.
Prior to the location of the new station, there is a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a group of citizens in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the withdrawal of the extension plan.
In the Ishikawa prefectural political circles, there have been a series of moves to return to the drawing board, such as the postponement of the start of construction and the reconsideration of the Yonehara route, and it is difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is monolithic.
Obama's reaction to the postponement of the start of construction is relatively calm, but there are concerns that the location of the new station is unknown and the opening date remains unclear, which may affect the momentum in the future.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue his campaign to request the government for the early opening of the entire line, but it will be essential to hear the voices of the communities along the line calling for the start of construction as soon as possible.
The indifference that "the Shinkansen will pass through (west of Tsuruga) someday" will not move the national government and neighboring prefectures.
I want the enthusiasm to keep speaking up.
Chocolate section for Valentine's Day where tasting has been revived for the first time in 3 years = February 9, Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
Ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14, while the price of chocolate in stores has risen due to the soaring cost of raw materials and packaging materials, sales of high-priced chocolates for oneself and family and friends are brisk.
Retail stores and confectionery stores in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that emphasize local flavors, luxury, and commitment to ingredients.
The Seibu Fukui store (Fukui City) opened a special sales floor on the 6th floor of the event hall on January 25.
Until the 14th, about 450 types of confectionery from about 40 brands, including 10 confectionery stores in the prefecture, are on sale.
Chocolates made with local sake from Fukui and sandwiches with raw chocolate sandwiched between cookies are popular.
According to the person in charge of the store, the in-store price of many products has increased by about 10% compared to the previous year.
Regarding this year's trends, he said, "There are many products that are characterized by sticking to ingredients and giving a sense of luxury in the packaging, and there is a tendency among consumers to buy for themselves and their families and enjoy comparing them."
Even amid the headwinds of price hikes, sales in the high-price range are brisk.
⇒ An average increase of 25 yen per grain due to the impact of high prices
"We try to create a sales floor where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself," said the person in charge.
The store has been selling daily recommended sweets since January 26, and has resumed tasting for the first time in three years.
At the end of last year, Western confectionery manufacturer and distributor Nishi Confectionery Club (headquartered in Ippontanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City) introduced a series of original chocolates "KISEKI" jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate manufacturer for the first time during the Valentine's Day sales season.
It is particular about cacao beans and is characterized by a fruity taste with less bitterness, and is sold for 1,000 yen for 3 pieces and 3,000 yen for 9 pieces.
Ryoma Takakura, director and general manager of the company's purchasing department, says, "While the culture of in-law chocolate is gradually fading, there is still a demand for people to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day.

A female office worker in her 20s (Fukui City) who visited the Seibu Fukui store on the 9th said, "I've always loved chocolate, so now that I can get a job and get paid, I want to buy it as a reward for myself."
A female office worker in her 30s who bought the chocolates said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolates, but since it is once a year, I would like to give it to my family and people who usually take care of me.
Products using Fukui plums and midi tomatoes from Fukui Prefecture = February 9, Fukui Prefectural Office
Seven-Eleven Japan announced on February 9 that it will sell six products, including new products made with Fukui Prefecture ingredients such as sweet shrimp, at 339 stores in the three Hokuriku prefectures from the same day.
As a commemorative project to commemorate the first anniversary of the conclusion of a comprehensive partnership agreement on all aspects of prefectural government, we will appeal the attractiveness of prefectural products.
In addition to four new products: shrimp miso ramen and tsumire soup made with sweet shrimp caught in the prefecture, salad made with prefectural midi tomatoes, and cream puffs with double mochi and bean paste, the company also offers rice balls from Fukui plums and a sauce cutlet bowl.

The person in charge of the company said, "We would like to continue to develop products using products from Fukui Prefecture in the future."
The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle with Heisenji = Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
There was once a large-scale Ushigahara manor in the Inuikawa district of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture.
In order to prepare for the battle with Heisenji Temple, which was at odds with the manor during the Kamakura period, Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built on the side of Nabetoko Mountain in the district.
It appears in the military story "Taiheiki".
There are no surviving materials about Ushigahara Castle, but the following is written in the "Echizen Ushihara Jitou Suicide Incident" in the 11th volume of the Taiheiki.
Awakawa Ukyo Ryo Tokiharu, an official of the Kamakura shogunate, was sent to Ono as the head of the land.
In 1333, the Rokuhara Expedition, which had been set up in Kyoto to monitor the imperial court and control the western country, was overthrown by Ashikaga Takashi, and the Kamakura shogunate was overthrown by Nitta Yoshisada.
When Tokiharu's servants heard the news that the Rokuhara Quest had perished, they immediately fled, leaving only about 20 people.
Taking advantage of the gap, the monks of Heisenji Temple attacked.
Tokiharu took his wife and two children into the river and followed him to suicide.
⇒ impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu came together
In 2014, the "Association for the Improvement of the Dry Side," which is made up of local residents, published "The History of the Dry Side."
The tragic story of Tokiharu is introduced in a manga so that even elementary school students can easily understand it.
Masao Kitagawa (75), who was involved in the publication, said, "I want people in the community to know about the history that is familiar to them and pass it on to future generations."

The ruins of the castle can be reached by a mountain trail maintained by the Association for the Improvement of the Dry Side.
It is about 200 meters from the trailhead.
The road leading to the trailhead may not be accessible for cars due to snow in winter.
Meeting to improve the dry side
A total of about 220 households in the Inui side area of Ono City have joined.
In the past, we have published "Torisetsu on the Inui Side," which introduces ancient burial mounds, historical sites, and attractions in the district.
The roadside station "Rennyo no Sato Awara" under maintenance in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture will open on April 22nd.
In anticipation of the opening of Ashihara Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen in the spring of 2024, it is expected to attract approximately 360,000 users per year as a new regional development and tourism base in the northern part of the city.
The station's main dining and merchandise facilities are one-story steel-framed buildings with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The entire site area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and the Nagisa Children's Park, is 8,137 square meters.
The facility will also have a rest area and a tourist information center.
Electric bicycles can be rented, and there is also a shower room.
The two parking lots can accommodate a total of 66 small and large vehicles (including three for the disabled).
The city's mayor, Notsugu Morinotsugu, made the announcement at a regular press conference held on February 8.
At the food and beverage corner, parfaits made with fruits from the northern hills of Sakai and pies such as Mitsu Kintoki are sold.
We are working on the development of menus that use plenty of local products, such as egg-covered rice using Fukuji chicken and autumn/winter-only dishes using eels from Hokugata.
Currently, about 60 businesses are members of the "Shipper Council" of direct sales offices.
The company will also enhance its lineup of processed products such as bento boxes and side dishes, as well as agricultural and horticultural products such as seedlings and plants.
In the souvenir corner, in addition to exhibiting and selling works by artists who live in the Kanazu Creative Forest Museum, confectionery, sake, and traditional crafts are handled.

The designated manager of the station is Awa Running LLC (Yoshizaki 2-chome, Awara City), which was established by President Masashi Miyatani, who runs the theme park "Tsuki Usagi no Sato" where you can interact with rabbits in Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture.
At the press conference, Mayor Mori said, "We will restore and promote vitality and vitality throughout Awara City, which will lead to the improvement of the lives of local residents and the revitalization of the region."
A cat-shaped serving robot introduced at the "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store".
Adorable facial expressions are popular with family guests = Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the restaurant industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce food delivery robots that deliver food to customers.
In addition to being useful for labor-saving in store management and "non-contact" customer service to prevent new coronavirus infection, the robot's adorable facial expressions are said to be popular with family customers.
Restaurant owners and related parties have voiced that it is difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and that food delivery robots will become even more popular.
"Jin, Jinn, Genghis Khan ♪".
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face on the screen runs smoothly through the restaurant with food on it.
When he arrives at the customer's table, he says to the customer, "I brought you the food you ordered."
In August 2022, the "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped serving robot.
When a robot waiting near the kitchen places food ordered by a customer and presses the table number on the screen, it autonomously drives to that table and delivers it.
It has a built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function, responds when the customer touches it, and has a rich expression of the cat face on the screen.
The Bonta Group, which operates the restaurant, has introduced food delivery robots at two stores, including the same restaurant.
President Toshiyuki Saito said that "the labor shortage is the biggest factor" and emphasized that it was part of the effort to improve productivity through labor-saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually about 30%, but it has been reduced to 21~22% by introducing the system.
The robot also has the role of collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which leads to more efficient cleanup, and "families and children are happy, and it has a publicity effect," he adds.
The "Rokuma Hoshiyama Fukui Store" of grilled meat and hormone hot pot in Araki Shinbocho, Fukui City, also introduced a serving robot in August 22.
Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Seongsan Shoten, which runs the company, says, "Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, they don't come easily, so we thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
At the Fukui store, the area where employees serve food is separated from the robot delivery range.
The cost of leasing a robot is said to be about the same as the wage of one part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store has adopted an ordering system using tablet terminals in addition to robots, and is considering self-checkouts.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the active job openings-to-applicants ratio by occupation in December 22 was 6.94 times for "customer service services" such as restaurants, which is a job with a high sense of labor shortage.
The person in charge of Net System (Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for the sales of food delivery robots, says, "The labor shortage at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious due to the influence of the Corona disaster, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama said, "It will be even more difficult for suburban stores in rural areas to secure employees in the future, and I think that food delivery robots will become more widespread."
Echizen Town has made an ending note and distributed it to the townspeople who wish to do so.
Two years ago, when the "Okuyami Handbook," which covers the procedures necessary when a relative dies, a write-in inheritance list, and a family tree, many people came to pick it up for themselves.
Lectures on how to write ending notes and pre-mortem arrangements are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and it seems that "end-of-life" has become firmly established among the people of the prefecture.
The ending note of Echizen Town is 35 pages.
In five chapters, the book begins with a review of one's personal history, and describes the current state of health and assets, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can write down what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message for your loved ones.
It can be daunting to write 35 pages, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you most want to write about to your family and the people around you?
The key is to be clear about your purpose.
A variety of notebooks are available on the market at bookstores and other places to suit your purpose, and you can easily start writing from where you can write.
Likening it to job hunting, the term "end-of-life" was coined in 2009.
Two years later, in 11, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly" and that more and more people are preparing for their own end or end of life.
More than 10 years have passed since then.
The new coronavirus pandemic that has struck the world has not yet subsided.
Prices have risen due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and electricity prices have jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current price hikes, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, funeral expenses, nursing care expenses, grave management, etc., which used to be shared by siblings and relatives, are now not uncommon for only children.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, the risk of dementia and the need for long-term care increases as people get older.
It should be borne in mind that the reason why the end of life is not a temporary phenomenon and has become entrenched is partly due to this growing social anxiety.
In any case, we all want to not put an undue burden on our partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword in the ending note, but don't get too complacent.
Rather than secretly writing down your hopes and requests, you should consult with your family at least once and calmly prepare for that time.

At the graduation ceremony, he expressed the idea that it is not necessary for students and faculty to wear masks in principle = February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided that students should "not wear masks" at graduation ceremonies.
The principal of a large junior high school said, "It is actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, and I am worried about how to respond.
In response to the media reports surrounding the wearing of masks at graduation ceremonies, this topic has been raised among teachers.
On the other hand, an elementary school principal predicted, "If the government decides to wear it, it will not be worn, and if it excludes choirs, it will be realistically possible."
At this year's graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to relax measures, such as allowing current students who had refrained from participating and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, prefectural high schools are scheduled to hold ceremonies in early March, and public elementary and junior high schools are scheduled to hold ceremonies in the middle of the same month.
Prefectural boards of education and municipal boards of education will wait for an official notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology to decide how to respond.
In addition, there were cautious voices about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's decision not to require the wearing of masks in all school education activities from the new school year this spring.
The principal of the elementary school said, "Children are confused by the sudden response of not wearing a mask from one day, and it is natural that the number of children who first decide that they are free to wear it and then gradually take it off will increase."
× × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities from April in accordance with the government's new guidelines on wearing masks.
As a general rule, no masks are allowed in choir and physical education classes, as well as club activities.
During the 2022 school year, infection control measures will be required in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and precautions from April onwards will be disseminated to the Board of Education and school sites in the future.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, high schools, and universities will be held during FY22, and graduates, faculty and staff, and participating students will not wear masks after implementing ventilation and other measures.
Yasushi Nagata cutting the examinee (left) with scissors who prayed for passing = Hair Atelier Rim in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
Every year during the exam season, at the beauty salon Hair Atelier Rims in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, students who take exams are cut using scissors and other tools that they pray for passing.
It is said that the students who took the exam have praised it, saying that they have become more confident and that they were able to face the exam calmly.
Yasushi Nagata, the representative director of the beauty salon, has seen and heard students open their textbooks while waiting for their cuts and express their anxiety about taking exams while they are getting cut.
So, in 2014, "if it helps even a little," I started cutting prayers for passing.
⇒ Aggregation of the last day of national and public university applications
Every year, on the first day of work, the beauty salon asks people to pray for the passing of scissors and combs at Kamisosha in Wakatake-cho, the same city.

In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are various employment exams and driver's license tests.

For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the rocky areas of Higashihirobo, Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a suicide spot, to prevent suicides, and we have continued to support suicide attempts until they find and protect suicide attempters until they start again.
This book summarizes the issues we have heard from 784 people (as of February 6) who have been protected so far, and appeals to the Prime Minister for the following seven points regarding the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" are piled up behind suicides.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens living outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with a mental disorder such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "duty of care for safety" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and is driven by commercialism.
(7) The part of the doctrine of an emerging religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening the other party to provide money or goods by telling them of the future is blackmail.
Religious groups that are engaged in this criminal act of "fraud and extortion" should be made public and removed.
Therefore, we have received comments from people who have subscribed to this book, such as "I was impressed by the strong mentality of those who are engaged in this activity," "The appearance of this former police officer is a sign of a police officer," and "He is a living bodhisattva who supports people as if he were his own relatives even though he is such a stranger." Here is a part of my impressions.
When I saw the photo in the newspaper article, I was in tears, thinking, "What are you thinking..."
Now, I hear that suicides among people who have been cornered by the coronavirus pandemic are increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is who they are.
I would like to see a society where people can live their lives with pleasure.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude for the staff who were doing their best to help those who were in so much pain that they wanted to die.
I think that this activity is an activity that overuses both physically and mentally, but please take care of yourself and continue to talk to us.
Thank you.

Kenji Shimada, who photographs capybaras almost every week and posts photos on SNS = February 1, Fukui City, Fukui City, Asuwayama Park Amusement Park, indoor facility "Happyjan"
There is a man in the city who takes weekly photos of capybaras at the indoor facility "Happyjan" at the Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui Prefecture and posts them on Instagram.
The post is lined with a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment when he yawns with his teeth peeking out of his big mouth, or the figure of him lying down and playing in the sun.
He has more than 10,000 followers in Japan and abroad, and has helped many people know the charm of happy and capybara.
⇒ Shizuka Kudo posts traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The man is Kenji Shimada (38), an office worker who lives in the city.
In March 2021, we started disseminating information on social networking sites (SNS).
Capybaras are one of the largest rats in the world, and they are good swimmers with webbed fingers.
Since it opened 18 years ago, Hapijan has bred a total of three animals, one male and two females, and you can observe and feed them up close.
Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
When he saw a video of him relaxing in a hot spring, he was shocked, saying, "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to their charming expressions and gestures, almost like humans.
After that, I heard that it would be bred in Hapidjan, and I was looking forward to seeing it up close.
I started taking photos in earnest about three years ago when I bought a single-lens reflex camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of the capybara, and do not miss the photo opportunity when it shakes its body and cuts the water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has risen to about 830, so much so that he looks back and says, "I often took this many pictures."
Perhaps he remembered Mr. Shimada as he went to school, and the male Yamato approached him and squealed, "Kyuru Kyuru".
"It's cute and I'm happy," says Shimada, whose love for capybaras is only deepening.
Through SNS, he enjoys interacting with capybara lovers from all over the country, such as showing each other his best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who also visits zoos in nearby prefectures to see capybaras, smiled and said, "I want to continue to photograph and transmit information mainly on Mt. Asuwa, which is my home."

Toba City asks for the return of double payment of child-rearing household benefits - Ise Shimbun
Toba City: Toba City announced on the 10th that a total of 600,000 yen was mistakenly paid to 12 people from 11 households regarding the special benefit for child-rearing households living support (for other households) in the third year of Reiwa.
The city says it will apologize to the affected persons, explain the circumstances, and ask for procedures for return.
According to the city, it was discovered on January 27, Reiwa 5, when the parents of the target children who confirmed past payments pointed out.
When 182 people from 79 households were confirmed for all eligible recipients in the same fiscal year, it was found that 12 people from 11 households were paid twice the benefits paid on July 20, Reiwa 3.
The city provides a stipend of 50,000 yen per child to children of high school age or younger in households exempt from resident tax.
It is said that the data extracted from the target children was provided by the computer company to which it was outsourced, but the staff in charge mistakenly assumed that high school students were not included and added it to the data, so they were paid twice.
The person in charge of the city's childcare support office said, "We will take it seriously and make every effort to prevent recurrence, such as rechecking the data, to restore trust."

It's snowing again.
It seems that it is not a cold wave from the north, but the influence of a low pressure system off the south coast that moves east through the Japan archipelago.
It has been a short time since we experienced the abnormally cold weather of the 24th~26th of last month, and we still cannot let our guard down▼ Even with the same cold, the people of the Republic of Turkey, which was hit by a major earthquake, will be even more bearable.
The building collapsed in an instant.
More than 20,000 people have been killed so far, including neighboring Syria, and many people are still stranded in the rubble.
It all started in 1890 (Meiji 23), when the Ottoman Empire dispatched the warship Ertugrul to Japan.
The fact that the residents of Kushimoto Town, Wakayama Prefecture, where the accident occurred, helped and cared for the crew is introduced in movies and novels.▼ About 100 years after this accident, a Turkish aircraft was dispatched to rescue Japanese hostages by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War, and it was repaid for its kindness.
Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
I would like to keep an eye on the situation until the situation has calmed down and reconstruction and restoration.

Belino Hotel Subsidy Fraudulent Receipt Prefectural and Municipal Accommodation Support Project Already Full Refund|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichi Shimbun
The prefectural government and Ichinoseki City announced on the 10th that the Belino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame, Ichinoseki) had been inappropriately used for about a year from October 2021 in their respective subsidy projects to discount the accommodation fees of travelers.
When people who were not eligible for the discount stayed at the hotel, the discount was applied by lending the name of the employee.
It was also confirmed that many employees used accommodation facilities that were not in line with the business purpose of "stimulating tourism demand".
The entire amount of 7,231,000 yen received due to inappropriate use, including voluntary investigations by the prefecture, city, and hotels, has been returned by the 6th of this month.
The subsidies were fraudulently received by the prefectural accommodation discount "Iwate Travel Support Project" implemented in response to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, and the city's "Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount," an emergency measure project for tourist accommodation facilities.
The period was from 10/18/21 to 10/10/22 (9/30/22 for the Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount), and as a result of the survey, there were 95 cases of inappropriate use that was not eligible for the discount, such as outside the target area or unvaccinated, amounting to 587,000 yen, and 1,239 cases of use that did not meet the purpose and purpose of the project, amounting to 6,644,000 yen.
When the prefectural contractor was proceeding with the settlement procedure, it was confirmed that the person in charge of receiving the accommodation discount and the person in charge of reception on the hotel side were the same person.
A detailed investigation by the prefectural government revealed inappropriate use, and the city that received this information also confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already ended, and its registration as a prefectural project was removed on December 2 last year.
In response to the interview, Michiaki Tsuchihashi, CEO of Belino, which operates the hotel, said, "We apologize for the inconvenience caused to the local community, the prefecture and the city, and many people. We are a hotel because of the people of the community, and we want to start again from scratch and work to restore trust," he said, adding that he plans to hold another compliance training session for all employees.
Takahito Chiba, head of the promotion section of the prefectural tourism and promotion office, said, "It is truly regrettable, and we would like to once again encourage compliance with the rules and establish compliance, and call for proper use in accordance with the purpose of the project."
Mayor Yoshihito Sato said, "It is truly regrettable that there was an inappropriate use of the business at a lodging facility in the city."

Nishiwaka-cho Suginahata-no-roadside station Nishikiakiko (store manager Koki Masuoka) will open a ramen specialty "Menya Nishiki" on Thursdays only, which has been closed until now.
We will develop a new tantan noodle (850 yen including tax) made with local ingredients so that more people can enjoy the taste of the local area.
Kinshuko, a restaurant on the same road in the same road, which serves "Yuda Dam Curry" (1,200 yen) and "Nishiwaga Marugoto Ramen" (900 yen), was closed on Thursdays to ensure that the staff had a day off, but customers were disappointed.
In response to this, we started a ramen-only business on the 9th, which can accommodate even a small number of people.
Of the restaurant's menu, it was decided to focus on four items: soy sauce ramen, soy sauce char shu men, miso ramen, and miso char shu men, as well as tantan noodles.
The new tantan noodles, which coincide with the opening of "Menya Nishiki", are based on "Yukikko miso", which is made from soybeans and sun-dried salt from Nishiwaga, and use green onions, Nishi warabi, minced meat, and chili peppers from the town.
We have received many orders since the first day, and we will consider offering services other than Thursdays in the future.
The station on the same road was closed from May 2021 to November 22 due to the closure of National Highway 107.
During this time, he has a history of operating an alternative store "Ramen and Bowl Shop Nishiki" in the same town, and makes use of the know-how he has accumulated.
Manager Masuoka says, "The tantanmen noodles that warm the body are perfect for this time of year, and although the menu is small, I want you to feel happy after eating delicious food."
In winter, the restaurant is open from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. (last order at 2 p.m.).

Introduction of Predecessors of Plant Research Mt. Hayaikemine Collection Materials Municipal Cultural Properties Center Special Exhibition [Hanamaki]|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichi Shimbun
A special exhibition titled "The People Who Introduced the Flowers of Hayaikemine: A Brief History of Hayaikemine Plant Research" is being held at the Municipal Cultural Properties Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City, until the 12th, featuring the predecessors who laid the foundation for botanical research on Mt. Hayaikemine, which is known as a treasure trove of alpine plants.
It collects 124 valuable specimens collected by our predecessors and introduces the footprints of our predecessors who were involved in the botanical research of Mt. Hayaikemine.
The botanical research of Mt. Hayaikemine began with Karl Johann Maximovich (1827~91), a Russian botanical researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Naganosuke Sugawa (1842~1925), a native of Shiwa who collected plants under Maximovich's guidance.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to roam freely in the country because he was a foreigner, asked Sugawa to collect and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support Maximovich's research after returning to Japan, which led to the publication of "Himeko Zakura," "Nambuto Uchisou," and "Miyama Yamabuki Shoma," which are endemic to Mt. Hayaikemine.
After that, modern plant taxonomist Tomitaro Makino (1862~1957) published "Nambutranoo", "Kobano Clover", and "Nambu Inu Thazuna" based on the items collected by local researchers in 1903 (Meiji 36), and in 05 (Meiji 38), he personally climbed Mt. Hayaikemine and discovered and named "Kato Hakobe".
From the exhibits, it can be seen that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
In addition, Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874~1948), the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 27 (Showa 2), and Shichiro Tamagawa (1914~88), who was a curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum and was also involved in the publication of "Plants of Hayaikemine".
Sohei Yoshida, a curator at the center, says, "Behind the names of each plant on Mt. Hayaikemine lies the accumulation of a lot of research and connections between people, and we can trace the connections between researchers that spread from rural areas to the whole country."
The exhibition consists of four chapters: Chapter 1 focuses on the beliefs and history of Hayaikemine, and Chapter 2 focuses on the characteristics of Mt. Hayaikemine from a geological perspective based on surveys by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854~1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation of Japan geology.

Even when the ball changed, his signature fastball shone through.
Lotte's Akira Sasaki (Ofunato Takashi) made his first appearance at the Ishigaki Camp in Okinawa on the 9th, throwing 30 pitches and hitting 160 kilograms in the World Baseball Classic (WBC).
He faced six batters and allowed just two hits, exuding a sense of fulfillment, saying, "I've learned a lot, and my forkball is a little bit better than it was in last year's warm-up game."
The 160 kilos was measured twice, jamming Fujiwara and fouling him, and Yasuda grounding out to second.
Matsukawa calmly put together a pitcher-led pitch distribution with a slider, and when he received the ball, he was impressed with the quality of the finish, saying, "It was a really strong pitch and the batter was plugged in."
Coach Yoshii also seems satisfied with the steady progress made in his fourth year as a professional, saying, "I think things are going well, so far."
As the next step, he will pitch in a practice match against Yakult (Itoman, Okinawa) on the 15th and throw around 40 pitches.
"I'd like to be able to show more accuracy and overall cohesion on the ball," he said.
Idlib Province in northwestern Syria damaged by a major earthquake = early morning on the 9th (provided by local residents)
GAZIANTEP, Southern Turkey (Kyodo) -- The death toll confirmed in Turkey and neighboring Syria exceeded 21,000 on Monday, according to authorities in Turkey and neighboring Syria, which struck southern Turkey.
Rescuing survivors from collapsed buildings in bitter cold is becoming more difficult as time passes.
A desperate search was carried out in the affected areas.
On Monday, the United Nations brought supplies through the Turkish border to the devastated province of Idlib in northwestern Syria for the first time since the earthquake struck on June 6.
Idlib province was the last stronghold of opposition groups against the Assad regime in Syria's civil war, and there were fears that international aid might not reach them.
Rescue operations continue at the affected sites in both countries, using heavy machinery, but they have been difficult.
Many people are said to remain buried in the rubble, and the death toll is likely to rise further.
According to Turkish authorities, 17,674 deaths have been confirmed in Turkey.
Combined with the deaths of more than 3,000 Syrians, the disaster surpasses the 1999 earthquake in northwestern Turkey that killed more than 17,000 people.
Miyako City plans to take its own support measures to subsidize energy expenses such as electricity, gas, and gasoline for businesses in the city that are struggling to secure profits due to soaring fuel and prices.
As an emergency measure, we will invest our own financial resources to support the local economy in a difficult environment.
The target is businesses in all industries (excluding agriculture, forestry and fishermen, electricity and gas supply companies, etc.).
The requirement is that the profit margin for the fiscal year that ended immediately before is lower than the previous year.
The subsidy amount will be paid one-half of the increase compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year for expenses for six consecutive months from April 2022 to March 23, with a maximum of 1 million yen per business.
About 800 people are expected to receive benefits.

Discussion on the introduction of renewable energy and targets Amami Airport 2nd Decarbonization Promotion Council|Society and Economy |Nankai Nipponichi Shimbun
Promotion council meeting to discuss decarbonization of Amami Airport = 9th, Kasari Town, Amami City
In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Amami Airport (Kasari-cho, Amami City), the Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council (Chairman, Takashi Ando, Director of the Construction Division of the Oshima Branch Office, Amami Prefecture, and 13 members), which consists of the prefecture and airlines that use the airport, held its second meeting at the airport on September 9.
All committee members attended, including online.
The two leaders exchanged views on setting decarbonization targets and introducing renewable energy, mainly solar power generation.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by 46% or more by 30 years (compared to FY13) with the aim of achieving "carbon neutrality" by achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year and aims to formulate a plan ahead of the other six airports on the prefecture's other remote islands.
The second meeting, like the first one, was closed to the public, except for the beginning.
According to Chairman Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, the meeting confirmed the airport's greenhouse gas emissions.
In order to set targets and introduce renewable energy, discussions were held in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
According to the handout, the CO2 emissions of the airport's facilities and vehicles in FY13 were 1,476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of these, 1,321 tons of lighting and air conditioning emissions from seven facilities such as airport terminal buildings accounted for about 90% of the emissions, followed by aviation lights at 84 tons and airport vehicles at 71 tons.
The council will proceed with discussions on reducing emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando said, "We are at a passing point, and the committee members are in agreement on the direction, and we would like to first compile a draft interim report."
In the future, the promotion plan will be formulated after hearing opinions on the draft interim report at the third meeting and the draft final report at the fourth meeting.
The flow of attracting people to the island "Sakasama Real Estate" Okinoerabu Branch Office opened People who want to rent a house are looking for a landlord|Society and Economy |Nankai Nipponichi Shimbun
Opening event that deepened the understanding of "Sakasama Real Estate" through talk sessions = 8th, Chinamachi
【Okinoerabu General Bureau】On the 8th, the opening event of the Okinoerabu branch of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate", which visualizes the thoughts of people who want to take on the challenge of renting vacant houses and vacant stores, etc., and recruits landlords, was held at the community space "entaku" in Chinamachi.
Through the talk session, the operating company explained the outline of the service.
Masahiro Okubo, representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri District, Hokkaido), which is in charge of the bureau operation, said, "By doing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we hope to create a movement and flow that will attract people to the entire island."
Sakasama Real Estate is a system that discloses the information of the person who wants to borrow, contacts the lessor, and if an agreement is reached, each person signs a contract on their own, contrary to the normal real estate procedure.
As a demonstration experiment to discover potential vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses, On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) operated the service and started the service in June 2020.
This is the seventh branch office to be opened and the first in Kyushu.
It is the first of its kind on a remote island in Japan.
The event was attended by about 20 people, including On-Co and Tsuginova staff, government office staff from Wadomari and China, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background to the opening of the bureau, saying, "As the movement to attract people from outside the island becomes more active, I thought that if we could make use of vacant houses and stores, the town and the island would become more lively from there."
"We want to connect with people who have properties on the island and want to do something, and help as many people as possible to advance their efforts," he said.
Takeshi Mizutani, CEO of On-Co, pointed out the points to be aware of when managing the area, saying, "It is necessary to take care of each vacant house and discuss what the local people want to do with this area, what kind of people they want to come, and what criteria to choose."
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered," he said, calling on islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

What are the economic effects of shortening working hours?
According to reports of companies that have shortened working hours, employees often improve the efficiency of their work on their own due to the reduction in working hours, which has led to an increase in the company's performance.
Improved performance will increase salaries and holidays, so consumption will also increase, which is also an economic effect.
Automobile studless tires Even if the air pressure is increased, is it not related to driving on snowy roads?
If you increase the air pressure, will you increase fuel efficiency a little?
Does it have to be quite high?
I think the rolling resistance will be better
Studless tires are low-pressure tires, so if you use high pressure, the snow will not bite and it will burst easily, which is not a good thing.

Apply mascara, let it dry, and then divide it into three stages, gradually adding a curve.
If you apply mascara first, it will be easy to put it simply, and it will feel solid (firm), so if you curl it as it is, it will be easy to fix.

I've been to several different dentists, and when I'm sitting in that treatment chair, there are doctors and dental hygienists who talk to me from behind at a slight angle.
I'm not sure if it's better to look backwards for this, but I think it's rude to keep looking backwards because it's hard to look backwards all the time, and it's rude to keep facing forward.

About Instagram.
I currently have about 10,000 followers, but if someone you don't know sees this, do you think it's amazing?
Or do you think nothing else?
What does it look like?
I think it's tremendous.
In the common man, it is a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
Problematic and frustrated
It's hard to find time to exercise, so I bought it to rely on the trendy pressurized innerwear.
The body shape is H175m W80kg I bought the L size.
It's quite a struggle at first to put it on, but once you get used to it, I think you'll be fine.
I used it for a few days, but now I am using another pressurized inner layer due to a problem.
The problem is 1, if the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the upper arm) is too tight and it becomes a little congestion, itchy.
2. The lower abdomen is loose I stopped using it due to the above two problems.
It's quite tight in terms of comfort, but there is no problem even if you sleep while wearing it.
Good deal for those who fit
Even at 158cm and 50kg, S was fine.
But it didn't suit me because of my large skeleton and muscularity.
Since it is not three-dimensional, such as the buttocks, it is easy to create strange gaps and fall down, which is not comfortable.
I felt like I had to pull it up all the time.
I think it's good if you have a body shape like a stick.
In terms of thickness, I guess you could say that it is safe thin.
It wasn't henna henna or it looked like it was going to tear, but I was able to boot in even with tight-fitting knee-high boots and make it refreshing.

I didn't want to show too much skin on my upper body, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit.

^) I just received it and I just tried it on and it wasn't in the water, so I don't know how durable it is or what it feels like when it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is firm, and I thought it was a bargain at this price.
There was no wire in the bust part, but when I touched it, it seemed that there was a hard core at the bottom of the pad.
But it doesn't hurt to wear it, and it follows the bust properly, so I think it looks good when I move.
Did you change the model from no pads to with them?
(^.

45 kg 156 cm, a little big at M size.
The raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but I think it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
It came with two rain protection visors to keep my face from getting wet.
There was no problem with the strength, and I was able to use it safely even on a bicycle in a windstorm.
It was not torn after use.
I carry it in a compact state in a compression bag.
Truly, it was a product that exceeded my expectations at this price.
I was able to install it safely.
I installed it on the CLA 180 shooting brake on the 2016 model year.
Even an amateur can wear it by reading YOU tube or the instructions.
Be careful not to loosen the Torx screws too much, causing the screws to fall into the car.
I dropped one and went missing.
After that, if you sandwich the gray connector between the brown, red, and green wiring and caulk it, and if you do it with a type with a tapered tip, such as pliers, the force will not be evenly applied, and the plastic will crack as shown in the photo, and you will not be able to install it.
When I called support, they mailed me a new cable the next day, and it is a company that has very good support.
When I tried again, I caulked it with a wide pair of pliers as shown in the photo in the instruction manual, and it worked.
When I put the last main unit back in the car, it took a little time to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After installing it, I can watch DVD, TV, and navigation without any problems while driving.
I think it is a very cost-effective product because it costs over 80,000 yen if you order it at a dealer and over 40,000 yen at a specialty store.
Below the price
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated First of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it's cut in the cushion and there are fluffy parts and squishy parts It seems that it has already been worn out Or rather, there are few cotton overall, and I thought after using it, I thought that the product with the head and the pillow part integrated may or may not fit unless you try it I thought that it would be better for the pillow and body pillow to be separate This time I bought it for 3600 yen at a time sale, but I want to return it In the first place, I reflected that I should be more wary of reviews with 5 stars
Yes and no
The product arrives.
I was allowed to use it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use, and you can milk properly.
However, there are times when I feel that the sound is a little annoying, and the power button is not responsive.
I don't mind it because I can use it without any problems, but those who care may be bothered.
It's not super quiet, so 😅 if you use it in the middle of the night, you may be a little careful.
Also, I was worried that the part that connects the attached tube and the machine will go into the tube, but it came 😂 in the form of pushing it in.
You need a knack for whipping...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair type or if it's just a performance issue with this shampoo, but it doesn't lather at all with normal use.
(The shampoo I've been using so far has been lathering without any problems even if I use it normally) So, here is the solution I found ↓ (1) First, pick up less shampoo than usual and blend it all over your hair.
(At this point, it does not foam at a level where not a single foam appears) (2) Rinse your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo and blend it into your hair.
(This will finally lather normally) Well, in short, it's washed twice lol The volume of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo the first time as much as possible ... I am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It's clear that I bought a shampoo that was so expensive, but I definitely felt that my hair felt better.
However, my honest impression is that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
It's a pity that the Quattro Botanico series was indebted to the face wash goods ...
Even though the capacity is small, it is not cost-effective because it is forced to be washed twice.
In addition, considering the scent that seems to be popular with everyone, I will give it 2 stars here a little strictly.
Evaluation is difficult
There are negatives and positives, and it is difficult to evaluate.
The front side of the blade is cleaned with a blade cleaner.
I think it is a good match with a razor with good accuracy of the original blade.
Positive: As intended, dirt on the blade such as sebum and soap scum can be removed.
If the sharpness is deteriorated due to the dirt (only on the front side), it will last a long time.
Negatives: The life of the smoother is drastically reduced.
Titanium coats, ceramic coatings, and other coatings that are coated on the cutting edge are prone to peeling off.
(After using about 2~3 shavings, most of the coating will peel off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner after that.)
Be careful with razors that say do not wipe the edge.
I feel that it is cost-effective because it can be substituted with anti-fall rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that is put under furniture used as an earthquake preparation.
* I use it and it is about to increase the life of the razor by 20~30%.
It's difficult to tell when to throw away a razor blade, but I think it's when the blade is damaged by shaving and the edge of the blade is rattled.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness down due to dirt.
(It is only a cleaner and does not have the effect of sharpening.) Sometimes it feels like it's being sharpened, but that's because a little rust has been removed. ）
Caught up in a TV commercial...
I saw that the face of a fairly elderly woman was lifted up just by applying it once in a TV commercial, so I bought it.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little firmer than a normal gel, and I wiped it off with a pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and disgusting, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will enter your skin unexpectedly.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and it felt like the skin was sticking to my hands.
The lift-up didn't work like on TV.
I felt the firmness at once.
I have super dry skin, so this one is not enough, so I have been using a certain Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It feels just moisturizing.
I was expecting that the sagging pores would also be covered, but it is not.
I think it would be effective to use a bottle, and if there is, I think there is a lipi.
It must have been a lot of work to put it together, but...
It is a work of labor that looks back and summarizes the statements of politicians over the past few years.
As I read it, I am somehow convinced that that remark at that time was that after all.
However, considering its value as a reading material, it is a delicate point whether the "fact-checking" that the authors call it is necessary and sufficient.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the main flaw in this book was the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" here is eternally true.
I felt that it was quite suspicious from the way they wrote whether they were aware of the fragility (falsifiability) of "fact checking".
When it comes to the current level of awareness of "facts" among Japan reporters, I feel a little gloomy.
Many people seem to recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge of the content covered by this book.
If there are readers who, like the reviewer, are interested in the "fact-checking" conducted by the current Japan media, this book may not be for you.
For those who do not improve their scores on mock exams.
At my school, political economy was printed out, and it was really boring because it was a class format that made me feel like I was being forced to study, and before I knew it, I hated political economy.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Currently at the center this year in high 3.
Since I bought it in March, I have chosen it as my study partner for an hour on the way to and from school.
First impressions are easy to understand.
You've reached the realm of God.
When I finished one lap and took the past question, I was 70 when I was 40 at the time.
As expected, I was surprised.
It stretches so much that I wonder if I ate something strange.
I was able to feel that what I could get from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about political economy, but also improved my abilities and motivation for studying.
I'm really grateful that I was able to meet him.
prevention of crime
Eight years ago, I experienced two attempts to pick the front door, and I have been taking crime prevention measures.
This time I am replacing the camera I bought 8 years ago.
In the past, I used to use an infrared irradiation 30m type (another company).
This product was written by another person, but the distance that can recognize faces at night is about 5m.
I agree.
I just arrived and haven't set it up, but I'm at the stage of comparing the camera reflection and checking for defects.
The image quality is much better than the camera of 8 years ago (naturally).
I divided it into 4 parts on a 32-inch monitor, but there is no problem if the shooting size is maximized.
So far, there are no defects in the product.
If you are considering a level of facial recognition other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with night photography, but at this price, it is the best!
I'm for crime prevention, but I don't ask for facial recognition.
Because if you are masked or masked, you won't know (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems to distinguish between a high-performance camera and a recording.
On the other hand, if you're not a professional, you'll be in trouble.
However, recent burglaries are bold and clever, so we recommend that you use them in combination with various crime prevention goods instead of relying only on cameras.
For example, there is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained at a home improvement store for about 1,500 yen (the latest one is very bright with 6 units).
Since it is solar, there is no need for electricity, but in winter, it does not turn on until morning, so there are also three 100V motion LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters at which we could recognize a human figure.
Also, if you think that the intimidation effect is diminished because the camera is small in daytime crime prevention, I think you need to devise a cover.
I have a sticker that says "24-hour security camera in operation".
It is an original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
It is more effective for manufacturer's products than to stick those sold at home centers.
The place to put it is a thief's entry route that will not be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time~.
At the same time, it is difficult to understand the instruction manual of the net setting, so I made it a minus.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up and setting, we will add them.
Empathy so much that it hurts to read
If you were born in Japan in '82, the social situation may be slightly better than her, but the situation is still far from equal even after the Equal Employment Opportunity Law has been enforced.
As I read on, the painful memories of surviving discrimination as a member of society came back and I felt suffocated.
It depicts the suffering of not only Korea and Japan, but also all women who try to live as human beings rather than women in feudal societies.
Isn't it time for women alone to stop their emotional confrontation and stand shoulder to shoulder to face this society?
A drama that makes you think, "Men are the worst"
This is the story of the main character, who was sexually abused by his biological father when he was a child.
Naturally, even as an adult, he continues to drag his wounds with him.
All the men who come out are the worst.
The husband of the main character, who seems to be mild-mannered and family-oriented, is also the worst in a sense.
There are spoilers ↓ Even if the protagonist's sister knows that she is being DV by her husband, she ignores it, and the sister-in-law finally has the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the main character's husband, who is a police officer, goes through.
The protagonist's elderly mother, who pretends to be a blur, is aware of the fact that her husband (the protagonist's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter does not know it (officially, the death of her biological father is a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of the rapist father, it seems that he did not let his daughter receive counseling, so it is natural that the main character will go crazy.
Why does the protagonist's daughter want to hear about her dead grandfather?
Do you care so much about the old man who died at such a young age?
In the drama? Too much.
A few years ago, during the summer when a heat wave hit France, it was reported that the morgue in Paris was full because many elderly people died and hospitals and institutions could not take them in because they were on vacation, even if they contacted their daughters and sons.
These people are "dry".
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that they were "dry" after all.
French films are completely different from those in the United States, and there are many ambiguous parts that give a good aftertaste, but there are relatively many scenes that I thought should be cut.
Professional Boundaries
If the meticulous calculations and the unexpected accident that could not be read were at stake in someone's life, they must have been prepared to take the risk of their own lives, even if they had calculated from the beginning to some extent.
The script was brilliant in embodying the subtle drama of her struggles, which she struggled with in her own way, which she did not show in public, and how far she would go to deceive those around her in order to pass her beliefs.
Even if you put it on... Jessica's acting is truly amazing.
No matter what you see, you can't go wrong.
It's a professional job.
Usability Then it broke down
I've used 3 of them so far, and this product broke down in no time, for better or worse.
The reason for choosing this product was that I used the first 2200 mA built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out after 200 degrees 5 minutes 3 sessions.
The second USB port is defective.
It cannot be charged.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but when I reinserted the battery about 15 times (I was using the battery with the charger so that the USB terminal would not break), the contact became worse or it became difficult to turn on.
When the lid is pressed, the power is turned on.
If you are an ICOS user, you may have experience.
It's that symptom.
As mentioned in the precautions, the batteries do not use batteries other than those attached.
The nails and catches seem to be machined, so there seems to be no bending.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought it without the Starry logo at the same time as I returned it, but I will describe how it compares to this.
Appearance size, the same.
The same goes for the chamber and the draw.
LCD This one is prettier.
It may be newer than without a logo.
Vibrator This one is modest.
It's like a vibrator on your smartphone.
Without a logo, the vibration or sound of the vibrator is loud.
A cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese, but ...
The attachments are slightly different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without logo, it is a lump like steel wool.
It's roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks quickly, it will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so I proceeded with the procedure, although it was troublesome.
It's just an ear rubber, but it's an ear rubber
This flat rubber really doesn't hurt.
In terms of ear feel, it is the best mask of the same type that I have used so far.
Even with flat rubber, it may be twisted and the twisted heli part may rub against the base of the ear, which may be more painful than round rubber, but I think that this product is not only soft to the touch, but also the length is just hard to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is good, and not only does it fit, but there is also a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the chin = in front of the mouth, so it is difficult to feel suffocated.
Maybe it's because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it will suit everyone in the same way, but if you think that any of the other smaller sizes are not good, I think it is a good idea to try it once.
When I opened the outer box, it was in a vinyl with a central slit like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear elastics on both sides got caught and it was difficult to take out, so I reduced it by one star.
The response of the contractor is 1 star
The price and taste are perfect, but I was distrustful of the response of the vendor who ignored and sent it to me even though I specified the date.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy on Amazon, so I know the delivery person.
In particular, I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible because it carried heavy items to the top, but it was ruined.
It is said that the shipping company is having a hard time because of Amazon, but I am thinking that there is one thing that users can cooperate with.
I'm disappointed with the response of the arrogant vendors.
But the price is low.
If you are considering purchasing, include disposal costs
There are a large number of complaints, and I don't think it can be used for long.
I think it's a good idea to consider including the cost of disposal.
For reference, it seems that some municipalities have centers that accept bulky garbage for free or at a low cost if you bring it in.
The seat tilts slightly to the left and wobbles even more, making it very tiring to sit on.
If you move even a little, it will make a loud creaking noise.
It is too noisy to use at night.
This is my biggest problem, and I feel that I can't continue to use it with this.
[Assembly] Assembly instructions are only explained with rough drawings.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
・ There is no explanation of the orientation when installing the seat surface and the support base Some people write in the review that it leans forward, but there is a possibility that the direction when installing the seat and the post fixing platform is reversed.
When installed correctly, the height adjustment lever is facing backwards on the right hand side, and the dial for adjusting the spring direction on the back is forward.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural to face forward, many people will install it incorrectly.
There are no such basic precautions in the manual, and you will have to assemble while looking at a rough picture and doing trial and error.
・ There is an error in the description of the contents The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who look for 12 8x20mm screws because they can't find them.
The 8x20mm screw is already inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for it unnecessarily.
The machining accuracy is low, and it seems that there are combinations that can be inserted even with the same screw hole and screw, and combinations that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with screws inserted like this.
Also, I couldn't find the spare screws in the instructions.
[Other] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather is unevenly colored, and it is whitish in some places, so it is better not to expect something as beautiful as the product photo.
An explanation of the inadequacy of the instruction manual and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method were sent to the email address registered on Amazon 2~3 days after the product arrived.
Normally, these items should be released immediately after the product is shipped.
In 2~3 days after the product arrives, many purchasers have completed the assembly, so it is a completely meaningless act.
Well let's see
I'm a big fan of thermos and have been using the thermos straw type for more than 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use I've ever used.
(1) The spout parts of the straw are made of a harder material than before, and the grooves are so that they click into the main body, and the spout parts of the straw cannot be removed from the main body at all!
！ I desperately tried to take it and my nails cracked.
(2) Only the tip of the spout of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush no longer fits.
(3) The mysterious part called the valve attached to the end of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and is dramatically more difficult to wash.
I've never had any complaints about using the straw type so far, so I'm a little shocked.
It's really stressful to not be able to take a spout from the main body.
The good thing is that it still has outstanding cold retention.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and washed it the next day, there was still about 50% of the ice I put in the day before.
I don't drink HOT, so I'm still a straw type.
Thank you for improving it in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(This is the impression of an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing doll eyes for the first time) The product as shown in the photo arrived.
When I put it on the Obitsu doll, it was very cute and the light came in and I was very satisfied.
However, when wearing it (entrance), it is a little stiff and cannot be attached unless it is pushed in with force.
I think the way to do it is different, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping Since it was my first time shipping from overseas, I was aiming for 3 weeks, but it arrived in 8 days (near Narita Airport) earlier than I expected.
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
If you look at the description of Amazon shipping earlier, it is written that it is still shipping.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and there was a lot of bubble wrap on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it is safe for the time being.
However, the phone number was printed on the envelope, so is it okay to have personal information even though it is an email service from overseas?
I felt doubtful, so I will set it to minus 1.
The product is not a problem, and I think it is a great bargain for this amount at that price.
P.S. Doll Eye 8mm Model iPhonese
A bit small (small working area), severely electrified
I ordered it after seeing the size notation, but I felt that it was about two times smaller than I had imagined.
Although it is larger than A4 size, the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I was thinking of using it when repairing electronic devices and making Gunpla, but as expected, it is difficult to use without B4 size.
It may be possible to manage if you use it only for soldering iron work and use another tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly.
Within a magazine-sized area, you can place tools, place parts, and do more work. It's impossible.
I thought about ordering another one of the same thing and doubling the area, but I think it would be difficult to continue using it for a while because the charge is so severe during the work that the dust and the cut parts are all sucked up.
Fatal defects
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened the lid using a rubber non-slip sheet, but when I tried to load the battery and close it, it would not close.
At this point you are out.
Highly rated!
Does the battery box lid close???
I should add that instead of a protective sticker on the product, there was a small saran wrap that was sticking to it.
Is this a second-hand item???
The explanation is only in English written on a small piece of paper.
There is no explanation of the illustrations, and no one knows how to operate it.
It might be good for other fingers...
I found a good product!
I bought it right away.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, it won't fit perfectly, and it's a little lumpy ... Was.
But I think it's good for use on other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea seller.
For the price
After all, you shouldn't expect quality from this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
The size is just right when I put it on.
Although it may be tough for people with thick ears.
Maybe I should have bought a patternless one.
Yabana
The design is good, but it's big when you put it on your hand, so I wonder if the effect won't fade even if you put it on your feet?
In the eastern part of Hokkaido in the middle of winter...
As mentioned in other people's reviews, the heating wire is only 110×80 net, and the arrangement is horizontal instead of vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the entire futon evenly, and although it is more expensive than the bedding type, it is better to be large, but I can't help it because I can't check it at the store like famous manufacturers.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and 〇 Tori N Warm.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
It's well done, but
It is small and has sufficient air volume.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare.
If you want to adjust the angle by placing it on a desk, it is better to do it as shown in the photo.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will be blown away by your own wind power, but if you lay a handkerchief, there is no problem.
If you use it outside, you won't notice it even if it's "inside", but if it's an office, it's noisy even if it's "small".
It is necessary to divide it as a companion when going out.
Also, in office use, even if it is "small", the air volume is too large and it is too cold.
It is ideal for scenes where you sweat a lot on the go, escape to a family restaurant, and cool down at once with "large".
The only thing is that when you throw it in your bag, on rare occasions, the power button is pressed and it stays spinning without you knowing.
It would be nice if you could retract the button slightly (cave in) or hold down the weak first press.
It is an indispensable item in the era of extreme heat, which is life-threatening, so it would be helpful if you could make something better.
Multi-function light speaker
I use the weakest warm color and put it in my bedroom.
It's better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the luminosity and color by touch.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with gradation, so it is beautiful.
Also, if you touch it in your favorite color, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it glow according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, you can expect a long life.
As for the sound quality, I think it is more than enough for my ears as an amateur.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it is multifunctional.
・A large speaker is attached to the top.
It can be paired with a mobile phone via Bluetooth, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
・ If you pair it with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
In addition, since it is also compatible with MicroSD, it can be linked with a computer and can play music as an mp3 player.
Typing and Piano Practice
At the age of 66, he started taking on the challenge of DTM to prevent blurring.
Purchased an audio interface and this instrument.
At first, I was typing, but I became addicted to playing the piano and spent my days practicing.
I downloaded the attached sound source, but the protection didn't work, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but the free piano sound source sounds good, so I use it for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel like I've been deceived by the way I look.
Is it a hit-or-miss product?
It's going to be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the Doshisha office chair (flip-up armrest) that has been used for 4~5 years has deteriorated and become tattered, so we are considering purchasing a chair with flip-up armrests made of non-synthetic leather.
I looked at home improvement stores and furniture stores, but I couldn't find anything suitable.
I am worried that I will not be able to confirm the actual product, but I compromised on the appearance of the design and the price and purchased this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
Caution: The included hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I didn't know the oil adhered to the hex wrench, and the body was white, so I was impatient when the oil was attached.
Assemble in 40 minutes.
Completed and confirmed the product.
The hardness of the flip-up armrests is different between the left and right, and the left side is heavy and the right side is light, and the armrests are not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has a weak fixing force and immediately hangs down with a "click" sound.
The seat feels stiff because of the non-regenerated high-density polyurethane foam, and it is not comfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?).
The competition mesh for the backrest is harder than other companies' mesh chairs, and if you wear light clothes, your back will hurt.
It's a small detail, but the height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 (the height of the seat height is important for height) Also, the legs that support the casters are not made of steel, so there are doubts about durability.
I put a cushion that I bought separately, and the mesh fabric part is likely to deteriorate (damage) quickly, so I use a towelette.
As a 186 cm 80 kg, I felt that only the fit of the back was good, but other than that, I think it is a product that is not satisfactory, and I feel that it is a hit or miss product.
After all, it may be better to sit on the actual office chair and buy it.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer greeting the purchase, so should I inquire about the armrests and headrests?
Under consideration.
Well, I guess it's something like this.
In my environment, it seems that I can see BS4K in right turns, so I bought a Pixera 4K tuner that was cheap without much expectation.
As an experiment, I was able to watch NHK BS4K and other right-hand free broadcasts, and I was able to watch it beautifully on a Panasonic 4K TV that I purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the image is choppy) The update came immediately after purchase, and it became recording compatible, so I have made some scheduled recordings and watched it, but I wonder if the external is due to the influence of a 2.5-inch HDD, and only the image stops in playback, or the frame skips occurs.
The user interface is not a compliment by any means, and it is said that "4K broadcasting can be seen".
By the way, during scheduled recording, it feels like you can only chase and play back the recorded program, and I accept this area as a plus function that you can record in 4K on the HDD.
If you buy with various expectations, you may be disappointed, so don't expect too much.
I hope it will be improved with an update.
Keep warm function OK
I have only used the keep warm function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it became warm in about 2 hours and became hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it in the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan noise is worrisome when idling is stopped, but I don't feel it at all while driving.
Perhaps because it was still new, I was worried about the smell of chemicals emitted by the fan, so I had to open the windows regularly to ventilate.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr in the part where the shoulder string is passed is terrible, so it is necessary to break the burr with a flat screwdriver.
Really fragile
Today, after 2 months of using it, it suddenly broke.
I liked the feel of the keys and the size, but there is no point in breaking them.
I use my PC all day for video processing, but the volume goes to 100% on its own.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use the earphones because my ears hurt, and the volume is too loud to use the PC at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display appears and disappears on the computer screen repeatedly.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the mouse instructions, so you cannot use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard every time.
The enter and backspace keys are also no longer responding.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's for 1,000 yen, you may want to buy it as a trial.
If you're lucky, you'll be able to use it for about half a year.
Compared to other companies' 1~3-year warranty even in the same price range, this is a 6-month warranty.
The short warranty period speaks to its fragility.
The product is the best, the packaging is the worst
I love the product because it comes in different colors.
I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a food stocker!
However, there was a gap so large that it rolled into a large cardboard, and there was no delivery note, so the packaging was the worst.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
I recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for the time being
When I bought a new lid, I bought it because the support was unforgiving.
It plays a role in stabilizing the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a disgusting sound of "mekimeki, (about to break)".
You have to choose the one that fits the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when purchasing.
Bag with cute paw pads
I have a dog and when I was looking for a bag to go out, I was attracted to a stylish gray bag and bought this one.
It was assembled and erected, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so it was not so heavy to hold.
The zipper also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as a snag.
It seems to be easy even for long trips.
It becomes very compact and easy to fold.
Even if you fold it, you can see the paw design, and it is cute even if you put it down.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love with the appearance and low price at first sight! I bought it.
TSA Rock has been my favorite for a few years here, and I have a few others, but it's convenient.
And as a master of forgetting or losing keys, number locks are recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it's good, but if you want durability and security, the zipper is a week, and it's cloth, so you can use a knife! If it is cut, it will break in an instant.
Also, the matching of the zippers is sweet, so I would like to see a way to overlap them.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to carry it on board.
For the time being, I used it on a bullet train trip and it was comfortable.
It's hard to choose a size...
It's hard to buy shoes because they're wide.
Converse and buns wear 24 cm.
The MRL996 is also 24 cm.
Is it tough at first? I thought, but once I got used to it, I didn't care.
My sister said that 24.5 cm was tough for this ML574, so when I wore it, it was certainly tight.
It felt like my little finger was hitting me.
Therefore, I bought 25 cm.
When I received it and opened it, it was big ...
When I put it on, it was a little loose even if I was wearing socks.
I was worried about returning it, but it would be troublesome if it became tight at 24.5, so I will wear it with insoles at 25 as it is.
I bought Team Red and it's bright red and very good!
There are many monotone clothes in black and white, so wearing this will brighten it up!
165cm, male in his 40s
I ordered the L size at random, but if you have similar specifications below, we recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm It is a typical metabolic belly.
< feast> In the water, the rash guard turns up, probably because the waist is loose.
I'm swimming while fixing the part that has been turned up.
Especially if you are not careful in the jacuzzi, your metabolic belly will be in full view.
Also, if you walk while moving up and down vigorously, it will still turn up from the bottom.
< how to make the product> The fabric is durable and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples showing through.
At this price, I can be satisfied with this kind of construction, but I think it will be better to buy a smaller one.
After all, there was a gas leak ...
The Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, and when I replaced the valve, there was a problem that part of the tank was chipped, but I used [Bass Bond Q] to seal the tank and grease up the repair, and I was able to hit it well, if you want to buy this Colt 25, ask someone who can disassemble or assemble it. I don't have the ability to disassemble it while taking digital camera photos, so I can't recommend it to those who are not confident, but if you think it's okay to break, it may be fun, I bought another black Colt 25, the trick to disassembling is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, and I managed to disassemble it without the parts flying. When assembling, I applied silicone grease to springs and small parts and assembled them while fixing them with grease, when disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screws, remove the safety, remove the two screws on the left body, and remove the tip of the barrel so that it does not scratch the tip of the barrel and do not pinch the front sight and the inner barrel with pliers. Then you can slowly remove the left side of the Monaca structure and disassemble it, just don't blame others if you fail at your own risk.
I wondered what kind of quality 188 yen was
You can use it when you need fast turning and torque.
It's light and small, and above all, it's simple without any pretentiousness.
There is no rattling when the bit is attached, and I thought that 188 yen with this was a surprising cost performance.
The other thing is durability.
You may not use it very often, but I think it's a good thing to have in your toolbox.
I bought it together with the "1/4" Hex Shank Magnetic Quick Release Driver Knurled Bit Holder 60/100/150 mm from the same vendor.
There was no problem here, or rather, it was quite good for the price.
Controller stuck
Your ship will move on its own and you will not be able to operate it.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine immediately moves in the wrong direction and cannot be operated.
It is better not to buy this product.
I would like to warn you.
It's a terrible product.
Although it is wired, we recommend the controller of BEBONCOOL PS3.
It is reliable and has not yet broken even after a long period of use.
You can also use it for PC games.
・・・・・・ P.S. I was able to refund the Amazon gift certificate if I returned it as a defective product within one month, so I think that was a good thing.
Will this increase your computing power?
I think it's suitable for children who understand calculations.
Isn't it impossible unless the child understands calculations to some extent?
The problem is difficult to understand.
Also, when I give tools to the master, I slide the things on the screen up with my fingers, but I tried it myself, but no matter how many times I did it, it didn't go smoothly.
In short, it may be easier to slide for those who are used to DS.
I don't like the illustrations of cartoon figures, or rather, I think that DS and other devices may be entered because of the fun of the screen, but for some reason I don't feel familiar with them.
The calculation method is also like a race against time, for example, how many questions to answer correctly in a few minutes.
I understand the feeling of rushing with exams and things like that, but ... Won't you be impatient and calculate?
I also don't like the gong that sounds when it's over, for some reason.
Wouldn't it be nice to make it sound more pleasant even though you're working so hard?
I feel like I lost some money on 6,200 yen with this.
I understand if it's half this price.
I'm sorry, I ended up with ☆ 2 pieces like this.
After all, Persona's songs are good!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played halfway through.
Persona 4 has already been troconned on Vita.
What you can do hasn't changed since the previous game, Persona 4.
The lack of a story makes it feel shorter than the previous game.
The song is really cool!
Just listening to it will lift your mood!
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Somehow, Junpei looked handsome (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so there is no freshness ...... When you think about it, I feel that 3 is a better deal.
As a music game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is covered with the background.
There are a lot of assist functions, so even those who are not good at music games can play it.
If you are an expert in music games, you may be able to turn on the challenge function to make the game more chewy.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just a bonus, it's a solid four-disc set, so if you like Persona's songs, this is the one I recommend.
It's kind of a shame
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual product is bluish, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I've been thinking about buying gold, but it's pending for now, and the price is so low that I wonder if I can give up.
P.S. After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller apologizing and exchanging it for a new product.
The subsequent processing was also fast.
I think the response was very good despite the inexpensive product.
4 stars for correspondence P.S. After that, I also bought gold.
I think the color is almost as shown in the photo and is very beautiful.
But after all, the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the explanatory photo is obvious.
That's the only pity.
It gets very heavy in the evening.
I used it for my SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setup, I didn't know how to do it after I arrived in Korea and pointed the SIM, so I asked the lady at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to teach me (turn on data roaming from the mobile > communication options in the settings > the settings), and I was able to do it well.
It seems that the instruction manual attached to the product was not very relevant ...?
However, the radio wave around Gimpo Airport was poor, so I grabbed 3G all the time.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
In the evenings and nights, my connection sometimes became very heavy, but now that I think about it, I may have reached the limit of up to hundreds of MB per day.
Better than I thought
I used a SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim-free and used it with Ymobile, and the Z4 was not doing well, so I was looking for a used Xperia phone, and I found this phone that can be used with a new phone and bought it.
Since I was using Mobile Suica, I was worried about whether I would be able to use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
Size, weight, I bought silver, so I took a quick look at the iPhone 6? That's my impression.
I don't play GAME, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, and I have the impression that it's a little faster In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but I have the impression that it takes a little time to recognize So face recognition is faster, so I'm using it here.
I thought it was amazing because it looked like an iPhone I also made Android Ver9 and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
What I was worried about It should be a little smaller No strap hole * Compatible with a case with a strap hole I haven't experimented with water resistance A little heavy I've only used a little yet, but I'm satisfied I recommend it
