Stars give off light and heat because energy is released when hydrogen atoms combine (or stay) to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and it may be many years before we see useful nuclear reactors.
A steel needle can float on the surface of water due to surface tension.
Surface pressure occurs because water molecules at the surface of water are more attracted to each other than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible layer on the surface of the water, making things look like needles.
Modern ice skates have two edges with a hollow in between. Even if the edges are slanted, it can grip the ice better.
Because the blade is tilted to one side or the other, the bottom of the blade is slightly curved. The edge where it hits the ice is also curved.
This caused the skater to turn. If the skate is tilted to the left, the skater will turn to the left, and if the skate is tilted to the right, the skater will turn to the right.
to return to their previous energy level; They must dissipate the additional energy gained from the light.
&quot;They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a ``photon&#39;&#39;.&quot;
&quot;As atoms are stimulated by bright light to emit photons of light, scientists call this process ``stimulated radioactivity,&#39;&#39; and light is also a form of radioactivity.&quot;
The next picture shows atoms emitting photons. In fact, Photons are much smaller than the picture shows.
Photons are much smaller than what atoms are made of.

The omnivore eats the leaves first before consuming the tree trunk.
Other scientists argue that the plants were so poisonous that no dinosaur could have eaten them, and that today&#39;s animals like parrots and parrots (a species descended from dinosaurs) could eat the poisonous leaves or fruit.
How will your gravity pull me? If you stand on the surface of Earth, you will weigh less than if you stand on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Earth. Therefore, Earth&#39;s gravity pulls on you less.
