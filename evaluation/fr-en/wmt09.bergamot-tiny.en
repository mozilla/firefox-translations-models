At the end of the exchange, the Prague Stock Exchange fell into the negative
After Tuesday morning's fall, the Prague Stock Exchange reselected its losses.
Transactions with the shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed its fall the day before, when it lost almost six per cent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in Wall Street stock.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilise the US financial sector, is also noticeable here.
Falling of actions in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the evidence succeeded, during the day, in clearing some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng index lost four percent during trade, but later it erated part of the losses and reduced the fall to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movement of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than five percent, but eventually losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the rescue action in the US will affect the financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, the head of Hong Kong's monetary board.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates are in Hong Kong at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Ruddd, US legislators should soon resume negotiations and adopt the financial system’s proposal for support.
Otherwise, the impact of other countries is likely to be affected.
The bloodshed of American actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the proposed support for the financial system, to which it should have spent up to USD 700 billion (nearly 12 bilions of K-).
Legislators thus deny the call for support from President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the entire economy.
US actions experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the largest equity indices fell in 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having fallen to such a scale for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it became clear that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress ceded: US government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the US financial system financial aid agreement.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
American legislators made a turning point in talks on the adoption of a bailout in the form of financial assistance worth 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion kroner), granted to the US financial system.
However, success is not certain.
Before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Said on Sunday at Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday as soon as possible, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a major primary psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
Given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, there will be a "disillusionment".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differing views on the form that the package of measures should be taken for the market stabilisation," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg Agency.
In her view, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, legislators met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the back burner to the government a final form.
The Government is expected to buy back unsale real estate assets from financial companies that drive financial firms in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system in its entirety.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on declining equity markets.
According to the Democratic senator, Harry Reid did, legislators so that Congress would come to a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trade begins in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congressional decision could affect Monday’s trade.
For the time being, however, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two chambers of the United States Congress will vote, or whether the negotiations are unlikely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by a particular problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there are still many changes in the law.
The total amount for the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress feels that the program is not performing its function, it has the option of blocking the allocation of the remaining amount, by following two steps: first an additional 100 billion dollars, then, finally, 350 billion dollars.
Mr. Bush boosted progress in negotiations
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to out4%.
Despite these changes, the program’s main idea of getting finances for buying bad real estate securities, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says that legislators agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting contributors from losses, the adjustment agreement, the course of the plan on the time axis.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
'We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,' said Paulson.
The plan also provides for assistance for homeowners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new down payments in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance Chief Economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to achieve.
"And this is due to the fact that it is not known what the mechanism and the price of the buy-back of problem assets will be.
This will be crucial to deciding on the loss-sharing between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week to iHNed.cz.
If the plan is adopted now, or early next week, according to Marek, is not that important enough.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," stressed Marek.
Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have a total of 29 percent
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party, where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously threatened, suffered particularly large losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria, the governor of Carinthia, Joerg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the vote.
The SVP, which at 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, finished even worse.
These were the worst results of the two major parties in the post-war period; especially for the People's Party, which had called the early elections, the result was literally catastrophic.
Even in early July, when the zVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SP.
But voters are visibly chastising them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were uttered.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday, at the party’s extraordinary board of directors.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the way towards the outcome of the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the grand coalition, the SP- and 'VP' coalition.
Nevertheless, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties would have obtained 18 per cent and the B' 11 per cent of the votes - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a 1999 repetition, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPO was still unified, it was in 2005 that the Beg separated itself) on a common government.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently to highlight this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell back from the third in the third to fifth place.
Clearly, no other party crossed the four-percentage limit and did not accede to parliament.
An extreme struggle: MP3 readers against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobile phones can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
The result is clearly that it is better to buy only a telephone.
However, there are sufficient reasons for obtaining an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the future owner is used and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are crammed vinyl records in your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same applies to music during the movement, namely compressed music, to put it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here, too, there are categories according to price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 kroons on a reader, just as a fan of Pink Floyd would have difficulty supporting earphones bought for twenty kroons at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of batteries is also decisive
Some top-of-the-range music players are capable of many more things than simple music playback, but these are unknown functions, of course, most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and the sending of SMS, he is able to read music and films, to record them, he has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, until he is used for navigation.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing almost a miracle.
However, the universal nature of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two rechargings.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goofers.
Rare mobile phones are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is much lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary) perform much better.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you may call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharging for work - this being valid even for more expensive devices.
Problem will not arise for MP3 readers, who are capable, following reloading, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, since a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all of them can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
It is possible, of course, to record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in the mobile devices.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need, except in exceptions (iPod), any software.
All you have to do is fill, through the USB connector, the music device coming from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a classified media library based on the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or according to the user's judgment.
Some devices display only an index having a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones have more know-how
In choosing a concrete device, be particularly interested in the lifetime of the accumulator, in the capacity of the memory, in the quality and type of output of sound and, of course, in the ease of control.
If the music is essentially for you, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading MP3.
Virtually all mobile phones are capable of doing so today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player is able to read.
All of them manage to read MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have precisely this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA music.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods), on the other hand, is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding operator's web pages (or those of another supplier) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to obtain a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is miserable and is, in most cases, limited to rapidly made radio tubes.
Prices are also not the lowest.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their motives in on themselves.
Every time you feel like listening to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, when you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always carry earphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in loudspeakers, which almost all mobile phones have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music motives is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand kroner, one can have an already very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best telephones and the best equipped, also with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone manages to order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the control with that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. The Vodafone 527) generally has a slot for exchangeable memory cards (the M2 type, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you are not going to exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones do even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 kroons.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose more specialized walk-and-moped devices (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These apparatuses are provided with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the control is similar to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer life of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is provided by an MP3 reader produced by one of the marks mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not miss him for long.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz many times the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher at home than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's latest steps in the field of roaming charge regulation, there is a danger of paradoxical situation - SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic continue to be so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks competition that would really like to get into the fight.
This may sound paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this respect, Pavel Dvook, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who has stated on several occasions that in the Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network apparently no longer has much chance (by the way, now it would find only difficult frequencies).
Now, there is still a possibility--a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market which has led to a considerable fall in prices, which were to which conventional operators were to react subsequently as well.
Yet, even before the entry of troubled festivals such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could be a real success.
Moreover, we do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100 000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Let us add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which owns the U:fon in Thusha.
The advantage of virtual operators being the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they do indeed need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, free from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
For example, in the world, virtual operators are emerging as low-cost operators – they offer cheap calls and text messages, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in Britain at least half as much as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
'True men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust,' said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Vodafone's spokesperson Miroslav 'epick', he doubted: 'The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
All the more so as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
It seems almost certain, however, that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
'We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations are not very promoters.
Instead, the launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," said Mobil.cz Jana Studnykov, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not concealed, for long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl Group.
The future may therefore be promising.
From unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps welcome the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for the time being, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
'At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to others very specific.
For the time being, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr.e. of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrova says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: 'We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis.'
She adds: 'It is practically excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now."
Instead, Vodafone focuses its attention on fulfilling queries to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav zepick says in relation to this: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
That is what we believe means the most input from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet.'
The responsible authorities: in tune with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and thus a fall in their profit.
What, then, is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to understand themselves as thieves in fairs. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the T-T, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is reflected in the public information available from the web pages of the T.
Nowadays, however, the U:fon lends itself to serve as an argument so as not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova noted: 'Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators, the indifference of Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, it is not just a question of the attitude of the T, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately, has not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in economic competition.
It is the exclusive responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (AOHS).
However, the latter adopted its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been concluded at the moment, as the offer of the potential concerned has a priori not presented sufficient interest to the traditional operators," said in response to our question Kristiin Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the OHS.
A statement made in this way would not come as a surprise from operators' representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care, so that no one benefits from its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
All the more so since Kristion Chalupa adds: 'At a foreign level, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in the prices of mobile telephone services.'
However, exerting pressure on the honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not one of the interests of the company.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
Similarly, a price of gas exactly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and the hard battle of competition.
"The Office has not noticed any signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this respect, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even to the telecommunications regulator," said Chaloupa in its statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the "T" according to which telecommunications are, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has a fairly logical monopoly on its network.
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without accepting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the zOHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including the already mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they face similar constraints in the negotiations with all operators.
Overcoming responsibility on the T is a fairly common turn in communications, whereby the zh.S. washs its hands from the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to bring about the recent new generation of the telecommunications law, which has been adopted, to extend the powers of the "T-plus" in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the OHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently different.
When no one is watching, it can work
However, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operator, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but mobile telephone services are only partly public.
In most cases, it is about firms dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialised mobile telephone services are thus offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected representatives.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company is in front of the operator is a conventional business customer, who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As a major customer, it obtains special (and other) quota offers.
What is a problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
'If it happened what you are talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would examine and which could lead to a stoppage of the collaboration with the company in question,' replied our question about this problem, Martina Kemrov.
However, it is rather unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the managers of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
Auncun operator, however, does not act against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to genuine virtual operators, they do not in any way threaten them with their own official marketing.
The problems are mentioned as follows: 'The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary mobile operators' customers."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to the T.
In addition, another question arises at the zOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the company has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such activity, and if it does not want to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who say they have no idea that this would happen, as their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable fall in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators were trying, sometimes more and less so, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market that was too small or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies intervened in the developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators deal with this issue in the manner of a hot potato that is discarded by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But let's not throw away the sleeve after the bump.
If the slide information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear here, the Czech mobile market may be getting back on track.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult to remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) by others.
And we will perhaps stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolinek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov mj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jio Bolohlokek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a choir-like interpretation and an instrumental version.
The singing is provided by Katesina Knunkova and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremic and Jaroslav Krsek are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
The Czech national singing is considered to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously told the Czech public radio station, he chose singers' solo versions with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that one can understand the lyrics, let them sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The singing Kde domov m'j first resounded in 1834 on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlovaika (Kermesse des favotiers), Czech original piece by Josef Kajeton Tyl, accompanied by the music of Frantyek Okroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of the Checoslaovaquia in 1918, the first verse became naturally an integral part of the national anthem.
He remained one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pragonic Dopravno podnik (Pragonese Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about 100,000 people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day coupon (the latter will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card at the information points and the offices of the Dopravn podnik (Transportation Agency), located in the Muzeum, Muzhek, Nudra-O Hole-ovice, Andul, Roztyly, Let-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying coupons via the Internet on the web pages of the Dopravn- podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitely forget the counters in the subway stations, where they had hitherto to trample in long queues in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon via the Internet and they will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Mustska knihovna (municipal libraries).
'In these contact points, there is a ticket office with trained staff, who will help those involved with the purchase via the Internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have purchased on their card,' says project spokesman Martin Opatrna.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, they recall ticket composting machines and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budjovick, I metro stations. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska.
'Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,' added Opatrna.
An automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
Automatic machines that are going to work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
Namely, in peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are used mainly by the inhabitants of the communes of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
'In integrated trains in Prasko integrovano' doprava (integrated transport in Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;' explained the control of the Filip Drap tickets of the Ropid organisation, which designs the timetables for public transport operations in Prague.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's case.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
Thus, the driver checks the validity of registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," completed Dr. Pal.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which the validity of their coupon expires may rejoin the vending machines, which were initially used to record the coupons on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information concerning the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudetens called for a referendum in the US
Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that the United States should be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho-esk-v-deck-knihovna (The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the employers of the United States of America.
In 1945, some Sudeten German groups were allegedly addressing the President of the United States with such a desire.
This follows, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho-esk-Vodeck-Knihovna.
In the letter, Germans from Krumlov asked the US President not to allow the 'Surhizoster' (region of forests south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "Nobody, to whom the fate of the zumava is close to".
Given that the rallying of Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, unreliable attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter are asking the American President to take in his hands the protectorate of the zumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," says in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in the city, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the US, or to live under the employers of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to preside over that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them had such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the US and Britain to achieve a certain kind of autonomy for Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in the town of Budjovice, confirmed this.
During the war, he was, as a German of Budjovice, who was engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp of the Holstein region at the end of the war, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him for the Czech language.
'They believed that once back home, the Czech would be profitable to them,' said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war considered that, following the Bene decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You're not thinking - you pay.
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most costly road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterise the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament is of the opinion that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign, costing 150 million, will appear on television, on the radio, in cinemas, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast driving and driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
The slogan "bloody" of the whole campaign also bears witness to this:
You're not thinking - you pay.
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a blood puddle, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that you can pay for a moment of inattention for a moment's sake.
The spots will "host" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of accident victims.
It considers that this will lead to a reduction in the accident rate and in the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of drivers," says Martin Koon, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertisements, says the psychologist.
In his view, the panels that signal the danger to the drivers were already less effective.
'When a static panel warning against a danger is installed, it is likely to quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice,' says Koon.
Olmert would in exchange for peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, advocated the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
'We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all (occupied) territories, or even all,' says Olmert on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (from Israeli territory), since otherwise peace will not be achieved," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," remarked Olmert, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever who wishes to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to include 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he later stressed.
Retreat in the Golan Heights
Olmert also advocated the Israeli retreat from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Shia movement); they will have to give up the constant support they grant to Hamas terrorism (Shia movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to get colder
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India were not resolved, accused of illegal gathering of cockroaches in India, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg would result in a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister declared him today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
'If the problem were not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur,' he said after the meeting, following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on leaving the talks, that the executive branch had difficulty intervening in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr 'v'cha, who was discharged from the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, the case being placed under the latter's jurisdiction.
'His problem could be solved,' said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kusera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher body.
He could therefore request bail and await the judgement at liberty, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
'He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned,' said the Czech Foreign Minister.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicted persons with "competent legal support", mentioned the Indian minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been given to them from India.
"We want above all to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition continuing over many years.
The Indians also recognize him," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the company, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
'We regard the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great misunderstanding,' he said.
The minister diddraised the matter if he got India's promise to deal with the case.
'I have already received quite a lot of promises,' he said only.
Questions that arise after the accident: The stewards in the bus are they illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance bus is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, arises if stewards and passengers can travel inside the bus.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess perished, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the path of the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver at the time, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, the coach may have an accident, or even a sudden brake, also at the moment when the steward is serving the coffee shop or distributing the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its data sheet equipped with standing or not.
If this standing space equipment is not approved, passengers shall remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats; this has been confirmed by the director of the company Radim Janura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with the Ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet on the way on condition that they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - there is no legal requirement for this role.
On the other hand, there is also no legal requirement to prevent the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act is limited to the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds more generally the spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorna, the director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the issue.
"It all depends on whether the coach is authorized to propose standing places in its approval.
Everything lies in it," he said.
Coaches are divided into urban areas, where there are standing spaces and a limited maximum, interurban speed with standing positions and higher permissible speed and long-distance coaches without standing with the highest maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the airplane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hoon, a BESIP (road traffic safety) expert in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"When there is regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared with that of service in aircraft.
Here, too, it is not safe when turbulence occurs and the flight attendant can bump his head."
"Now, in the event that the coach had slowed down abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal requirements," he said and also felt that, from the point of view of the law, the problem had not been resolved.
Janura is ready to abolish these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer stewards services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a risky occupation.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I feel like it's a risky job, I'll do it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and diary at boarding.
It would also reduce costs,' he says.
The concern for safety is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles, the director of the Asiana Alexey Litvine, who, in comparison with SA, ensures a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses. We have been opposed to it from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in a fatal accident," he said a year ago in Toden.cz.
A huge tragedy has come
A young hostess from the Plzea region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably quit the emergency stop strip without using a blinker and blocked the way to the bus.
The latter's driver tried to avoid him by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he approached him by his right side.
Janaura refused to allow the two seats reserved for the stewards' rests to have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
In order to compensate the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgement, but as far as the financial compensation is concerned, it also relies on the guilty party.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could clarify the movements of stewards on board the coach.
"Now, it did not reach any conclusion on this point.
To tell the truth, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the system of points, at the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile phone while driving,' says expert Hoon.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger passenger safety," concluded spokesman Hanzelka, pointing out that the control of coach security is under the power of the police and the office for occupational safety.
A Czech arbiter the fight for the sea floor
It approaches an electronic wall map, which is depicted by Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent sea floor.
This area is, however, as large as the continent itself," said the Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty-person division of the United Nations Oceans and the Law of the Sea Affairs.
Its Chief, the Division's director, the Czech jurist Vaclav Mikulka, monitors the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardour at work and the enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found, but also uncharted living organisms for the time being, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger background than land
Coastal States have today begun to aspire vehemently to the new submarine territories.
According to a United Nations convention, they were using their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"For the sake of simplicity, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered as continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the 200 nautical miles that represent the exclusive economic yone,' Mikulka explains.
The country's request to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental shelf should be supported by extensive scientific-technical documentation, based on numerous prospecting and costly metreos.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical aid.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently been global.
The rest of the seabed, which was allocated to it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometres, the size of the country, multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in exploration.
The benefit they will derive in the future from seabed exploitation will be, as they project, invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, present their request.
They may do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by a convention entitled "Common heritage of mankind".
There, no State enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let us make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike", said, exaggerating Director Mikulka, adding that 'his areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract'.
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the former East countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States, obtained the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to be mined in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a kind of submarine replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Another jurist, "
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gave an example of such a concretion.
It is reminiscent of a small potato, or else, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The hopes of the Dusseldorf are based on Frankfurt.
The great words were not missing in the letter sent by the WestLB steering committee to the employees of the house.
Through a union of entities of the financial institute in Dusseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse financial group" could be set up, according to the letter issued public on Monday.
The WestLB would provide a "block of competence" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be a decisive start to other concentrations in the banks sector in the Federal States.
That is what it looks like when a boarding committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the wounded WestLB is still under great pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which only recently made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Westfalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of any kind between the Deka bank, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse from their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Admittedly, the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas announced when presenting the figures for the semester at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the house of Mainzer Land with a bank in Land, whether the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, half of which is supported and by the banks of the Land and Savings Banks, has instructed the Governing Board to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts thereof.
The talks, however, have just begun, is said to be in the financial sphere.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, comes into play when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a time that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
Nothing came out of this groaning bouquet.
No sooner had the plans been made public if the Government of the Land of Hessen ruled against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Thereafter, the other two houses did not meet.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with banks in the Land.
Finally, however, the chairman of the Hellaba's steering committee, Gunther Merl, had ruled against any commercial strategy to merge with his bank.
Apart from that, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election in the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a union of BayernLB with the Banque du Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could take place first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers were to increase, the possible partners are gradually eluded it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far been better at the crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringian Savings and Transfers, which owns 85 per cent of the Helaba's capital, instead issued a lock at the beginning of the year over any union with WestLB.
Would remain at the triciaf of NordLB.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely, by what business model the future capacity of the banks of the Lands should be ensured, had not hitherto been resolved by the German grouping of savings banks and transfers.
In the long term, a decing of the WestLb could take place, cutting which here is obviously not desired.
That was also what was discussed in the letter of the existing Executive Board: in any case, it would be a "comprehensive solution" for the establishment.
How this will all be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank is still to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, nearly a barrel of five-litre beer from the Kaiser brand, stands a well-built bearded bear on which to show about 200 visitors from the beer festival what deep sounds can be produced.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses start this evening at 23:45, 'destinazione Monaco', festa della birra', which is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are booked primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travels from Brazil exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing from their flag and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long mantle lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three rogues this year alone.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come back at 10:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Purity Law, health insurance and a head of the German speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are driving at night on the Autostrada in the direction of 'Brennero'.
There is no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything becomes quiet on the bus, the passengers sleep.
That is better, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be taken in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates once again take a break before Munich, on Highway 8.
When Marco's group finally arrives at six and a half as planned in the parking lot near the Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: hair on the little yellow cap.
Above is written on the left 'Beer Party', in Gothic, and next to the Internet address of the travel agency of Marco's 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'".
Second: 'When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,' Marco shouts in the early morning.
'Short-- 'Calm-- ' Run and reserve seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, you have to distribute them in the room.'
The chope, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instruction.
"Show the security guards that we behave well."
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone.'
Third: 'Tonight, to be back here at ten and a half hours pile.' Included?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the way, someone is tied yellow caps to the trees to find the way, the billboards and even an election poster of a large Bavarian people's party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'weekend of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; there are 50,000 who set out through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 per cent of visitors would have come from Italy on their own this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tirol policemen, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian red cross, which provides statistics on countries where the Italians occupy first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbriu brewery.
Insomnia nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister for Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word 'relative' and that he slips that the German banking sector would not be spared the crisis movements.
This one happened this weekend.
The finance of Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the DAX side, obtains a credit of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid funds are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public-law banks.
In the background, it is the daughter-in-size company Depfa that bears the losses.
According to a newspaper article, state finance had refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has since been possible because of the mistrust of the markets.
By the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 per cent to Euro2.37 million, and the equity interest rate had also slightly declined from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Ongoing and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it is only because of the large proceeds from the repayment of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern's companies that the deficit in earnings of about 16 per cent has proved to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier initially miscocked industrial mortgages, which were later filialized at Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then became more intensive in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter-in-chief, the Hypo Real Estate must make depreciation that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which is still quite unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
Already in 2007, they had been truncated by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has, since the takeover of Depfa, a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutes dependent on refinancing in the inter-bank market since it does not have any customer deposit.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks has again dried up considerably, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs part of the Depfa credit for a total of a short-term medium-to-size refinancing of the Depfa total.
According to a statement by the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing requirement is covered with the medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of the state of play at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Executive Board of HRE Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to use the medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Batin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors now have only to hope.
However, given the dynamics and imponderables of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its full scope.
But the opposite, too, cannot be ruled out.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the last press releases, still at the gates of insolvency on Sunday evening, this temporary rescue, at least, will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The stock price fell from 75 per cent to Euro3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of secondary loans are declining.
The most affected are, above all, the investment funds of the former daughter-in-chief Wurttemberg Hypo and those which, of course, have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be seen as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute that brought the crisis into the establishment through the takeover of Depfa Bank.
As long as issuing institutions, less affected governments and commercial banks are still prepared to support the system, a tightening of arrears can be assumed in time.
Or will happen what no one dares to expect at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the likelihood that approached security has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should set aside long-term nights of insomnia for long-term creditors on whether they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they drew on to be a carry-over of losses in the coming years on the next capital income tax on stock-earnings from automatically levied.
German special forces were on the ground for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the air squadron of the federal police and the Federal Criminal Police Authority, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk, were at the site of liberation.
As the Ministry's spokesman reported on Monday evening, German forces were not required, as the hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the impending release by force.
The Egyptian government reportedly accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the spot as a supporting force.
"There is fortunately not so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The assailants had abducted in southern Egypt the group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transbazed in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Chad and the Sudan.
The identity of hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as has the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the released hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus Airbus from the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up for the first day at Tachibana Highschool, girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii" so much.
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already the way to go to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana's Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn't get lost.
The start of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Pupils appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of the table begins with the teacher, the home room.
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not at all the kind of to like to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue rising socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I came to the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made bass masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him because of my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential for the survival of Japanese teens and means "cignon, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was properly assaulted.
Everyone was talking to who better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions -- in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all pulled out their Bentos.
My foster mother had also done me this kind of Lunchbox - that's really something other than the wretched German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look weird and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salty plums, brrrr.
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to do a little better the boy's knowledge during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I'm curious to know if I could see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I then always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
At the end of the day, reading manga, that's what I've enjoyed for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a soft spot for traditions, usages and customs.
And here, they're very important.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends -- on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
United States House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress narrowly derailed the 700-billion-dollar heavy-cope financial-market bailouts.
The Dow Jones was falling into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the United States House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of the President of the United States George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to stem the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the parties had desperately tried to convince opponents of the validity of this 700-billion-dollar heavy plan.
Barney Frank, a Democrat in the debates, called on MPs to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six per cent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors' concern that the state bailout could derail.
It went back a short time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the approval and the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach is leaking in the face of danger, does that mean that it also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how could we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it until now just as it cannot be proved that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or general consciousness, we enter lands that are difficult to pass because the hardware doesn't match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to transpose our experience subjective to that of animals.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral Cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least therefore for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being even differs from other primates.
Another significant feature could lie in the linguistic nature of man: much of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness in other animals may look like.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, to analyse on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily scientifically accessible.
Animal awareness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies of short-term primate memory, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: the two may or may not be the same.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualisation.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
So what we mean as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, like the reactions of the body) grabs grabbing the memory of the RAM.
Thus observed, the emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, combined with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the Cortex and brain stem body sensation areas, as does Jaak Pankseep, who is focusing more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be quite involved in cross-sectional sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that this cannot be overcome.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: how could we verify whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach is leaking by danger, but is it afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Admittedly, the nerve comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, cockroaches, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem at the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how could we demonstrate it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior of rats than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is being nervously pognated as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You could judge this as short-term, but I'd rather move forward than banging myself constantly against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government regards UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championships, in collaboration with Poland," Wasjunik announced.
"But it is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the deadline.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can no longer waste time.
We must work at the maximum speed", said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
'UEFA constantly has an eye on us.'
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Football League was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced independent director Robert Cawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a real danger that the P-PN will not be able to act properly", said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured in a letter to the President of UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were already convicted in the previous season for manipulating mandatory relegation; in the end, the beginning of the League had to be shifted at the last minute.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
When bookings are made in the coming months, according to one study, business figures have risen sharply compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 per cent.
Despite low economic prospects, the thirst for travel of Germans remains insatiable according to this study.
As regards reservations for the winter season, travel agents had a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as reported on Monday in Berlin by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures are already dominant in the autumn months.
For example, sales would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyses monthly booking data from 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the overall market.
Reservations for travel since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Because of the low dollar, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about one third.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Especially organised tours are in great demand, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of rising energy and food prices, costs would be " easier for the customer to be more commodified than for an individual organised trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early bookings or All Inclusivie offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very much retained, so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who have undertaken a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
Dennis Quaid outraged counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her private life in an interview – and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil over her adulterin Dennis Quaid.
He scum -- and counterattack.
A belated Rose war for ex-girlfriend Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are fighting an unsightly battle – in full view of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She is said to have become aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive of this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - is told the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as an infidel husband fell clearly: it would be "Monsters", said this one to the 54-year-old New York Daily News, that "Meg once again reappears the story of our relationship and manipulate it".
It would also be "regrettable", that "the pain and upheaval of divorce for every child be revived again in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
So was his response to the clawback: "In any case, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing the best."
Air and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established a sharp decline in profits in the first quarter after a rise in prices in the second quarter.
After hotel prices have risen for years, hotel nights have already been reduced to many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
However, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was clear, especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than 30 to 37 per cent earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar, which led to a "died urge for travel of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are held with a 26.3 percent increase, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was upwards in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy-class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were very fuel-intensive, had even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and in first class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would, on the one hand, be declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure on competition through the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg became the top of the rankings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still failed to find a functional eleven.
Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player did not return until late in the game and his shot failed against the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He simply knew that he was right.
'We need this second goal,' whistled Hermann Rieger in the locker hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was happening in the locker rooms, half-time was over and most had staleted in their place.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying a high reputation as many former protagonists.
That is why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquitted and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: let it jump with this second goal.
There was a lack of implementation.
"Not everything was very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later confessed.
Bastian Reinhard would have "desired also to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful headstroke by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players at Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121st anniversary on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday with no real party.
"We know how to take a step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the painting reflects more the unpredictability of the First League than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debonché of FC Bayern - is forming slowly, but it does not yet shine.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," demanded Jol.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann or Aafter-Ski hits continuously, beer in pitchers per litre and celebrities in zip-line design costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, a television presenter and wears a custom-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes at the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
Cheap Tyrolean costume seems to be achieving its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weiowurt equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was limited until now.
But once in the place of Thérèse, everything is half as much worse.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean costume or leather trousers; no one looks blasé or affected by shame - that's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume gets a few weird shots at the bumper-banana stand.
A Bavarian woman points out to me that I would have misattached my apron: "On the left means free, in the middle of the virgin, on the right, in the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my loop from back to left.
"It's better," she told me and laughed.
Others do not give themselves as much harm to these subtle techniques of flirtation and wear simple felt-tips, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed" and exposes us to their naked hiatus without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous," with an "oooooooo" lying down.
He tells me all this after he was relieved of the cup he had drunk before.
Directly next to this fire wagon that everyone believes is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild players."
Others don't get the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, heydays of rescuers run to the party square and have to look after the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This works for most of the visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back to a lot of it.
Those who lie in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarpaulin are not visible.
'These are the ones who can't swallow anything,' one of the rescuers shouts at me in response to my question and then disappears into the scrum.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the rescue package's failure caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little.
At around 8.30 p.m., the largest stock market index in the world was 10.579 points with a good drop of five per cent.
The Nasdaq Stock Exchange Index was at 1,548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
Bank Goldman Sachs shares fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue package, the means must be mobilised to purchase so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid in one go, but gradually.
In return, the State should retrieve options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged corresponding to the evolution of the price in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices aspirated in vortex in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investor concerns.
The stock price of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapsed and pulled the Dax downtown.
The US Dow Jones index is collapsing despite the government’s planned financial market bailout.
Dramatic declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The share of Bavarian real estate finance has permanently lost three-quarters of its value despite the federal government and private bank bailouts, Commerzbank has fallen by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped sharply below the large psychological mark of 6,000 points and 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, equity markets have come to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s 700-billion-dollar heavy bailouts could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,89.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of operation.
The United States House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout, and the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.
Other European stock exchanges also have been headed by one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has currently fallen by 3.2 per cent, with CAC 40 in Paris losing 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, Japan's main Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 after a start increase of 1.26 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped by 2.1 per cent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 per cent, and closed to 12,595.75 points.
In MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after an increase in capital was announced.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of fuel conductions soon to be frozen, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers – the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, whereby they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
In this way, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has been surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of how it is expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
'Dibery could be responsible for this anomaly, a matter that is also close to the Earth,' he writes.
Space researchers have known about the existence of dark matter for only about ten years.
Apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is to say it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter is still a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnailers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the collimators of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE is the most important cases.
Pictured European tourists in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was communicated by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are in the process of checking their state of health,' said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well and safe, and the National Television of Egypt announced.
The 19 participants in the desert excursion are expected to be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages are still unclear: for example, the kidnappers were reportedly close to ending the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without warning.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,' the agent said.
All that remained was to take the hostages, when suddenly "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom from Germany worth six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had found a safe road to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this narrative.
Accident victim identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of a father-in-law" who led to suicide"
One court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornish, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
Truro's high court referred that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years of age.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
As a child while living in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer with National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 to "emotionally dead", and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's father-in-law, who had also written a letter of confession which ended as follows: "I regularly attached him and bandage him".
"I didn't sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what was even more astonishing is the fact that if she had not made this gesture, her story would certainly never be over in court."
He added: 'I emphasize in particular, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office's ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC knew.
The Ministry of Defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent, Frank Gardner, stated that this episode had a lot of the people in Whitehall.
"They thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office cabinet", he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Secret Services Associate Committee
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies in the face of the invoice B-B.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than EUR 80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided USD 14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford and Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savers' money, including 59 construction companies.
The Managing Director of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, has said that it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots...
The loan of USD 14 billion will be repaid when the Bradford and Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited every year to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is claimed that each company has to pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to EUR 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find EUR 81 million to pay the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Managing Director of the Trade Committee of Construction Companies, told the BBC that he felt this decision unfair.
It is 'irritating' to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously when the housing market is picked up now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
"we need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options for avoiding the need for construction companies and their members to pay for this savoury bill", said Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, it will be necessary to pay the interest of the entire year, which could double.
Since construction companies are organizations without a shareholder, their members end up paying the bill either through higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey had thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, 20 steps perhaps, from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha Station was designed in a Neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its corners, such as some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the arched ticket office, we have no more doubt about the grandeur of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions for domination thanks to this railroad that is coming to Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, created by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and empire forces advanced in addition to Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say that this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail route to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serve to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy of engagement.
The Turkish Government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed-wagon to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half journey, shaken on noisy rails whose old world was reminiscent of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I was finally arriving in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning its back to its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stones and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and many pastries in which middle managers in suits-tie men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a center-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now it has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with both of them.
She had to do both.
"but now, at some point, 'I asked if' should Turkey not choose?".
"Turkey" said he "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I was able to talk to me with, recited me by heart: the Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, is therefore as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to be drawing a Europe that travels metaphorically on track to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought back to these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could, for the most part, be in Turkey’s hands.
As I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosporus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been named 'the sick man in Europe'.
At least, there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Milk increases up to five penny per litre
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pennys per litre, starting on Monday.
This is the second price increase, which follows a two-year increase in February, and comes as a result of research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers have to decide whether they are going in turn, increase the price to consumers.
. Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last varied, in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh dismissed a bail request from ex-MP Sheikh Hasina, who may be arrested on her return home.
His lawyers said that the court refused to give him bail because of his indictment for extorting from a businessman, 50 million Taka (a 72,900) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many accusations made against him.
Khaleda, Sheikh Hasina's continued rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because, if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she does not require bail as she had been allowed abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the military interim government assumed power, but was released in June to seek foreign treatment.
Sheikh Hasina, as 'haleda 'ia, deny the accusations against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign for Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
However, she stated that she did not manage to contact the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesperson stated that this had happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's legal battle
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The committee stated that, in the past, MSkyB's involvement had prevented competition and had enabled it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV shares cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, thereby encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, was excessive – especially since BSkyB had just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. prosecutors case.
The US Attorney General appointed a Special Accusor to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born out of the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and the former Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers, who maintain that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Acknowledger, Nora Dannehy, will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Serious accusations of potentially criminal conduct, unsubstantiated, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the delisting in December 2006 of nine U.S. Attorneys' Attorneys by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors had been dismissed for poor performance.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute a political connotation to these layoffs.
Some prosecutors have been accused of being close to the Republicans in Congress, while others are said to have refused to investigate accusations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the judiciary for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up being accused of being involved in the dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales in this case, stating that he considered him "primarily responsible" for these redundancies, and ends up "abdicating" his leadership role," remarkably succeeding not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, is scheduled to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic vocals Bat Out of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album hit.
The award night is presented by Coldplay, with this year a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a loud voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, peaking at number 15.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained on the English charts for nine years, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heartbeat that has become irregular, after having collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal chords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon in Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of them.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide 120 in length, it resembles a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. There are no signs of the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to re-apnight Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcuts simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development in the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Neighbourhood Owners' Committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay sketched a proposal allowing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to submit next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
'They could propose to restore and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.'
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to take over the small street and set up seats there, some of which would be used by a café to which the manufacturer will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"the main interest of Avalon Bay is to redesign this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, pointing out that it was the city to suggest the sale to her.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wished to sell the street, further emphasizing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been with this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this little piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The later entrance to the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution to luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be plunged into peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Wordly Look Nostalgic on A City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and louvers, full of newspapers of the past week flying along the gutterers."
With few exceptions, the street always has the same speed.
A rat shaky runs at the back of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by have only rarely suggested that Extra Place think, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on the other hand, said he believed that some people underestimated the appeal of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were unfolding in dark, damp and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision Programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you thought. Why should the middle classes be able to choose their school? "
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama points out that "African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."
In order to combat these differences, the education programme of Mr. Obama particularly supports, among many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those learning English.
But the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English, is in addition to his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern part of Los Angeles.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and from low incomes.
More than one third of the students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Among the CM1 students, 100 per cent passed the 2008 Math State Examination, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students took the English-language-of-thearts exam.
This incredible success was achieved with an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of the Sixth Street, this school introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion."
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you wouldn't have had any chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us"
Mr. Shouldn’t Obama take the Sixth Street Prep as an example and replicate it in other schools, mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama.
Although he was in favour of the fact that immigrants learned English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, 'you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish.'
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, so he should look carefully at the patterns of education that work, rather than disdain or consider them insignificant.
Oil Falls following the New Concerns of the World of the Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the bailout for financial marches will succeed in bringing the economy back to life.
Crude oil-exchange transactions fell by 7 per cent to 99.80 dollars per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, at this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shattered by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After an increase of 145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost 90 dollars per barrel this month, before rebounding again to the deep uncertainties of financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the deal on the bailout plan, the biggest in history, concluded this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis is severe.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have in part nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have said that this weekend's frantic negotiations concluded with the rescue agreement "would not seem to have managed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
"the foresight of global equity, interest rates and market exchange, has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"we believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
Bank analysts narrowed their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were forced to fall by 20%, with the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The Feast of the Second Determining Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second step began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played naked under obscure clouds.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor of an afternoon when their relationship leapfrogged.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from half-time.
"I didn't leave my area" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
As Favre and Coles played wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and yarded 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens's balloon, might well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets were able to score in a time.
"The Jet coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said, "the second time or the third?"
When he was told both - the Jets missed 21 indisputable points in the third time - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third time.
." Many points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpassed its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of her title as the best long-distance runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, thus becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 in an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie broke his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, played last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record in his superb career, during which he won the World Championship or world record for any distance, of the 1600meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps exaggerated today, that air pollution will increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions-sunky weather, 48 degrees at departure, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, maintaining an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Runway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted into long-distance runners, have contributed to the decline in the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffering from clamps in the calf two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that rest has allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back on it last week, and today I had my doubts; but at the end, everything went for the better."
He was blamed mostly in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia – for orchestrating his races too much, avoiding the world’s marathon stars, actually relying on hares as if they were in track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's abilities as a long-distance runner.
On Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the lead-in-headedness disappeared.
A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final comeback to detach from Kwambai, which finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal best by five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year achieving the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her personal best by almost five minutes at her third marathon.
She ran a skilful strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a nice advantage, then overtaking them about 18 miles 1/2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City of Parts, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black city to be integrated, the childhood home of Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to do today." The city in the five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison".
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer in the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes has become touristy thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide edited by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project - remains a special place.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston recounted that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows so little, does not know what he is losing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious in the eye of the foreign eye.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident of the city's longest-standing Parish.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of almost 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of a black rural southern culture--some times disdained, other times acclaimed - reminiscent of the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville, who was born with the name of the city, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the often forgotten center of Florida that ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious as a heavy drum in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, M. Joe Clarke, who was later divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she writes, "you'll find the modern public school brown and white, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read and write.
She also referred to the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by the passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also for literacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
"Dr. Dinkins, 90, said one of Johnson's young girls, whom Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty."
She added: 'some people did not like it'.
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in the city without warning, in a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing trousers here, where even today we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, as many people mocked her.
"People were always happy to see zora," he said.
But he added, swinging in his chair of the posterior patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a star in literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world, "said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to move a five-lane highway to the city, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's main street two-lane.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixing of races led hatred to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young whites came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady even died. "
They threw a watermelon from their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education, insulting rather than glorious of my race."
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and has weakened the confidence of young people.
"Black kids used to be kissed -- I remember that -- we kiss our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Widow of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
It lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white -- I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have made it possible to create space for many other Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, as well as, armed with a joyful self-confidence and guidelines such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began struggling to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduced it to American guns.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous girl regained her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of the highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the cottage rejected the proposal of the motorway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride", said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole thing stating that "Sora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents were beginning to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A single-themed library (known, of course, Hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repainted.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today we have 90 percent blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover Eatonville's history, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things--like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields--must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a brave teacher with a soft drink, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, due to the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people in particular, tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, bosses, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is indeed sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger people, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think, oh, this city hasn't compared anything to others," Alondra Kenon said after mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to look at the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, they're all fluent in finance.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the booth and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in glass and beethrottle offices above their head, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "work day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
Deliverers continue to sneak onto the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos always hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke arranged on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go and open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work in the late afternoon, because I was discovering at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's counters, nor to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked the management for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal keeper," all lined up for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that they say that treat customers as their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of 327 dollars has used the liquidator, and as New Yorkers are returning home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth 440 million dollars, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and shop employees in front of me, frightened by another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that does the most rescue on Wall Street.
Any New Yorkers have become very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I was hearing a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her meagre general manager Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable dealer.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I have put all my savings in the MMF market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take risks."
Memorials by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include the under 21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old - refused to abandon the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and skill of the choir to manage any type of music was presented to him, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod was telling us to "let music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants"
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing."
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, it was raised much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them has ever disappointed me- and, a few times, they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley held this combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his view, "focus only on certain people".
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history, in Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD".
That's what comes from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Norman Hugs, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
Muslim tons desecrated as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the "cities against Islamization" organisation in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red striped mosques.
The police accuses extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of the far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; according to the police, an organized action is.
The criminals painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; detectives, however, believe that this could have been done to disguise the extremists' feelings of hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the elections?
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community said that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan, which was coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, waged an anti-immigrant campaign. Some of their slogans were even, according to critics, considered xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from travelling abroad.
Courts have banned glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, expatriation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a ban on Glitter for six months, after he had expressed his intention to visit Spain via France.
The Kent Police had granted the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or by his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at Ashford's limited courts, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "Thursday, 25 September, at the Ashford Court, the Kent police have called for enforcement to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd traveled to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not here then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if it means being registered in the lists of accused persons of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wished to go abroad for more than three days.
It must also inform the police, 7 days before its scheduled departure date.
If he did not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years'imprisonment.
The Kent police stated that they would not discuss specific cases or Glitter's potential displacements in the matter.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect our children and those from abroad.
'In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices that can handle any potential risks, much more effectively.
"protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
. Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 years respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he would have had to board a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him by passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to allow him to enter their territory, and were therefore forced to return to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, was on duty at the Uxbridge, West London, court of limited jurisdiction for it on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for possession of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his character"
No heels, no hills.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen eyes artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Gunther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some staging with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less well-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Mois de la Photographie Fleender, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the audience.
To capture moments of the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a character of their own.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the moments of personality of flamenco stars."
With the "Sing Popular du Mines" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, remember the classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "Music with very traditional roots that evolve and that surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing per se, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and magic was the constant of this work that we present these days at the El Fotatta gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collecting portraits on display at the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, know them and be able to enter their lives for a more or less long time.
I think in photography portraits are the most difficult genre.
You're in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or who only leave you for a few minutes so you can take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try that my ideas become reality."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the Galerie El Fot-mata, located at number 20 on Rue de la Mata (a street parallel to the Peuplerai d'Hercules) which will be open until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The favorite at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel currently occupies it "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parading in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "City and Dogs" was the most anticipated figure in the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by a majority of the participants' votes, topped the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated audience that did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "live new experiences"; how he wrote with a "very methodical work"his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that she "has effects" and "makes less similar people", because writers were asked "not to indulge in frivolity" and to take on their vocation.
Bad weather ruins the Pozoblanco fair
The party of the banderillas that concluded the bull races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horseback riders checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferman Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather took a hard time on this fair, as in the end two parties out of three could not have taken place.
On Saturday, it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the planned second bull race.
On the bill, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro D'az y Juan Bautista, who should have clashed in the Castilblanco arena.
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two warps planted on the baton's back and a cut ear that the open steps applauded more than his fight with the bull himself.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without difficulty or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police screening of a van in Alava province: two thousand kilograms of hashish found
Five hours minus 10 in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) on the border of the Municipality of Armanin (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two are initiating the escape.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armian.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the control began.
The policemen began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the aisle, where the two occupants had descended to flee to a wooded area.
The Basque policemen finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bundles. They then proceeded with the transfer to a police station for a comprehensive inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, the staff members found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the registration plate written on the van registration card, which is also why they attributed an offence of forgery of documents to the detainee.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate the other suspect, who managed to escape and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A. A. D., aged 28, has been taken into custody to carry out the various procedures and will be judged within the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving as a medicine
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her do strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California Police Patrol, who revealed to the People Review.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "looked up on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rolled over her sunglasses".
Soon after, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and exited his vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the officers took her to the drug and alcohol centre to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol abuse was ruled out from the outset, although "according to the observation of the police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested being suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated at around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was taken out of the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat herself with a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares requested the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of Parliament for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today said that it was the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of receiving preferential treatment to his family members.
'In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organisation that will have to shoulder its responsibilities,' said Llamazares with regard to the political party's behaviour which he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left has called for investigations to be "transparent" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party had "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Bath of Mayo", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdos, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarraa at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "Bangre de Mayo" will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdus' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have made with this filming "a childhood dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May Madrid, something he always accepted when the story stood by the national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Madrid Commune is for Garci a 'unique opportunity' to reproduce with the appropriate settings and clothing the atmosphere of 'a Spain who has mistaken as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions during the reign of Ferdinand VII', he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not obtain funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Gum of Goya" - more than double the one obtained for "Sangre de Mayo" - because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc-rcel, with whom he collaborated for most of his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to repeating before starting filming and to whom he does not casting, since it seems to him to "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Bath of Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellon, Carlos Larrasaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar's candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de Mayo", "Seven French pool tables" and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which should deserve to be better known", he said.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a price.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayon puts herself in the skin of the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer will pay tribute to a also Sevillane dancer.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in Oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and argued for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe in the interwar period, fascinated Isabelle Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed that I play the Sevilla dancer Tortola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban popular dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will again sing Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with her student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I'm happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me."
The staging was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesus Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Moron; the percussion of El Pajaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juarez, "who plays the role of the perconomy of the
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in such distant places, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
'I wanted to remember her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and highlights her work,' says Bayon.
The show will start at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre

"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition 'the Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted me the attention of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exposure that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently Married Poet" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramon Jiménez married zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008).
In this way, the "Trinat zenobia and Juan Ramon" comes to an end with the re-publication of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramon Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after having travelled to the various andalous provinces, will go to the various andalo provinces.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought 800 copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America less likes without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice," and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar
It had not been in operation since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a blow to everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence."
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of film and homeland died during a particularly obscure period, when terrorists and stock markets are scary, the American esteem fell very low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and unforeseeable to live, there is only nothing left to human beings to be admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his elder death following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to either nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set us the bar high," noted George Clooney, who may be the only one today who is trying to pierce the screen as Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there's the one who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married 50 to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even if he was not short of the opportunities not to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?", was he used to joking.
In heaven, he happily meets his daughters with his fans on earth, something that's not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympic Games race
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can hold Olympics, after failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not.
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be subject to a playoff note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
The mistakes start with the removal of the bibs, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for shopping).
Well, no
They were only going there to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What world are we living in?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy only small jerseys with less expensive fabric and so?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on racing day.
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, it is necessary to leave one's backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we hadn't yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place by the shack.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which I think did not mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this would certainly not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to the company's campus) in response to what was asked of it in a conversation.
Through a camera and a system of shape and face recognition, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are -- including remembering what positions they occupy -- and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group who is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance, but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome was the first step on Google to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be needed as it is the necessary basis for understanding the hardware and software.
It occupies the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operational system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who are half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can be the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, congested months, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, indeed, and I'm showing you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft's employee rest rooms in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso stood on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Cwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola''s 'The Godfather' and is part of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we start to list all its appearances, we could also cite this heavy shit that raised weights in a travelling circus.
It's not just a simple cotton, molding, sleeveless male body jersey.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the best-known body jerseys have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tanks tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton trousers, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will begin commercializing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new mono-volume has an even wider interior space.
Added to this is a few refined mechanics, which increase the driving comfort and make it possible to save more fuel.
A change in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it should be stressed that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the launch of the first generation.
First of all, it can be seen that Honda has renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less well known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Specifically in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
For example, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazzs in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to make up for much of the fall in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand managers hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a 16% drop in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, a share of 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be in the United States, while the remaining other half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (an additional two centimeters) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change 1.52 meters.
The dimensions also increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a petrol reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk – which has a double bottom system – can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L trunk is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to rear seats.
Doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, coming down to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol props.
Both engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, making the engine more powerful and increasing engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine developed a power output of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz was 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propellant, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new fashion business very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but as well as at the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish company sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the '50s and '60s enchants us and we draw a lot for our collections.
I love walking around the city and watching women to see how they're dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I think so, but at the end of the day everything is being joined, and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was very young, I had been enjoying clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look into my aunt's cupboards and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of the way I dress.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the acting actress, when you take on clothes, that's when you're really putting yourself in the character's shoes.
As a result, everything is linked.
You did not long ago, 30 years ago: Was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s rejoice me.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and savors life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a little bit and it gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I'll do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Now to the movies, you're waiting for the various movies you made last year.
It's true, I can't wait for them to go out.
I, who is a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait to get out the movies 'La'ltima hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo'.
See what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that.
I didn't get on the walkway to model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell has called me, I have known her for quite some time, inviting me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association for supporting women and the clothes we were exhibiting - I displayed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People Naomi is a soft-hearted person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things aren't true.
Moreover, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
The 'bead car' which avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has drawn inspiration, this time, from nature, in particular bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating bee theft, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. made this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Research in Advanced Science and Technology at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General for Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Mark Management, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Security Shield.
This robot will allow the branded vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan security shield.
But the most important is the bee-compound eyes, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers developed what is known as a laser lock (Laser Range Finder).
The latter detects obstacles which are over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At the moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by switching its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and main engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards or diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions such as bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device must only process information and act according to this data.
It does not need to keep the information or the intuitive logic of prior maneuvers, which is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen memory KBs.
It may surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This represents the first development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in production cars in a decade or so after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Driving drinker repeaters will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for blood alcohol to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the driving-up from being started, or if he is not blowing.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered to be a one-year pilot project.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 per cent of motorists arrested for driving drunk more than once, take over the car.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the start of the vehicle if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the authorized one.
Its cost is more than EUR 1 000 and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65 per cent of infringements in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out by ordinary channels but, however, the reform carried out by penal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system on school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17:40, on the official time scheduled, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juarez Airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of setting but its rays still forced to put their hands on the visor to see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street whether he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official journey.
- Ah, all right, so we won't be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or...?
- No, no sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
Several of them waited in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing through the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the city's four largest hotels, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
They're afraid of being mortgaged
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say, 'Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The dismal aspect of this dwelling, and especially of the Master of the Hotel, leads us to think several times if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but unmet detailed information.
It's more of a game for teenagers.
"What if the game ends?"
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
The most prestigious prize in fashion
Surely there is no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is surely no more extraordinary and boner draughtsman living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of EUR 300 000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian, who won the first edition, watched her models in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Admittedly, it is the second largest department store in the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square metres of surface area.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, meant that we found ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having a big on the heart and making good-hearted bad fortune, because of her brother's recent death, Nati put on a garment of Mango and some elders of ELAH, which took breath away, and arm over it, arm in arm with her son Luis – a handsome man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as Baron de Rotchil finished the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with trousers and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphosed by taking a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remember the good old days.
Inés Sastre did not stay for visiting the palace outbuildings, but she showed us before on her cell phone pictures of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martinez – another handsome man who is riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there should be no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they're all listed in a book that will bring relax to booksellers on September 30.
The alarm clock almost sads us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think about the restless rhythm that current life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquillity in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' insanelys such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help relax.
If adrenaline doesn't run through your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from its mind and focus on reading.
Sleeping
A few children speak during the night.
I don't relate to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Sure there's more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence
They are often linked to other sleeping alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enureas (paeping in beds) or sleepwalkering, but this is not always the case.
As we said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stress or overexcitation situations.
Anyway, it's a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with cries, crying, long speeches ...
In the event that somniloquia becomes very common, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We said that this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another altered sleep that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnoea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid more or less violent programmes or television series.
With children who are very nervous and have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to remain calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if you are very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because by sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thoughts.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to the way in which you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interview him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing very bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally returned to the path of victory on his field after a long period of starving.
Without a big game, the Yellow and Blacks created the greatest number of occasions and managed to turn one for the winnings of the game.
The pace was not very high during this meeting, where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visiting captain Kauffmann who was approaching the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
Opposite, we were blocked in the middle of the field and just left the Riahi stirring at the tip of the attack.
The beginning of the second half would be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball repelled on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the striker Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of this and will not pose major problems to an Illutunous Eleven who has just retreated a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big muddling, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Britain.
Faced with the show of force by the fishermen who severely disturbed the attacks of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the 'crisis committee' set up by Breton fishermen to obtain measures to deal with the soaring gas oil prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the employment and remuneration conditions of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to leave off by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île pas stopped.
A filter barrier has been launched on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and the English Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at the dock, or in Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique stopped in the evening the blockade of the large Total de Donges refinery.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting was held at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned interview at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up anything" and "do not want to move to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the break-even point of a vessel is only reached with a diesel fuel of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer, at the age of 83, in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes praised film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that lie on the global economy.
The world's fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the .85 billion dollars that has been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, according to the newspaper, which cites sources close to the case.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to divest include its international leasing subsidiary Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Respondent Transatlantic Holdings and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision was taken on these assignments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay the Federal Reserve’s 85-billion-dollar loan at the risk of US authorities taking 80% of its capital, deluciting by the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris Historical session Morning Meeting Historical Meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange hit a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-oriented Nasdaq index sold 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the extended standard and Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street sunk after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank bailout, which was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market is counting on this,' she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days would come 'too late'.
"If the project is indeed moribund... then the relay will be quickly transferred to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, 'every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution' to the United States, said Ms Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated suddenly, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not just a US crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill fell to 3.632 per cent, from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year return to 4.161%, compared to 4.357 per cent the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into the table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's largest bank, which will pay nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp fall in its stock market.
A week after unveiling a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley ordinary shares at a unit price of USD 25.25, for a total amount of USD 3 billion.
The price used shall be 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10 per cent and a conversion price of USD 31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of USD 29, or 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% at USD 23.07 at around 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of holding bank," said John Mack, the CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but takes it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about '8.5 billion dollars.
"One week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, "we thought that the stake would be made entirely of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley 7% securities below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferential instruments into ordinary shares in one year if the latter are traded more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at approximately USD 47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assured that MUFG's capital would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokeswoman for the group refused to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "significantly" eased his record since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been trying for the group, which has seen its stock market price half meltdown as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt is soaring.
The cost fell back on Monday but remained at a high level of around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had raised 15 billion dollars, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Rebuilding the republic around socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third that put a draft of the new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted 'yes' in the referendum, according to official results on 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were nil and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a count from a non-governmental organisation had announced a large victory in the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution triumphed out", he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales, but also his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which was conducted peacefully according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the President's "new socialism".
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving for it the "planning of the development" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
Carried out by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who may serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to introduce in the country of 13.9 million, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner of the points of the first television duel
On Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates followed another one, who, by John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, was not "brittle" enough to stop his decline in presidential polls at five weeks.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% to McCain), believes that it was the Democrat who got his way.
Among the undecided voters, who mattered, Obama came out the winner for 39% of respondents, while 25% gave McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It has good instincts," Bill Clinton warned, however, this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain has repeatedly highlighted his indisputable foreign-policy experience, while pointing to his opponent's "naiveté" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused has repeated several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack has been hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, yes," a Democratic spot recounted this weekend, recounting a Republican reproaching the Republican for not realizing the full extent of the impact of the crisis on the "American in the street."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday to 20,000 people to congregate for an election rally in North Carolina in heavy rain.
He did not even say the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial rout clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most likely to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a turning point," said yesterday, influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Renewing that he would still succeed in reducing taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite the upheavals of Wall Street, the Senator from Illinois also pointed out that achieving the country's possible energy independence by promoting renewable energy was its top priority, with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates have evaded questions about the 700 billion dollar (470 billion euros) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "you noticed that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents were demonstrating on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening as soon as polling stations closed in Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: 'the dictator, resignation'.
Some people admit that they did not even vote: 'What good, since they will do what they want with my voice,' said one young person.
They do not believe that the regime that has made foreign observers good in order to re-read the language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning point.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were considered specific by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept out of the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting", lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkevich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the voices, and in our country is executive power.
If opposition deputies enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe following the electoral process will recognize the validity of the elections.
She stressed that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the right to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you? asks the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition Members in Parliament, the ones that best suit the power."
The silence of the night falls back to the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the captains of the eleven tourists and their eight accompanying persons captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back on Monday afternoon to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at about 3.30 p.m. on a special plane at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without speaking to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, zoheir Garanna, on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the outskirts of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one cache to another by 35 unknown captors.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, safari organizer.
An Egyptian security official reported that 30 special forces, who had been launched on board two helicopters, had launched the assault on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others running away," said the official who asked for anonymity.
He reported that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces from Belgrade.
'We have to recognise that we have achieved this through the professionalism and efficiency of our people in the secret services, special forces,' he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle in a patrol carrying the captors, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and stopping two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Uniting (SLA-U), which this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is on the headlines and is in the current election campaign.
So much the better.
But one sector of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the pleas in poverty that is given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French Government is spending three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle alone in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, it is stated in the Constitution of their country that heritage protection is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, elected representatives and all government departments, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with excavating history, preserving with three under private archival heaps and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they often who are the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our forgotten old stones and cemeteries.
When will there be a platform for history and heritage?
Interview - Blood returned to safe
Haéma-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Most importantly, it regained public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood supplies managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public lorry, the Government of Canada established a public inquiry in February 1994, presided over by Justice Horace Krever, which sought to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to ensure that such a disaster did not recur.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Dr Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field in the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said, proudly stating that in early 2008, nearly 94 percent of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases in Europe of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which tells the one that has been holding the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was then based on one of the main recommendations, according to which, when it is not known and a serious disease can result from this, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterised by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death, measures of exclusion are introduced.
In April 1999, blood was therefore denied to persons who had resided in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
However, a few years ago, it was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense."
In 1999 a much more sensitive technique for testing for HIV was found on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests, which make it possible to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used hitherto were based.
TANs have shortened the silent period, which extends between the moment when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period may have been reduced to less than one week.
The risk of some donors being infected without knowing this has been substantially reduced and that they cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV.
'In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hama-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, this will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product.
I believe that we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health,' says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just later, last year appeared on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant", Dr Décary continues before pointing out that, in addition to security supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
"Needs are rising because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to recharge red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the network of blood donors, which accounts for only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.'
However, any healthy person who is 18 years of age and older who meets the eligibility criteria may give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
'With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
As today's life is so unbridled, there is rarely time to spend an hour donating blood," Francine Décary docks.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
We should start offering them for transplants early next year,' says Dr Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed not to have access to it", because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL's first division playoffs, thanks to a 3–1 (4–3 goal win) over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the goal-turnarounds in the total goal stage at Saputo Stadium.
Middle field Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a first half aimless on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2–1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3–1 deficit in the return game to win 4–3, but the Whitecaps still rose to the final round 5–4 in total.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's victorious goal
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to undertake the season.
The unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win over the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the game, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev had a pass in this win, the fourth in the Tricolore in six pre-season matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the sole goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest on the North
Prime Minister does not rule out elections before the end of the year
Earlier the General Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon yesterday in Quebec City, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Reply the limits of our last great frontier in the north": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining broadly, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of Moulin à images.
Rotated in a loop, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as well as during electoral periods.
In the press point, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the possibility that he would call for the elections this autumn, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was 'a gem with immense potential', but did not give a maturity, investment amounts or a specific priority in future projects.
At most, a few avenues of what could be further developed: hydropower, forestry, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to M. Charest.
This "territory twice as big as France," "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it's in us,' he insisted, as if to make it clear that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up much of its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
'It's up to us, it's our future,' he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government", he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the Territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ) of Ungava, have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, 'not necessarily a summit', but a time when 'one will give oneself a common vision'.
The development of the North would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.
The Plan Nord will be 'concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of former Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded him.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed to rename the Centrale Beauharnois to the Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, in Bourassa who made James Bay, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press point, he invoked another reference, curator this one, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Approaching the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, M. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It stays between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, raising applause at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling a ballot this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
He pointed out that his schedule was however fulfilled, notably by a mission of the Federation Council to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council at the end of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which went as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that the latter had the right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of Plan Nord have been sceptical.
The Chief EQF, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Development Policy of Nord-du-Québec, which the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, had given up on applying it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois together with her candidate in Jean-Talon (straitor that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ supported the adoption of a Northern Plan by the Government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonoured country
That's Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (o irony) in Harper's cabinet, which allowed herself last summer to say to Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To dismiss the stigmatization of this woman who has fought a relentless struggle for justice and deserves our admiration says as long on the Prime Minister's entourage as Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A Government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent at the time of the charges against him.
The only Government that, despite the fact that Canada had signed the Geneva Convention, denied its word and left a child soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be recalled, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to receive a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing at the moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the word that Harper keeps brandishing and sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Now is the time when no morality can ever exist: you can bully, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the will of a minority head of government (what will happen after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its 17 September edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Senior Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Continuing Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company sued six million for three authors and a small, penniless publishing house, with the aim of launching a "transparent public debate".
While it was true that judges were independent and impartial, it was not the truth they tried, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally conducted through the exchange of ideas and not through truncheons.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open their books, their files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support for Black Canada authors as a perdu the hand.
Perhaps Mr. Could Garver explain how he can both request a 'public' debate while disregarding the views of the same audience?
In the vice-presidential world, it seems that this word refers only to grtuating lawyers and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so above all because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is prepared to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a gag prosecution (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a letter with a letter to Blacks Canada authors urging them to cease using this term...).
Beyond the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the search for truth, which is essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to summon copies of credible sources and to the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are unpleasant to the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, on pain of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
It has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been known to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to academia, as is to public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms that limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Get Ridge
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the USD 700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It provides, inter alia, for better control by elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new arrangements to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, and a right of control over the salaries paid to the directors of rescued companies.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards a market-effective understanding," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done in such a way as to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"That's the fundamental point: if we don't do that, the trauma, chaos and disruptions to Americans' daily lives will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had sprinted in the last few hours for fear of the effect that another failure would have on the mood of investors.
The limited time agreed was the opening of markets this morning.
Assumed late in the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather in favour of the understanding, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction that one was forced to arrive at that end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added certain provisions to the agreement, including allowing homeowners to hold their homes and on the salaries of government-suppressed company executives.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be welcomed.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
Asked about another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad outlines I've read that it's something that we're all going to have to digest and with which we're going to be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back the bad debts, risky and unsaleable assets of US financial institutions with taxpayers' money.
After 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that initially led to the collapse of sub-prime mortgages before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze on liquidity and the disgress of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft of the deal last week.
It is believed that they have emerged from this impasse since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round up the angles for everyone in Congress, it was also added a provision stating that if the government were to face losses for five years with that programme, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which another EUR 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be approved by another congressional vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington will win stakes in the rescued companies that will earn dividends in the event of a profit that it can resell when the turmoil is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay the foreclosure procedures for housing attached to the housing loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and severance pay paid to the directors of the companies affected.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, there continued to speak out against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratic sides.
"Obviously, Washington can't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that benefits from taxpayers."
A leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed "the caucus of sceptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to say to us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to look carefully at the way to go,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up its competitor in full sinking since it lost EUR 2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) in the crisis in risky mortgages in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, a voting right is regained in the bank and influence.
This is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalising another bank that had been plagued by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from the Bank of Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion (USD 75.5 billion) of home loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second largest bank, after Northern Rock, which the British government is expected to nationalize since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was long his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a springful talent will also have him moved away from the power register that gives birth to true sacred monsters.
But what a great in-depth runner.
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American film in good years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the break-up of dramatic conventions.
Miced blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without disproportionate ego, the ultimate brand of quality.
For in him projected to a whole country loving self-made, the combated Pacific war fighter, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then frequented the New York Actor's studio, before triumphing in the theater, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who worked for civil rights was also the racing driver who placed second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret, discreet, engaged star, allergic to the splinters of show business, whose puzzles are not quite unravelled.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance gave cinephiles vertigo this weekend, as his great roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh ever-changing American art marches through it.
They come to mind the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Soft Roof Adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitivated Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, retaken after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic crumb in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take over the character on his return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, who earned him in 1987 his only nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
Again he.
Times are jostling through his journey.
Young people know him mostly through the cult Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the Irish Mafia's Momentian Moon in Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several film legends that sooned the trade, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, his golds, pomp, and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "as a lively challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too much.
The profession was not always tender for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles fell long all cooked in the beak.
However, he played the young first less than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modest sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, painted a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdosed him dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that was sowing yesterday on Newman, his great boyfriend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating features of the extinct actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he also faded a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestor of Hollywood drifts.
His binette will have been seen a great deal on bribes, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, though gag at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from these sales were paid to its Foundation for Children in Difficult Circumstances.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters with a letter containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in short and in addition.
What could zuschlag zamp; Company in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin, against J. Oschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has resulted in particularly significant damage. Other charges have been brought against them, such as falsehood and use of forgery.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false bills.
The money of the State and municipalities, approximately HUF 65 million in total, went to the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and, on the other hand, to the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices for costs, behind which no actual benefit was provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large proportion of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books at the market in J. S.ros., while they were making the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours touring the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by Istvon Lados, at the request of Juns zushlag.
According to the statement of the latter, he had to identify boarding houses and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they issued the other invoices which they would enter, inter alia, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital for access to subsidies.
The majority of invoices were created by Istvon Lados and his accomplice, Androes Ri, who, according to our information, was mainly involved in drafting the files needed to obtain the subsidies.
During a "scoring circuit", one of the choices of Lados was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyes-let.
However, according to the manager's statement, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place, at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jovert Foundation, which will subsequently be read the name of Egyott at Harmadik Évezredért, was teeming with procedural and substantive faults.
A boarding house, located in Badacsonytomaj, had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned 10030 customers.
Expanded invoice issuers with a imaginary imagination also fell into excess when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also part of the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb J-v-ért nor that of the Hoppo appeared, according to the information given to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The company's manager, Gyuz Farkas, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the fact that, according to the bill, 100 people stayed there, did not stick together either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much room.
Moreover, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices have also not inquired about the travel agents in Budapest, which are part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. As a naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also runs counter to the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services concerning the travel activities, which are intended outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of the Hotel Révful-l-p to the order of Jobb Jv-ért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while fakes were handwritten.
The investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects in shapes, such as types of inadequate invoices and false stamps, that invoices issued to the order of Egytt a Harmadik Évezredért Alap-tv-ny, of XXI. Szzadi Kultur-lis Egyes-let and Biztos Pont proved to be false.
As in the case of the Ravenna Bt. company or the sports course in Kunfehért, both of whom deny that they are the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The forgers also paid no attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyuregyhaza, was in liquidation at the time when (in 2001) the Fiatal Virosert Egyes-let group was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the company's liquidator denies having issued this invoice.
Invoices made deliberately
Another category of invoice issuers is the one that was fully aware of their request to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esely Budapestért Alap-tv-ny Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal-Solo-Szocial-Szocialist-k Foundation, has drawn up an invoice to the order of the Egyottt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Gyurfi.
Similarly, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation, has cooperated with the companies, and in 2003 has issued invoices to the order of the Jobb Jov-ért Alap-v-ny Foundation, of the association Atlasz Egyes-let and the association V-r-sfeny-Egyes-let, for an amount of approximately 5 million HUF, but no MUF.
No financial movement has taken place either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but it was avoided by the agencies to mention it in their accounts.
The next category of invoice companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Managing Director of Delta Tria Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, headquartered in Budapest but where he could not be found there, was Ivon Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. de Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivon Kubatov also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged that he issued invoices to the company Atlasz, Hoppa and Egyott a Harmadik Évezredért Alap-vunny, and that it pocketed their value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivon Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies functioned, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He did, however, use these companies, since at the request of Maître Szente, co-accused and editor of the corporate foundation acts, he issued invoices to their names, to the order of associations relating to the company, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generci.
Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Tri, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to companies, valued at HUF 142 million.
The Public Prosecutor's Office believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as VAT went into the Kubatov pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to make fictitious invoices that were used in Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Genercia and Sz-vetség a Modern Magyarorsz-gerrt applied for a grant from the socialist public utility body, Tuncily Alap-tvunny (TMA).
They obtained this grant for twice HUF 500 000, but these amounts were not used for the targets indicated in the application.
To avoid this being known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search of the office of the Ministry of Education in the Office of the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report the method of manufacturing invoices, as they had previously done in the case of the prosecution.
What might be really interesting would be for the main accused, Junos zuschlag himself, to decide to lift the veil throughout the story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the last few details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in its own interest, or else, the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the 50 million HUF, it would bear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, since the applications for his house arrest, on the basis of a reduction in his conditions of detention, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf man.
While those who have caused much greater harm, and perpetrators of unrepairable economic crimes, are walking freely or at least wait at home to the end of the proceedings. He does not have that possibility.
The psychology of competition: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the commodity.
Neurological and economics researchers at New York University have successfully uncovered the neurological and economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be outpaced in this type of competition, such as an eBay auction, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw up a neurological schema of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analysed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the outcast of a third, the whole being under the brainstem, called striatum, moved intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, alongside several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers have pursued financial surveillance analyses.
In these, three groups outbid in front of a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group to check the real value of the product in question, and they thus made it possible to put them.
With another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would come out winning the game, then they would receive an additional 15 dollars, as a reward.
While the third group received these 15 dollars before the auction, but the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the focus was on one on victory, while in the other, on failure.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the players' team members "against failure" were willing to be more likely than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
'These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed at auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the risk parade.
Only neurological imaging methods helped remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation." - noted Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should we see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that 100 miles are infected with the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles are being treated. This is because patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and body fluids (permum, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach upset and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes on a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people worldwide die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to reach the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneaks awayly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing.
The infection is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed them.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic type C hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, so the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, to the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress to the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries bear a sum of EUR 11.2 billion, with this financial and insurance institution also having an interest in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this matter, by also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis in more than a year is for Fortis. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with Sunday night's decision, the three states will buy back almost half (49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, including, first, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organisation ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis shares began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of a crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
Analysts agree that, with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, reaching its lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, equities have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's directors, is not realistic.
The company's management is exposing the uncertainty across the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US USD 700 billion bailout, of being responsible for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as the new general manager.
The financial institution was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
Earlier, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches and has also acquired leasing companies.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment by analyzing at what level belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment proceeds as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing the electroshocks is fixed to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look backically at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, concerned its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scan, and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four parts, while watching either religious-themed painting or the more general theme painting.
Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", as someone who was "to be cared for" and they "scarved, and peace invaded them".
At the sight of religious-themed painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, among atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
'We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father,' said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, praised the results of this research.
'The practice of faith should change and in many cases actually changes our personality,' added Wright.
After these excellent results, all that remains is the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the sight of a better-quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you're divulging about you
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the back of people's pocket in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
However, this is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to sceptics drawing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see the bulk of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their original goal, which sounded as follows: "These let's work in a system all the information of the world."
According to the Google executive, after ten years of global upheaval, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be in five years' time? Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like, "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What would the work that would suit me best?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, the day when it knows enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during searches on the Internet, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by the people concerned are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search programme launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have looked for, on which they clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, a programme based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalised answers, and will submit products and services to us on the basis of our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google's monopoly on information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remord, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against power that can provoke a violation of truth among Internet users.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Probably the most resounding example of recent times is the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had gathered on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human-minded netizens were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, with Google, arm over it with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court against the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be forced by any of the constitutions to disclose information about the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 research terms it had won in relation to strengthening the Child Protection Act, passed several years ago. But in the end, it is not able to obtain the lists of searches of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
So Google's judgment is quite contradictory: it's sluggish by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. As a result, they are attacking them in the spirit of revolt that is being manifested against multinational corporations that are proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its "wild" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the "cumulative corporate", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, categorized as the world invader because of Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the program package, which is continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what Web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 is no more than collaboration, that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels made available to us, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essentials remain the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, it can connect them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also run blogs, in which their most recent photo galleries appear automatically, which they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While you can see many examples, such as the girlfriend who easily understands morning photos, taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the one of the company that fired a number of his employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be sure of a thing: the term privacy is totally reconsider.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how one can define the principle behind the behaviour of today's young people.
Anyone wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google’s monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not the least. Google Online services, through word processing, to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server parks and do not assemble our best profile, having existed to date.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of 156 billion dollars, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an ever-increasing speed cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but to many other creators of computer programs.
However, critic observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it doubled the price of the business kindergarten and after the company considered the daily multiple restoration too expensive, taken at any time. All of this seems drisory in the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced to the Chinese government, and according to the terms of their agreement, the company is detecting all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are only announced when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some people think that Google's paper and book archiving project is taking on such important dimensions that the company is about to end up facing the Supreme Court in the United States, others are shaking in front of its Health system, because in this one, you can build a complete medical profit from our previous test results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is mounting a genetic database can give the next generation of science fiction writers a good commodity. The famous Cory Doctorow novel, written with Orwellian half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way through Google data.
Two minors helped to remove the traces of the double homicide of Ozd
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ozd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the Borsod Department.
Young people have acknowledged the charges against them. For the time being, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency), are girls, defend themselves free.
Complicity in complicity in murder may result in detention of up to five years.
The suspect in the double homicide of 23-year-old local man zd was remanded in custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, and it was for this reason that he attracted his creditor last Wednesday to a site in Ozd where he killed him, as well as the 9-year-old man's little girl.
According to MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes proposal for the takeover of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed EUR 200 million, around 5 billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the shares package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that, previously, the Czechs had excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to separate more than 60% of its actions in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the newest owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the documents would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank, with about 25% of the stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Cesko Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, worsening day by day, the leading European press newspapers are already talking about a 'second 11 September'.
"The global financial disaster is due to the US President" - accuses the daily newspaper in Rome, La Repubblica. "The president was not even able to stand together with his own party behind a bill, improvised by speed, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily newspaper El Mundo, it was the failings of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is growing every day, and the whole world will pay a high price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, but according to the Congressional vote, a real danger, the one that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The global economy is hanging in a vacuum, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - points out the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still stretch a lifeline for their staggering financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers’ money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the European Union states to disregard their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily newspaper, Der Standard, which adds that fears that European taxpayers, too, will have to get their hands out of the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is going through the old continent from one side to the side.
'rescuers' must not immediately hold EUR 100 billion, but it would be wise if they would note in which case it would be rational to receive taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
Smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What better method would be to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, except for the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave the initial strategic idea to Nissan's engineers, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a robotic mini-car, a BR23C, self-powered, bio-inspired, system, which it equipped with bee qualities, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system that could avoid all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee is its own oval-shaped space, which in reality looks very much like our safe protective shell - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the brand's research and development and technological public relations department.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
The latter identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by a sufficient angle to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre is proceeding entirely instinctively.
'If this were not the case, the mini auto robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where, for the moment, the collision is considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Opposite bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, the acceleration as well as the slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a larger energy concentrate, making their lifetime longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and to react with the intuitive logic based on the data from previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need a memory of a gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instantaneous avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter mass-produced cars within the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles in its path.
We even gave the baby an overpriced name
The written version of the 700-billion-dollar economic rescue package, aimed at buying back the banks' dubious loans, and using it in instalments, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount is going to be spent.
Reuters announces that in new debates continuing until midnight on Saturday, local time on the East Coast, congressional leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days around the bailout plan, which is worth a total of 700 billion dollars.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, who has only to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born on the basis of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said, commenting on the outcome of the trade-off, that the program will work and be effective, but further action needs to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but of turning the workings of the economy around the other way.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local time Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to pass the bill on the case of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then his fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then, the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are satisfied with the advances made that night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy" - said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
On the other hand, the program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which stated that the USD 700 billion had to be spent in one go on to buy back-searches for bad loans.
From now on, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the passage of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase bad debts from banks, while the use of the additional USD 100 billion will be left to the President’s discretion.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The second half of the 700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it may purchase bad debts, securities relating to bad mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The competent persons of the Ministry have stated that the takeovers may take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that give rise to the concerns, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to spend 700 billion dollars on the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the vast redemption of bad debts, their insurance, or the risk of the system causing the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the law, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank managers in poor position and waiting for state aid can expect that their severance payments, simply called golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government.
Wage cap is only mentioned in specific cases. In addition, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat redsaws as part of an auction, they will levy a tax surplus on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the release of the bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
For the image to be complete, it must nevertheless be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The capping applies only to new contracts, thus giving reasons for participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in force regarding the general directors' salaries - commented Democrat Barney Frank, the chairman of the committee responsible for financial services in the House of Representatives.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks involved in the plan. In this way, taxpayers’ risk diminishes, as they can even win in the business as soon as the economy and with it the banks rescued fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that, over the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why the U.S. citizens have mandated us, this doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars -- said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent over the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - the Hungarian Central Statistics Office reported.
Industrial export sales prices rose by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they fell by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to those of the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices rose only to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sector have increased only slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with the manufacture of bags and belts, with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, followed by shoe production with a monthly increase of 2.5 per cent.
The higher price of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a considerable monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector for products and chemicals (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), machinery and electrical appliance manufacturing (0.9 per cent) sectors, as well as a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry increased from 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which are a significant impact on national industrial operations, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sale of the processing sectors, the oil processing sector prices rose most significantly (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices rose by 13.2 per cent, while prices in the important food, beverage and tobacco production rate rose by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have taken place in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases have increased from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded those of the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
Among the domestic trade groups and sector allocation in August, it was the initiators of profit-to-investment that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while prices in the energy and materials for subsequent processing sectors did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and materials production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors of production of consumer goods, inflation was measured by 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-making sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent was measured.
Export sales prices in the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared with the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment has weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared in August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to travel to the United States?
Kinga Guncz believes that there is a good chance that around 12 January, the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force. This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago to the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "now everything depends only on when electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic are put into operation".
Every time, she has drawn attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the Commander's Cross Decoration with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain support the bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama, like John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, secured their support for the government’s bailout package of 700 billion dollars. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congressional representatives and the Administration finally announced on Sunday at dawn that they reached agreements in principle on the bank bailout.
This financing plan, aimed at the thawing of the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, as well as fitment than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a little bit in advance. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a mockery just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would pass the 700-billion-dollar bailout law quickly.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages that he, too, supported.
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas out of date.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, "We will all find it difficult to swallow it... but doing nothing is not a possible way".
The Republican Senator said that in the proposal, mention is the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the cap on senior executives's severance pay, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will pass the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - as Der Spiegel, the low CSU score in the Bavarian country, refers to.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German-left news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers".
According to this well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades, and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
At the same time, this change of the period is the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday came a process that was likely to happen, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU picked up at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the era of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "difficking of one's parents", which was consistently implemented in the region by the CSU.
It's been 40 years since sociologists announced this, but they were very wrong about the pace. However, secularization, educational outcomes and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing Bavarian region could not have an impact on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with the increase in opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and stubborn.
It is also astonishing that in recent weeks it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as self-employed, craftsmen, baccalaureate holders and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, UHC support fell below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? Party presidents are standing on the reserve in front of coalition issues", the Austrian conservative daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that took hold after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPO wanted to talk to the conservatives of the SPA.
The SPA prohibits the SSP from meddling in its internal affairs.
The Populist Party is being opened for negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders barely glimplished their cards.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP-Scho, confirmed that he wanted to talk to the SVP.
The SPA wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schassel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the SVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a very open question. These points absolutely must be discussed in the VP.
Mr Haider, the President of the B, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and blacks, we are ready to take on government responsibilities" - said Haider.
Jurika said: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, has begun in Paris as the representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, the Fidesz European People's Party MEP, L.J., Mr. L.J., drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and, as a result, one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most eminent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of Mr Fidesz Parti Populaire, he warned that, in addition to the distinctions found during recruitment, Roma people disappeared from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of Roma youth do not have secondary diplomas, and as a result of poor basic education, only a tiny part has the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma."
At the same time, he stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in asserting other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the broadest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma child began school, the more likely heeded to become a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participated in the State budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, the Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education."
According to the honourable Member, a cooperation of the European Union oriented towards an objective and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. To this end, compliance with the existing and in-prepared anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken. Roma children must be given the opportunities of democracy, so that they can participate as citizens of full power in the future of Europe" - demanded Jurika.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities" for all, the objective of the annual Equal Opportunities Summit in Europe since the Summit in Berlin last year is to provide a unique platform to support equal opportunities and anti-discrimination measures, targeted at European and Member State level.
A fox in the chicken house
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with an applicant, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of the information concerning the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the agreement of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting his chicken house to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital dependent in the event of damage on the state of health of the customer, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they had seen the results.
Over the past decade, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies, data on the person's drug purchases within the 18 months. From this, the program determines itself, which disease suffers the person and what his or her state of health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, it refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this programme are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer apart from the paperwork. However, tiny problems may still occur.
Among the disadvantages of this programme is the fact that a medicine can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flushes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in data research and analysis. They must ask the patient for the authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory analysis results, and link them to drug consumption data. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the patients' state of health.
More and more companies have access to data, and monitoring of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on the expansion of the supervisory circle of authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and therefore further developed his programme, which would condition the data transmission of the data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
This is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
So, and ultimately, chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
CSU: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the ouched duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian UHC summits has been postponed.
The party's chairman, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Gunther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is, how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of this highly criticized pair made it felt that they were not particularly in their seats.
As a result, they sought to appease the furious members of the fraction and base, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, CSU was the only "sovereign" in Bavaria, giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But conservatives still rely heavily on this southern region, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates grueling discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the values of the right, about a possible coalition of the government.
A strange nose of fate was that, with the help of the list of Free Electors, the Gabriele Pauli, whose measurement against Stroiber was used as a coup opportunity perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, and then treat the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now, the CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing, somehow, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former chairman of the CSU, named 28 September as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU. According to him, they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, will only be able to be Chancellor again if they are re-established in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, with difficulty hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of UHC’s ground will not negatively influence Berlin’s grand coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the social-democratic crisis is still going on.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst performance with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MP acceded to the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegality committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislative in this country of 10 million people has been going very well against for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, following in the footsteps of the modification of the constitution in 2006, "let" this time "let's" vote.
In this way, the ODS has abandoned its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the ever-increasing Russian natural gas imports, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas conduits crossing the country, passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive change rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of standing for one third of the candidates for the opposition, referred to a pre-abyization.
However, Monday's OSCE communiqué already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a paper confederation, considers the two independent territories for a month already.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU" - Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "power has been afraid in this parliament, which has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition does not foresee any protest actions in the light of the results. Instead, she is trying to send her message about the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on this side: we have to have our oppressive newspapers in Russia print, the local authorities put sticks in our wheels as far as broadcasting is concerned, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers security as the main result.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'eminting the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time" - Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are twice as a factor of increased trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this issue also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other, largely global problems.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great and emerging democratic power that should be given a broader right to speak in international affairs, but the member countries have yet to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Moreover, they did not give too much attention to this issue yesterday at the 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, like the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods fell from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an over-ambitious target.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights. In this way, air trade will also be able to take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's largest trading partner, and on the other, New Delhi, which is only ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan had been strongly condemned, as had all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on the subject had been discussed.
The completion of the Doha trade round was also called upon, although both share the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its toxic discharges by at least 20% until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need to cross-border market at next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The head of State of India is now visiting the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency's information, the agreement would be for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 various countries who will occupy the fair's 171,790 square metres with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibitions, and Turkey as guests of honour.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Property and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: Italy will be present institutionally, with a Point Italy- 264 square metres of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press in Room Struktur, butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and foresight on the position of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author's books is gradually decreasing in relation to total Italian production, and in particular in relation to that for adults and children.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of the Chigi Palace had revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in force against the clever little ones, against who points out and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The novelty anti-laugrants was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Revolving doors - Brunetta - is an instrument for better working with more productivity, presence and more services," said the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"This is reformism", Brunetta also points out.
The installation in all establishments of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees has been recorded, says the secretary-general: 'this is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the cooperation of all.'
In short, more breakfasts during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Promise of Brunetta, who suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister announced that "in three months, the absences of sickness of public employees has been reduced by 50%, i.e. 60 more working families in one year'.
And he added that it was essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the Minister - over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees united to challenge the Brunetta decree standards using Codacons.
"while the Minister for the Civil Service is now testing the data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'active lazy' continue to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the Public Administration who were correct and productive, had come together to declare war to the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service is questioned; the extension of the hours of the hours of the sick worker's accommodation schedule, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions necessary for the Minister.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to draw the attention of institutions, social forces and information resources to this dramatic aspect, the Anmil today celebrates the 58th National Day for Accident Victims on Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace", said President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association for the Mutilated and Invalids of Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "soler appreciation for the continued action to promote prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the raising of public awareness"
"naturally indignantly indignant, everyone has shattered to put an end to such tragedies which, because of their size, arouse the clamour of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that 'there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information'
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to be on the alarm on social gravity, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed to the fact that "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data of the accidents on work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive", said President of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later.
"we do not want this 'high-falling trend' to be translated into a minor attention, because it is precisely when attention comes, that the tragedy comes.
"we believe that in general, we are not doing enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"We thought - stressed Mercandelli - more checks and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, from school onwards."
- He added - "the need for a further effort in communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced the 'gradation of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work' and the 'drift of assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years'.
"The aim, therefore, is to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - so that the fate of the person who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneousness or the enlargement of the legislator"
Pointed finger Mp3 reader, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers, can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a statement issued in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks of the EU, published today.
'from this scientific report - let's read in the note - it shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least five years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices for more than one hour a day and week are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity.'
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
'According to the scientific data, says the manager Ue - this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow up on new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, in view of the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
'Scientists-concluded executive Ue- confirm that there are good reasons to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties , what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could derive from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as the reduction of noise exposure levels and duration.
The Scientific Committee (SEA) points out that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force relating to the maximum noise level agreed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods of time are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to make the Commission leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the 'Commission for the future of Rome Capital', which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the Commission's other 49 components will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they have completed, the Committee and the Communal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the Official stamp of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The committee is absolutely independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented - would like to highlight Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No overlay of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
By March, she will finish her tasks and then disappear, because this experiment must have a precise time duration.
In June-to-announce the Mayor-we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those accusing the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see forward, and further, towards deeper foresight, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Furthermore, the Mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost Roman dwellers a euro, and will not cost Roman dwellers a euro, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a strategic, firm or immobile blueprint to enable our city to improve, which is absolutely necessary, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit,".
A future which, the Mayor of Rome, 'will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further' not only from the point of view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and should have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relationships (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama are rising as the election date draws closer.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really cheeky: he believes he will gain the highest position of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators."
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; these are, of course, attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, all of which state that Obama will win and have a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the polling booth, we know who the American patriot will vote on.
Now, an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end is.
"Tell what you want, we'll see to put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 per cent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked back to the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Whoever will take George W's place will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is even felt by journalists: in the press, it is time to abolish them. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of newsprint.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information officers, they felt less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where editors work on assembling newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if it is desired that traditional journalism as the general public hears it, will not be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65 per cent.
Printed publication for broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "assassin" of newsprint.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest hang up in American journalism lies between who direct the newsrooms -- that is, the directors--and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage drops to 23 per cent.
For some, this is linked to the "safety of work".
Directors who think they are losing their jobs in the 3-year space are 47% nationally.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are going to 30 per cent.
"Safe work" at the staff level (our editors) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer whatever they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Managers almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to a total of 15 days, spent a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REST A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the body of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his town, Grottaferrata, for a house in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl Escaling Instruction.
At his prosecution last week, he obtained the home release converted into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be able to travel from the provincial city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the pm did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the House of Representatives vote, contrary to the White House-approved 700-billion-dollar bailout: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in salvaging the US economy.
And it was yesterday's New York Times that confirms to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its moderate East Coast soul, which is favourable to federal institutions as well as to business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, as a conservative, hostile to "the two in Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, precisely, which was made to be felt in a despotic manner with the vote that I was talking about at the beginning.
But what has just been cited is just one example of the changes, of the big changes that the current economic earthquake is pre-announced or already letting run: not just in the United States, but in the West, and perhaps not just here.
In the United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to have accelerated phenomena incubated for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the extraordinary revival, of the dual country-sovereign category, compared with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with foreigners, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in a single country, in a single State.
This immediately creates a political problem for which it governs it: that is to say, to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only a national one.
Political internationalisation seems to be truly out of the game or, or not much to say: the clear proof is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide on any common political line.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects from interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a credit affection: when we go through a difficult period, it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimization to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no international market or organization can ever have a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-crisis is, moreover, in full harmony with the ever-major importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor rather linked to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, indeed, when we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once, that our future will, on the contrary, have to settle its accounts more and more with things that are not very material, such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly possesses more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the bad luck to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other side, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of grey areas.
And, moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discrediting, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries of the West.
Thus, the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be always more alien to the opinions of majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, nourishes underground, a powerful and branched movement of the delegitimas of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral revolts or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter most recently, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of Labour in Great Britain,chance).
One gets the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, are ever more difficult, which is not today, to understand and therefore represent the deep strata of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is increasing, increasing and potentially agitating in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, talking about a current 'rebellion of the masses' on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But we say well, keeping our eyes wide open, that is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
That is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measured barely 2.5 square centimeters, researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti." Explicits at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs, which provide the animal with a perfect adherent.
Testing on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it 'get off the wall easily,' explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton University's engineering faculty.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? – "This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps it is, but researchers are thinking of much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that carbon nanotubes are heat and electric current conductive.
Other applications could be aerospace engineering.
Right now, no superhero.
RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive of microfibers such as hair, which self-cleans dust during movement over an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Look out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are bleathing and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter the absorption or decreasing, depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices whether they are, in a box or fresh, if combined with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he sounds a new alarm: it only takes a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apples to reduce their health.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticised because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistamin and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
RISK-- It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year-old newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to be under-assessed the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what is being used, if medicines are taken such as Diazepam or Méthadone.
DO NOT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Milan: 'These discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies which will have to change the informative notes of the medicines if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative documents of the medicines that are taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist", the expert told the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the greatest criticisms of the Bush administration’s foreign-economic and foreign-policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during Enron's days of bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on The New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that unleashed many polemics, and that was blamed on the economist for years, but now proved to be true.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive divulgator with a style, which is particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year-long work, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows up to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and becoming less austere, to other more important ones, such as compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) format.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some module-specific functions, such as the one that reduces the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, which is useful for sending them by e-mail, or for importing PDF files into the graphics development module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text developer.
Multi-person collaboration is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoid conflicts over modifications, in the development of texts, because to each collaborator is assigned a commentary color for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of OpenOffice functions on the cloud, and in the coming weeks they are expected to deliver the final result.
The Italian version can be unloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the sequel is, as usual, also available, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be shipped to home or at the workplace.
And if the subject of free education can be a means of disseminating it in the houses, it is precisely in business that Open Office the continuation tries the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business foresight.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's equivalent video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the planned figure.
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it was the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily newspaper L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third-generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on the Kohl test pieces are some of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirm the Cera positivity, the Austrian will lose his third place on the Tour and will necessarily have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus winning the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES REQUESTS IF ITALY IS RACTIC?
Italy "as countries of emigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" reluctantly welcomed.
Would that turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times, which dedicated a long article debating the subject of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a cookie.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the 'Northern paradox': the northern regions are both those where there is "more integration and more work", but also "a strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new Lega legislature to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to overcome racism."
Fossett's plane, the missing billionaire a year ago, was reunited with Steve Fossett's plane.
The wreck of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire missing on 3 September 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 metres in the area of the Sierra Nevada of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, no human remains, however.
Madera County sheriff John Anderson tempered the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore clarified that no human remains were found either on or around the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The United States Bureau of Transport Security (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the site, identified the aircraft: it was Bellanca 8kcab, who disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in the story thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the round-the-world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and no stopover.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters in height, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you're not expecting.
An extraordinary 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, with large surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest addition to the "compact" off road of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this area.
Just because of its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17.
Thus, the hype that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented communication modality, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a brand car.
A maxi-display project, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, it will be the impression that by looking at the image, the car leaves the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is clear that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed in arousing the interest of the future buyers? We'll see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are the 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created major problems.
Nor had ever clashed with the opposing tifosi.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (fairly not) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had three-color flags on which their home town appeared: Saturday night, they were all kidnapped for not being identified.
They are inspired by English titoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a titatry of real Nazismiths, that of the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the part: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosis who had a history of a stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will happen from the Bulgarian police, and then take action: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorder are purging a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that bans people from attending Italian but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Luckily.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others are in danger of being added to the first 150.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the Viminal argues.
So, "keep your eyes wide open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is a small core of Ultras Italian fans.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday, the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say, the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
This is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, to praise Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
'I am not a sociologist - adds the Observatory's No. 1 - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact is done.
Until now, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles about Mameli's anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite..."
Students who were victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market is not in crisis
According to the Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding whole categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families from whom they have to support - explains the head of the Sunia consultancy, Laura Mariani, in these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, unregistered contracts, no rental limits, sub-rentals.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of tax taxation are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about EUR 450; for a single room, we range from a minimum of EUR 650 (Nerre Ban zone), to an average value of 800 (Lambiata, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of EUR 900 (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 euros for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (EUR 550 for one single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiens and Cinecittà).
We can only save if you move away in the peripheral areas: EUR 300 for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single one, we spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for a bed, it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old Paradiso cinema, cities eliminate historical halls.
Historical cinemas close in favour of the Multiplex.
"A city without movie theater is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major urban centres of Italy, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of the marginalization of cinemas, with the birth of large multi-rooms on the periphery, and the death of the mono rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that we consider to be inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical and memory-laden places, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of the path and so many emotions," observes the director of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix de la Jure de Cannes, and whoLost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of shopkeepers, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have paid mainly the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is in the lead with 82 single-the-nat cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrationally", observes Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the state's anterior debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
Support for the sector would require between EUR 16 and 18 million per year.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, concerned by these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single-room cinemas in historic centres and on the outskirts.
Among the planned standards are tax-care measures for managers and public benefits in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special parking rates and in some car parks.
"I like this initiative," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
It is clear, however, that, in order to contrast the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradiso Cinema" that I had been thinking for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and the arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the town's choices with the interests of the Piromalli clan."
heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, the mayor and vice-mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external competition for Mafia association.
The levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little son, the boss's namesake, already convicted of a maficious criminal association, and to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral standards, and especially common sense" write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus the clan would have been granted - write the judges - to enter officially into the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orienting the public administration"
The chairman of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide only 'collusions between local committees and organised crime, there is more than one' in his region: 'there are places where Mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the indrangheta, heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests follow last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of the alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a right-centre coalition after the May 2006 bundle.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, accusing him of having engineered the whole thing on a political issue, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in asking for the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm wrote, emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformly the choices of public administration with the clan's interests.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones start.
This is a disproportionate deposit that occupies more than 70% of the world's surface area and now the world's large energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which coloss like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now are trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for 100 years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil are giving the sector a great deal of growth.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15% of the global electricity requirement could be covered by sea swell operating systems.
This would be double the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides.
Coloss on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 simulated an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the understanding was announced, it would have been a real revolutionary step.
Two years from that age, more and more candidates from these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy are betting on marine energy.
'Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies - said the spokesman for a company associated with the US oil shoes, in the business daily Wall Street Journal - and she assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us.'
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the United States Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that in Alaska, the Usa continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a plan for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the way of energy from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are not known, according to observers, a growing interest.
Tecnology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, because marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a major ecosystem problem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a higher environmental impact must be used.
"And choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a buoy system connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the sludge to move upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
Pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
For the time being, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and parking space using six submarine turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorisations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves the potential of tides at the moment.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, are looking to the coast, invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and plans to invest up to 35 million dollars in 2009.
