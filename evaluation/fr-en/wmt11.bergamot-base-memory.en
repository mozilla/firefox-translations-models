What's going to happen? CSSD does not know of a Voldemort or a pastry shop in Prague.
The new elected representatives of CSSD at the town hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the level of the city council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, namely if they know the scork that was born in the last years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were heading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the Prague political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well the terms known.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young start in Prague politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to the culture in the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather".
And when it comes to the veteran politics, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"This is the only expression you propose to me that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the scam.
Vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the ODS, the editorial staff chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry", "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "enter".
Three of the elected officials agreed for the quiz, the fourth-st. Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
Fifth elected Petr Dolinek rejected the test altogether.
"I don't take care of these things at all and how are the representatives of citizen democracy having fun: I will not give my opinion."
“I’m currently dealing with how we’re going to understand each other in our programs,” he said.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing in Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," said Kaucky, adding immediately: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language class," he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected official for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to bake".
"It's, I think, about going into a company," Plachy is willing to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same tone Brezina reminds us that he draws his knowledge rather from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexicon of stoll in social democracy.
“I’ve come to the advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don’t have something like that.”
“We’re talking about names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols,” said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which Party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," said Karel Brezina of nicknames.
The daily newspaper Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Grandpa for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to employ within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of baton law" it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor of law JUDr. at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, not working for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man very rarely has this fate."
“Young women are not considered healthy because they participate in the work and give birth to children,” says a sister who cares in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” the Die Standard newspaper warned of the downside of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbour of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they sprayed on her.
The BBC's server transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version the oil that serves ritual unctions has ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil flamed, it seems, when the team wanted to "cast out the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Human-minded eaters have always been a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia has even seen the President participate in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have tried by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea who came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen randomly in villages in The Gambia," the organization said in a message.
On the farm, imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The stoves are heating up, he has signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out through the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," the man who has the power of signature is pointed out on his son's new contract.
"But I signed anyway," he explains, speaking in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when will be published a notice to explain the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of the hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesdays at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is on on the touch screen.
Only one pressure and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number already starts to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a split second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44000 apartments in the RPG portfolio receive mail with the new lease agreements in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"it has been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," replies, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client introduces herself as a journalist.
The deragulation and old apartments of Bakal miners are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats mentioned this in a rather sustained way before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a put... in a board in the toilets, relieves himself in the introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they now sign as promised RPG in a special offer.
It is a discount of half the amount of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG poses both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
“These are not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way of acting legally,” RPG said on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the customer center is right.
"I have 13000 retirement crowns and I have 5000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait, "says she.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, in addition, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
“The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 percent and covers no less than 31200 apartments, or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.”
"And it will always be at most 7,50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen said.
The 38 percent increase is only for 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech crowns per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices have included architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch company. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, children of Arch. design employees have been going there.
The Archlectonic Projects Society Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini corporate kindergarten since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, especially the age to have children, and it was important to her that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design. themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing allocations (up to 2.8 mil. of Czech crowns). They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years insure qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the financing endowment (two years) the Arch company. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was Economy rating that helped to make the staffing request.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, all day long a nurse and kindergarten teacher take care of the children; children can go to kindergarten without age limit but they are over three years old for the most part.
As this is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is individual care and education, the program of the mini kindergarten is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not only play but a quality education is also guaranteed - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and not have the stress of a delay to pick up the children from a school far from the parents’ workplace.
Parents use their working hours in the most productive way.
No wonder a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer is created.
Arch.Design. has thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look in the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic shapes, the house received from the locals the nickname of Maison en bone.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere of curves, this is all that is popular for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of gloss of colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measurement.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, eyelet and slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was carried out for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations were born for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals dubbed the house hot just after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, given the specific window opening mechanism called it "the bailout house".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi has designed for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi did not respect the construction guidelines of the time and did not allow itself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans was so vague that two years later during the finishing of the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
It was not, for example, for members of the city council that the pillars of the construction encroached on the public sidewalk.
There was never any modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a shared living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which access is reached to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate maintenance.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two floors in addition.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with skylights.
The two-colored game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark that on the contrary absorbs the sun’s rays.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits because they found that this is a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to common areas and attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent off.
The sum is still above the entrance fee to Gaudi's other constructions in the city.
If you want to feel the actual atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and completely visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a box spring: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bedtime, so the mattress and the box spring give a real base for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive,: weight, height, age, health status as well as gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the bed base will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where the latex mattresses are not continuously sleeped are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
In addition, they have a weight greater than the standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also be formed.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends time abroad frequently using very thick mattresses with a softening layer, will feel difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the Hokeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
“Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore poorly assumes “information” from the joints and skin,” says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything is working well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be a guy from NHL to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
For the choice of mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, i.e. about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or a total of 180 cm.
For single-seat beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple ruler for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Executioners-Materchies and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own bed base and mattress, so be careful however during the buy to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the box spring at different heights and this is not feasible on all the bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"To the touch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of box spring.
The bed-summer, when the mattress and the box spring are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very bad; it should not be washed, which is common today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this, specialists refuse to advertise over a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime guarantee.
But everything to his but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the covering of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper for all the whole, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for the washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the large models (and for a single person) becomes when we remove them a fight between a light weight and a heavy truck in a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a box spring?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of aeration.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slatted box springs with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are lined in the bottom part of the kidneys and that it is thus possible to regulate it.
For mattresses in several positions it is not necessary to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes of position.
Next to the adjustment of the rigidity of the slats it is also possible to install what is also called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special bond of the slats that makes it possible to press or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", it's really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who for the "males" have started to use a softening area at the shoulders.
But they also think of women – they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or plate box springs with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and reduces the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and box spring, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the box spring or the area swept into the mattress) the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also to the organic mattress.
The raw materials based on petroleum, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” says Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of birch plants so that the covering of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" women.
The red pepper extract accelerates the blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the top spot.
Saving for the mattress and bed base is not easy.
One can from time to time have in the context of special actions by manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
As for example the company Magniflex which offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
We can of course take the second for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a large thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
It started as a matter for NASA because astronauts were under enormous load factors at the start.
The Tempur softens to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is for this purpose ideal against the evil slept and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special cushions for feet that relieve legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver or of the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child is leading more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about espionage but only about another way to reduce the likelihood that there will be another tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to carry on him a thing of this type, he will get rid of it.
“And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long-standing expectations,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it's a prepared abduction, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking equipment develops, they (the criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
“In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police,” the psychologist said.
She admits that such devices can help during an assault not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, says having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device may be parameterized in such a way that it is in regular emission after a determined period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in a lying position without moving,” Cech said.
According to him the so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special software.
The problem with current tracing systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a pendant the size of a matchbox or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that is why tests are being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
“Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time,” he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to trace cars.
This is a combination of systems for acquiring a position using GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it. But it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from the limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave the reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cords from MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army's pyrotechnicians, whom MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance corresponds to 25 000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could go through it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough to a maximum of 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited because of the need for money.
About the lack of body linen we don't talk about it.
"And I don't take my head if they buy such a large amount of detonating cords from us."
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the military is a good customer that we strive as merchants to satisfy,” says STV Group commercial director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues that hundreds of km of detonating cords are pursured by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of lifespan of detonating cords and pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
“If they’re perfectly stored in the depots, it can go even up to four years,” said one who doesn’t want his name published with regard to criticism from the military.
The lifespan, each munition must be tested to see if it remains honest and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating strings.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s supply of 245 km,” said spokesman Pejsek, who is the interpreter of the defense ministry’s buyers’ opinion.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the pyrotechnicians of the police who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always only order the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for safety reasons of pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more softly more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence now has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading to the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap".
Until today I benefit from contacts that I have obtained thanks to the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec it was missing a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in three-year graduate studies, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between quality and the price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year there came another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise have come forward," said the number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license for the start of operation of a hotel on a large scale the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year served well, adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this contest to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge until today that he could not have gotten in any other way.
"With those I met through the competition I started to maintain business relationships regularly.
According to him, the reputation related to successes has also had an impact on employees.
And he has about 70.
"I observe at home above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has generally been recognized."
“This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was soon replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the meaning of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind you.
The one who came to get the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award has encouraged not only my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight the competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the Communists confiscated the property, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
It has become after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers start to get to know the Farmet brand really well but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that got the greatest success in its home country,” Zdarsky said.
But the past year has not only happened in Farmet in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and partly in 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
“Of course, we have not escaped this situation.”
“The turnover has fallen by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even fire,” Zdarsky said.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular action must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and retained benefit results even though they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
“We built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company’s presentation in international fairs and exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions,” Zdarsky says.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The turnovers go back and with them the number of employees also.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The investigation into the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The unglorious winner of this year's inquiry into the absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the business register while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the commercial register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To bring out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfil in the Czech Republic and to have those that are absurd removed is the meaning of this contribution of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and still has greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters have come forward, it is at least 4000 this year that have brought their voice.
And this is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only curb the company, and, this, more and more.
“We may be among the number of documents to be completed for tax returns in the top places in the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity is becoming a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of conditions for the company, or 8 more places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was set up for the first time in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September every year, the last deadline before the closing of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last investigation last year, it is a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and professors.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that vehicles maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins in early November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts clubs in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before to the office for the sole proprietorship at the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Sole Proprietorship Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report a service trip to the Labour Office for a foreign employee over 30 days, was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the debate for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their practice, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year of the competition of Hospodarske Noviny, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is support for the reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that monitor their company’s impact on the environment and engage in a socially responsible activity,” said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, the firm Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the 2010 firm of the year competition, organized by the firm Vodaphone, have registered companies that have no success with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this applies to people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is no example of the pro-software company Pragoise Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent and, for this purpose, has obtained the title of the firm Responsable pour la région de Bohême centrale and which placed third in the region in the competition of the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has earned for having introduced flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, a decrease in salary.
The jury also deferated her the title because she buys in priority to Czech manufacturers, supports a diday activity in the close environment and is concerned about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
The company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
“We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadows that helps the local Roma community,” says Ondrej Suchy, the company’s representative.
Also in the last place is a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
“In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and recreation,” says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravia-Silesia region.
Were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, all the regional finalists for the Vodaphone's Firm of the Year competition, who had replied to the questionnaires attached to the registration document and had returned it to the organizer before August 15.
The incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in the running had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsable but were not disqualified from the competition "main" the Firm of the year of Vodaphone".
"Independent entries are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," says Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Lands Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Lands Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos. G.
He had endeavoured to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a restitution application in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay to Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are chasing a person for insider trading in connection with a public tender and competition," said the head of the prosecutor's office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police handed over the 46-year-old entrepreneur to the liberty after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in view of the so little official information.
To a question from Pravo, the spokeswoman of the Fund of Lands Lubomira Cerna indicated that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace and, during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no way an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is put in place when several candidates who are beneficiaries of law appear.
"These people propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to residences that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of the acquirers is put in place and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and since he is also a person himself, having bought a large number of rights to restitution, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably took it by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
It was included in the case of the former leader of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for having edited land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been published.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place where the artery of access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardizing the construction by a blockade of the land.
Households will pay an extra of a hundred crowns monthly for housing.
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will have to pull from their wallets up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas is almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be around for households in apartments the 100 crowns annually more than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
We can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month, Libérec families will pay more than 1000 kronor annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation in the event that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the Pragues will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are rising by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase for example significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be brought to court by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for reoffending are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of physicians who encounter cases similar to the admissions of the children's departments of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk."
“The trend is really strong alcohols,” said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children’s department of Horovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to steal a bottle from Dad in the closet, it's sometimes Wisky but it's the fernet and the vodka that prevails.
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so do not smell it,” explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokesman for the Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today it is the alcohol in fashion especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was about slivovice that they brought home," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Department Pélikan, seeing drunken children aged thirteen to fourteen years for hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide areas completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized in this way four times
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described the particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Centre at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't appear weird to the mother that his daughter is away 48 hours," said the Department's director.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of parents or their extraordinary tolerance in the face of the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to the specialists, however, we do not speak of the dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the alcoholic term we hear a chronic addiction to alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that we do not find in children."
“In those who use recurrent alcohol, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family back-ground,” explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a serious intoxication requiring hospitalization are integrated into the statistics.
Children who are drunk who are after emergency care taken home by parents or police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal waves with which we can count: the day of the witches, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after poor results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"Of course I experienced on Witch Day an admission of 7 drunken children at once," Pélikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the day after the "whim of wood".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are for this reason better off since they spend a great evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re only amazed at where they are,” Pélikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of patients at least with the grade to pay for their care.
Transport by ambulance and intensive care bed hospitalization can range into tens of thousands of crowns.
“From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by counting to these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay off a single evening,” added Pelikan.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their declining managements, which should recover from parents the care-related burdens, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five in total, for which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is headquartered.
This is the first time that such aircraft have become the property of anyone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the context of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 which were until now in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three devices are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the aircraft from Vodochody is currently unknown.
“The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange have been taken on long-stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investment for the Ministry of Defence.”
“The two-seater L-159 T1s were traded in the state,” Pejsek said.
He added that the army would not remain without a two-seater since the ministry signed an agreement worth 200 million crowns in May 2009 for the department to convert four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seater aircraft.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"This is therefore the case of the one who takes into account determining how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The Directorate of Defence argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only uses 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in the context of a European-wide call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the ring finger are at lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
It may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men before the age of 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo the prostate cancer test, including combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right-hand index shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
For those with the longer index than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60 the decrease in risk reached 87 percent.
The ratio of length of the two mentioned fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child in the uterus is exposed.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him, it seems, that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Czech Republic like most of Europe is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the clearers have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the information
In the 91st kilometer a truck was crashed, at the 93rd two heavy trucks crashed, the accident left the injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit there
Drivers should go out just after Brno in the 190th kilometer or go by Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this is just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, lines of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are lagging behind, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place de la paix (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague Crisis Staff is yet to meet.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast links because of the snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems for example
Travellers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. at night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable but redoubled with vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begin to be in places gusts of snow and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication lanes in the places above.
The Vyskov region has been among the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snow removers and snow strawberries.
We can't estimate at the moment when they're rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is de rigueur in the region of the White Carpathians.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in North Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow conditions are disappearing in the Czech Republic gradually.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
Generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon
Its projectiles are laser-guided with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly shattering explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when it falls on it a deadly rain of steel chips, it can put it out of combat too.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his sighting site and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and pulls at the distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located at the office building in Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated Wednesday by the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far in the Marienbader square of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on the rue Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to consolidate another 100 jobs scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are more suitable for the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Managing Director, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is for us a key location with remarkable infrastructure".
He says that connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the Frankfurt Municipality, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relating to the place of establishment".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens) regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention early on.
“It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company,” said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in front of the owner of the building of Place Marienbader.
Ultimately, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a question of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by the Fujitsu company and the nearby "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a developer of private projects, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the Town Hall. It aroused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to serve part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specialized Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group in Tokyo is the world’s third largest provider of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to companies and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Deportation of the server by Amazon - Threats against M. Assange
Wikileaks is having more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, M. Assange, apparently stays in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever greater force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom," cyber activists at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter said Wednesday.
Shortly before, the cyber business, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used Amazon’s Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: “Great, our dollars are now being spent to take care of people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN TV, quoting Mr.'s office. Liebermann reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper, "The Guardian" reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in light of Wikileaks’ previous publications of classified information,” he said.
At the same time, M. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the platform’s use of the servers.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously. In doing so, it is putting our national security at risk and in danger life all over the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks spread the content of the stolen documents.”
The founder of Wikileaks, M. Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently called plots orchestrated by his critics the prosecution of him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly afraid for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks’ revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the advisor to the Head of Government Mr. stephen Harper stated on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the US President, Mr. Barack Obama, called it a "ridiculous and absurd" that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to look after the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” says Mr. Gibbs.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely moving to the test bench to protect its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed responsible for fighting leaks.
M. Travers is tasked with implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after Wikileaks' disclosure of diplomatic cables.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
“We have made every effort to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers has had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, that is to say in German the ice confectioner somewhat old-fashioned, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display case using a spatula, disposes it in the waffle and then begins to sell it.
To find out, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbetières founded the Ice University in 2003 so that the ice creams taken out of its machines meet everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers has had a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private ice cream.
In the midst of the midst of the midlife, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply at risk of realizing their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a business management consultant and she wants, after a few years, to get something singular from this nerve-wring profession.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Is decisive not only the good flavor, but also the silky flexibility and the right consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a hell of a dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, and then cools immediately to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: there comes out a white cream of pasteurized base, foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately beset by question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
M. Luciano warns against the fact of being misled by the spirit of the time.
The one who speaks only of ice creams "made from natural ingredients", has perhaps used stabilizers despite this: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not crunch anything but ice granules.
Some changes in the base mass are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with aromas.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and is, when added cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to using the ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of fruit ice creams are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, no more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced blend correctly picks up the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if we use peach puree with a lot of sugar, it is necessary that the amount of sugar be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the ice mixture available is simultaneously beats to make it smooth and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo smears himself with fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that an "incident like this may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has joined the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we learn well,” M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
There are reports that the chairman of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, along with other Efsa experts, are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
M. Kuiper has worked decisively to develop Efsa's test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up correspond, textually, by subparagraph, to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, at the bottom, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without a condition or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed sides.
Shortly ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, Efsa does not allow the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is one opinion that all reliable data, including industry data are used as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from making contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
M. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (Isli) based in the United States.
This organization sees itself as a neutral forum of experts who belong, among other things, to the field of science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. This is the case that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding test in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We would like to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize cause in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If we do not look for the risks, how can we discover them?" asks Mr. Then in an accusing tone.
This is also the point of view of Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are barely yet researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Hilbeck said the industry controls security research.
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on the back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the construction work stopped.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
M. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically states: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claims that by cutting it out to the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment yet.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire with stones.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared into the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guardhouse.
He said he was insulted and threatened when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for full days with the opponents of Project S21.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently won one of the parallelepiped of stone weighing on average 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of it is still crammed into the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, individuals.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could get into the trunk and trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart scandal have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of the herbal flowerbeds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"hadn't been that political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, goes around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law that he abandoned. Later, he set out to study biology before subsequently becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a quarry.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40000 tons.
He is amassing his treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
It's restraining.
Sand stones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"Formerly, they were part of the bridge from Marienbrücke to Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up the forest.
He shows a bunch of the finger: Red sandstone, before, part of the Karlsruhe train station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the gallery of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the cathedral of Saint Blasian, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat!
When M. Rongen thinks that once the stones were hand-carved and moved using simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were torn to pieces."
He has not become rich, even less wealthy.
But this quarry now employs 14 people. In addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” the waste recycler said.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle to conquer high potentials
The counter has a strong attendance.
16 students jostle to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and eating whites.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea competition, they have to talk about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-to-hand in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive in the job market and they are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talent in practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amodoses the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares the pens, sweets and cards featuring the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the way to access the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project initiated with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as an employee."
According to Mr. Saelle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive we're trying to attract students with.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," says Mr. Saddle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In many parts of the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting a kyriel of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
Graduates from engineering streams are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40 000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum relating to engineering positions will be further expanded.
Roman Dykta hunts for talent on behalf of KPMG, an auditing, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of rally-paper where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can conveniently visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who is to participate decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to M. Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to stand out from the crowd through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter that is M. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in contact with all the people who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to address their requests to our company soon," he said.
Apart from the direct cocketting carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a very classical way by participating in professional fairs where they hunt themselves brain-hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology fair,” said Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms Stübe is aware of the problem related to succession.
Currently, 35 positions are put in the competition on the company's website.
"Right now, it's very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and time consuming,” he said.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to complete professional internships or to write his/her graduation project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
That's why the company is trying to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can't do that," says Staff Chief Stübe.
Money has long been the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honor roll of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the executive conditions of employees.
The Chief of Staff Ms Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image with job seekers.
“I think the candidates rely mainly on external assessments when it comes to a potential employer,” she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to M. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to make themselves attractive is to go through your own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is to say the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When treating employees well and identifying with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and, thus, definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for now.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
It was the explosion, in April, of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" which is at the origin of this strict ban. It must remain in effect for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was prepared to allow the realization of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution want to reduce the U.S.’s dependence on foreign countries on oil supply.
The question of who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the golf course is not, to this day, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion-dollar claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freezing of the borehole that was declared after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tougher security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently being reformed in depth.
At the same time, M. Obama has announced that it will remove lucrative tax niches from oil and gas groups.
The actors in this sector of activity now publicly warn that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it is so far.
"The government's goal is to curb the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector" according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban pronounced Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with the regulations."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it exudes a smell similar to that which exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
The men live on theft, corruption and refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has good intention.
“Don’t run out,” the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: “You still have enough oil mud today in front of the water lens.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man sunk in muddy water to the chest, as well as the oily trail around him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water to the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the subsoil is full of brown slicks of crude oil.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says that, once, she was collecting shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil sprang from a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole extent of the ravages is obvious when you walk through the mangrove marshes crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits crading brown water. Whoever plunges his hand out of it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palms sadly hang their palms.
We search in vain for the clouds of birds, as we usually encounter in wetlands: As long as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls on this paradise of old that resembles a gas station by the smell it gives off.
"What's happening here is war on the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger when it comes to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The area where the Ogoni live has been a besieged battlefield for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This one was executed later. In 1993, the Shell Group had to halt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the return to the country Ogoni is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are daily pumped thanks to more than 5000 boreholes and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times large like Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water steel trestles as strange sculptures: We very affectionately refer to "Christmas trees" the heads of boreholes.
They are up to 50 years old, most are eaten away by corrosion up to the marker.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, more than two billion litres have poured into the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which flowed into the sea during the accident of the supertank tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the sabotage and siphoning of pipelines is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated oil pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner criticized the Shell group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "still much higher than alleys".
Some shapes emerge from the mangroves to a place that, seen from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of cambouis and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with cambouis up to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without pattern on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
We heat the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe of the kerosene drops fall and diesel is finally obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-liter diesel drums daily: "It brings us 34 000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta residents are leveraging the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material for free.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the network of pipelines into pierce throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small, insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: The organized crime networks that also include high-ranking politicians and military personnel, charge the lion’s share in tankers and sell it to the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather the subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, nor illegal theft and refineries.”
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only a question of the withdrawal of the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you got running," announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to enjoy raw material like all Nigerians.
"From every point of view, this damn thing has brought down our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a big security problem.
In examining a device that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the Quantas company had visibly been more fortunate so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the engines of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warns of a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil line, according to a statement published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
Concerned are Rolls-Royce-made reactors and equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among these.
The Australian airline has now filed legal proceedings against the English engine manufacturer.
She has filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court headquartered in Sydney. This gives him the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, the oil inflammation is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman. Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties involved.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily stopped three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the A380 engine as a precautionary measure.
The two-stage aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is shivering Germany: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
Of the A7 National in Flensburg, winter service staff worked permanently, but they could not overcome the snow that kept piling up.
In addition, violent gusts have swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Marine Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects this tidal wave to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the weather warning center Meteomedia has announced the level of purple alert has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars got stuck there at night.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind resulted in a traffic interruption and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees fallen on railway tracks, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport was interrupted Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds have swept the roads.
Snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany’s major airports.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport spokesman said 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are no longer numerous, despite this barely 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was stopped there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car barreled on a slippery roadway in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: The snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group’s headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of duty.
From now on, the financial group is obviously looking to recover the costs of renovations and it is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, quoting a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check if it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to rent them again later."
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already ceded its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the Twin Towers for an amount of 272 million Euros from own funds holders. She then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have swallowed, according to some indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously make a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", to about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who have perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for buried miners who have been reported to have died as a result of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to raise the bodies because the security situation of the affected well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the affected well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now the bodies could not be raised.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth in the south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, we installed 29 tables on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were flown at half-mast in front of all the public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative holiday that New Zealand has fueled the hope that the miners will come to the surface.
"But they never came home."
M. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he can't resign himself to accepting his son's death until he sees his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative festival.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Police chief Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", the fighter's epic.
What audience could the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural strength, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal assassination methods. When he is in a bad mood, he tears the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind does not say any word about its real name. Even the other characters let out, at most, at the bend of one or two sentences a few cries of appalling agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and we feast in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a shame that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher", his trilogy relating to the drug trafficker fierce and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema of art and essay.
Most art cinema supporters must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
Fans of action films die of boredom, when the blind embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with frigid images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully by the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose mobiles are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, is perhaps sent from the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims to annoy, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications for a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, much less to submit to the controls of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, because it is about the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in parallelepiped stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating back to the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby locality, el-Kibar, would be well able to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950’s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is becoming more and more thicker.
Former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was certainly sure that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but had little evidence showing this country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about it and only talk about an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he makes sure he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat from the United Nations gave only a laconic response in the summer by saying that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble from the "unused military building" and proceeded with a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered traces of uranium produced by the men in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers through a member state showing the moment that directly followed the attack, and it appears that the attacks are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the particle analysis, calling it unbelievable.
Since that time, Damascus has refused any discussion about it, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection at the el-Kibar site and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation of this case has been going on since June 2008 without a result and "is becoming more and more a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as acknowledged by a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, finally it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA considers that progress must be made to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "functional relation" to the alleged reactor.
To date, inspectors have not indicated which facilities it is here, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also named after the neighboring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in or directly from a military base, which is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors for the three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group will in fact be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve fuel production."
It would have "no indication of sensitive activities" such as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to non-enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb should have been separated later.
It is unclear whether the rubble, which could hide traces of high value, were stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land have disappeared, no one will have information about the place of storage of the rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine examined in 1998, located only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates River, to see if it may be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria has undertaken earthworks at the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began requiring access to these locations.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
In the diplomatic circles, it is said that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows what great interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful ways the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to offer these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means entails an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "Would it serve, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in time of war
It's been going bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumor is that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav War.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some footage planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie is a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR herself.
She's not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
“The meeting must be held in Bosnia,” Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says quite a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to remove the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a filming permit in Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come after this authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to speak out.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. He meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a rape victim in love with her executioner".
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie, is expressed, is "unfair and based on erroneous information".
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can give him peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot us!
Tonight, everything is fine with the Irish again.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team over-dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against the backdrop of loud music, they stumble their feet.
Baileyu-Pub de Cork in southern irland vibrates because the players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This weird show is called "beer-pong." The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to attend the World Beer-Pong Championship in January in Las Vegas.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old is looking to have fun, to turn away from the turmoiling issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange feeling, however," he said.
"The homeland is so far away and I don't have a job there."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her job desired as an event project manager, maybe a good sign" says the young man with a smile.
Because of the dark prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, her brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
The young people leave: The situation of most of the families who live on the island resembles that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are made, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980's.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes the place.
The economic crisis, however, especially affects the well-trained young Irish people who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the economic boom years.
Everyone had a job, there's excess money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities, leaves and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last to leave the light turns off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future because the government is only throwing powder in the eye and offering no future prospect to young people.
“They’re cutting minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
She sees how her classmates cling to one unpaid practical internship to another.
She states that are her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon is organizing the "WorkingAbroadExpo" show, which provides full support on the theme "Working Abroad".
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the echelons of the professional hierarchy," says the official.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a hassle, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O'Donovan, has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his homeland, as he participates in an additional workstation, so he can complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the homeland.
“The situation is already a little crazy,” he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically no longer live."
He burst with an embarrassed laugh while going through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-groomed front gardens, expensive cars from major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
“They were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything fall apart because of the credit?
O'Donovan thought for a moment, served hot tea and said, "I don't have children to maintain and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
“No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He then laughs and talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back there after seven years and, in Ireland, life was just going on."
This idea appeals to Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
On his list, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life doesn't have to be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him well in recent days: the party to be organised on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's worried she won't be able to turn into a farewell night.
“Only, not a lot of emotions,” he says, drinking a long sip of beer.
"A farewell seems worrying."
"Let's call it a goodbye night, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with a few drinks and some games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does that of private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it is tracking attitude changes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey results in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy recovered after experiencing a sharp decline in output last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year, but with a sharp increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has stood firm during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and where violent crime has worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; nevertheless, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are in this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A defiled vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country and plunged into fear.
Poll boxes and a new ballot, ballots scattered across the gutters, ransacked polling stations and intimidation were presented
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, were wandering around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Sometimes violent protests have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, had necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round of the second round.
With a raging cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250 000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Argentine President Cristina Fernández benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, visibly in mourning, that she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
M. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
The government of Mrs. Fernández lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian punched one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room for spending at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1% but many private estimates and the wage demands of the unions, see this figure close to 30%.
M. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which has made falsifications of statistics on official inflation.
Can Ms. Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18 percent.
The economy has been boosted by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a forced previous debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández see members to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which is similar to a prelude to the consolidation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If it does, it needs to gain support from the middle class, among which kirchnerism is very much advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have flowed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
Half a Hurra for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its older brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters came forward on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
M. Ma himself became a substitute for feelings over the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
M. My passing the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five town halls, he failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic-Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned towards Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50 percent of all votes for the KMT by 45 percent.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. My would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including roaring campaign trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young M. Link, purely through the face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
Strangely, it was not determined if the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by leading suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, candidates have played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stoking anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
M. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether its policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
Beijing’s government can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy of deceiving Taiwan, back to the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to host a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Certainly, she would also like to see political integration; but let us begin at the beginning.
It is better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was going to be wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison following corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided their talks could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party has a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr.'s hasty approach. My on China.
M. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for president.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must do an introspection of oneself.
The evaluations of M. Ma was weak; despite dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his office and local branches would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of the "best new artist."
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards according to which an artist must not release more than three albums before the recording; which "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, skillful hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line dotted at Spalding compared to Norah Jones' meteoric success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Award voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity” in the “instrumental album” category, a very on a thrill invigorating a recording that was one of the most important favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positotolly" of keyboardist John Beasley will be competing.
Trombone Shorty, favorite with the rauch voice of New Orleans and frequent guest at "Treme" of HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; which also tilts strongly towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, gained some well-deserved recognitions in the big category; in competition with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber jazz and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Award nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the annual 53rd Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations were Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer’s Madolin Concerto, Avner Dorman, is also up for a reward.
Classical nominations are spread over 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Symphonys No. 3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists;
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Afar" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Theatre
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at the Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his instrumental solo performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he had written the 15-minute work especially for the mandoline performer Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
“I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a large number of North African scales and rhythms,” Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination included pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-soloist nominees; here they are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic blends, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project wins the approval of the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center was in compliance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahá’ís, you mention it,” said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing themselves for or against the center, at the talking time roughly evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of the monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-foot square mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would rise 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really "foreign" life form," said Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We wonder what’s still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important when it comes to finding life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute for Planetary and Spacial Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; so it has speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances may be able to substitute for each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
“But the arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced with phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she says; so, the researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton
The other two showdogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs — two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis — disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express pickup truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday night, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told Steve Whitmore.
“The good news is that dogs are doing well,” Whitmore says.
"They are in good shape."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is ongoing."
“We don’t want to say,” Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be reached to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at an animal shelter in the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional contests this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national championate "AKC/Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions for other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's nearly a month-long canine exhibition tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs — a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell burrow and a Breton spanel — who stayed with them in the motel’s room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could take them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM awaits only the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York City officially praised the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors that about US$5 billion in debt would be erased; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal hurdles remain before MGM to get back afloat under the tutelage of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general managers of what will be a light studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a US$500 million credit facility, which is planned to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently being licensed by the investment bank, which itself is facing US$75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio’s restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to invest its finances since it could not afford to pay interest amounting to US$300 million a year.
In August, general manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a straightening expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more whose creditors were looking.
In the spring of this year, it was necessary to do everything again when the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially exits the bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already secured 1.2 million dollars, will receive a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
Cooper’s companies, which have collected $375 000 a month for their company management services, will receive a “success premium” of US$4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to revive production of MGM, which has released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265 000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of MGM’s debt, has attempted to make a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget In Balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five $99 BMX bikes and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jump strings, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club – to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It’s clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s technology toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-to-button-powered toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on your stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays take-as-yourself games like Simon Says and can do the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel blocking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80's, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to turn a ride into a car in a session with a self-correction and a valve workbook.
If you’re suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as efficiently as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), this is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and older) is a set of just five blocks larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time goes by, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based only on their presence in the toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Penguin online pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
These can be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button-to-neck microrobot.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through our dog's mouth.
Bring a softer side to policing in China
Tang Shenbin was walking through a square in the city like an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, issuing orders with military authority in a low voice.
He wanted the female members of chengguan – imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence – to convey some impression to a group of spectators.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and pants of olive color, froze at attention.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four perfectly neat hats perched at the top of hair tied by a striped bow in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they look average,” Mr. said. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a graduate degree.
Guangdong province traded the grey-green uniforms for a supposedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the eye-down by the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black glances, firmly for half an hour, until the hawker repacked his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, curve and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty drawing attention to this underground urban brigade of China
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media is portraying the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon hawker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game imbued with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in the assault of street vendors.
“Chengguan has marked the government,” China Daily lamented last year, a national publication, after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if women had real tasks or if they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged between 18 to 22, to have a beautiful figure and "the five facial features in the right order."
They must be larger than average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
The officers said the work was physically too painful for women over 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they are suitable; it is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that the height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job postings for both genders.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
How beautiful this means is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, people with disabilities or disfigured people should not apply.
"We can't let a person who can or a hunchback come to serve here," says Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has apple cheeks with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimple colleague, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply driving the vendors into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or tofu bowls as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you have to go."
"We've already told you many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle cart bike.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen chengguan police and agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from Placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming scandal.
A 15-minute standoff followed before the sinister-faced police fought their elbows to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play purely a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. says. Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the audience begins."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to an assistant in a former campaign and his efforts to get lobbying for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal over his case made national headlines last year and harmed his career.
M.'s office Ensign said he was "very happy" by the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr.'s lawyers Ensign said the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charge against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, that there is significant evidence that Mr. Ensign allegedly conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying job to win Mr.'s silence. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as Treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
M. Ensign has contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since M. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign was prohibited for one year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and M. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be at odds with the so-called lobbying door ban.
According to the evidence that has been made public, “there appears to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and a substantial violation of the revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop the lawsuits against former Senator Ted Stevens charged with failing to prosecute.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general manager of citizens for accountability and ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Sign in the case.
"This says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Senior Counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Justice Department and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the ministry was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr.'s team of lawyers Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
M. Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable getting into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr.’s parents. Ensign to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as lobbyist, Mr. Chief of Staff Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. He and Hampton said he was "hammering" the interior ministry on a disputed issue.
M. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and he asked the transportation secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as a leader in the Senate’s fourth-largest Republican.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's example and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent reports of horrific testimonies every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said that there were more than 140 000 messages about the trial of the rape case and the children tied to their bed in a house that was burned.
Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr.'s lawyers Hayes have already filed evidence in the tribunal that outlines appeal arguments that may occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and extensive use by Twitter journalists – created a “circus atmosphere”, a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with inflammatory details that the jury was misinfluenced by the public’s passions.
The request could prompt appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
“I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms violates human rights to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, Chief Lawyer.
Trial judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court, laconically rejected the claims in last week's ruling, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling that was landmark, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his ruling that there was an "atmosphere of carnival at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts seized to review Mr.’s conviction half a century later. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale trials, J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says some appeals judges could be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many described by Mr. Mr.'s lawyers. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; which delays enforcement.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes allegedly suffered harm when Justice Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of criminal scenes during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he abusively put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate in a weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was being discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept stoking the flames of the deal's emotion.
“The daily stamping of media tweets, cameras and journalists outside the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “did not look like anything that had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said the claim that the instant news was more incendiary than the statements delivered more slowly was a Luddist view that would impoverish the court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments that social and technological change required court adaptation.
Mr.'s lawyers Hayes insists on this claim.
In their case, they make a reference to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of media coverage of the trial and clarified that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote," said Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civility bring the divides closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a warning sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the swift return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences of the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points empty of partisan point rating.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the committee on the president’s deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcendent of the ideological divide; but which, however, further divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a period of trial and mutual testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed in the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism hangs over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warned that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session would not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress met in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of Washington’s toughest tasks and, in their view, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group; which suggests that there is on tax issues, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston is planning two phases in the fights between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, given that Republicans are challenging Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; and then being followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Whoever is judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But it would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990’s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and takes to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protective money it collects, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy — what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” — takes its part as money drives up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yury Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there have since been little trace of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits on these charges.
In September, he told the following on a Russian TV channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be up to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to name it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,” according to the embassy’s note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the Moscow City Government Bureaucracy.
"Analysts to identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report says the FSB is brewing money from the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small.
A source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law. "
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note states that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their belongings close under one pretext or another.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption but he admitted the little progress.
The embassy's memo reports reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
“In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats,” Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow’s think tank in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because there is no such class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would amount to more than 300 billion dollars a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the U.S. embassy note, which was only carried out yesterday, late in the evening Moscow time, will stir with certainty discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to what U.S. diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
“The problem is that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with poorly decrepit concrete walls, the director of the Anlong Veng Secondary School mentioned the man who had built him, the last chef of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in north-western Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally being questioned to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence for a former Khmer Rouge member, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the "Duch".
Faced with this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng; complicating the reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There are resentments and fear among the ancient Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrown the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and his army fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrilla warfare of their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into black misery, common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down their arms, they are unqualified farmers with the low rank and record.
“These people have benefited from very little follow-up after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the regime's agrarian utopian ideology."
"They were raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
The court is expected to begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, in early next year.
The court's mandate is to try senior leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reported to have died.
Recently, on a steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field located near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried-up grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court pursues several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces,” he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A 75-page history of Democratic Kampuchea."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for higher education, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at the college of Anlong Veng, said the new textbook helps students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came back with the book at home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he said.
"They're suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone saleswoman, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many locals go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and, later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to abandon its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world
The agreement was leaked in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter by about 500 pounds, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, held at Obama’s initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic in the wake of the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Nuclear Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal “a very significant, important step” by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium,” Mr. Lukashenko.
"This is our product... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, by showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1 300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent US$13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“Competitive coordination and organization has been implemented to build confidence,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official with the Department of Energy specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Center, Belarus has at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to phase out its inventory by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has not objected to CIA flights
The government has raised no objections to CIA thefts with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exerting adequate vigilance on the foreign planes that crossed Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, took place a meeting between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Government of Zapatero's offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken by surprise," Aguirre said in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of External Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González forwarded to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports contain no incriminating evidence, no sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between the Governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007 during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of Interns, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoid comments of a fiery rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern for the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” she said.
The parricide that passed to the confession complained in network of the "overwhelmingness" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician terror"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she uses as soon as she was little, communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she is from.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, you have to know your sentimental life, that ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iván Túñez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected official was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
With him, she lived together for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the job market, the little one stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll fractured, they separated.
In March of 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and upset about the fact that I came to work."
“When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course he now realizes what means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come home this month or you'll give me an address to send you the child."
She complains: "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take him when I get home," she said.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until 19, because the 20 I have to show up at a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her senior with her.
“He will stay with the correct person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” doubtful intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on 1 of that month, and he had supposedly been murdered on 10, died.
"Cesar is happy on one side, but he's not happy with another."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the child) a few hours ago and so I'm saving some babysitter money."
17, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when will you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
The 30, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances money for me".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Galician terror (epigraph)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything was gone so that she hadn't told him about the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, from the judicial inmate centre in Menorca.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and laid her corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The members of the People’s Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these comics normally doubles the one it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan populars won 610.473 votes to the generals of 2008, while at the autonomics of 2006, they had obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the CPP received 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the CSP and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this party calculated the fact that, if there would be a general election, the CPP could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 MPs (it would lose no more than 9 members)
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC would lose a member of Parliament - he has three now - while ICV would keep a member of Parliament or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May of 2011 for municipal comics, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would also not get the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its voting number in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Popular have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven inmates in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerien held by agents of the General Information Police of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, among which "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the perpetrator of the bombings in Bombay that caused the death of 106 people
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that, with "Operation Kampai" has "been debilitated" the international falsification apparatus of Al Qaeda and "therefore, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network held operational in Europe, which is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be in the following days blows similar to that recorded on the night of Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistanians were detained Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerien Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand there was another, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikan.
They were the ones who ran from Bangkok the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that satisfied the conditions marked by the name "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be in the name of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connects detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", has been one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, Catalonia was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after by the integrals of the "commando" which killed 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend fiscal complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which are summarized to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to make himself loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the parties that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the inauguration.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend on the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an inauguration "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and separatist discourse", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas's inauguration will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the dead were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility of their night nurse killing more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be that of being able to exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the processual situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discreditation that the entity may suffer for not detecting in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - because he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of any other person that the accused is not."
The person already named as the "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused him death by injecting him with a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pellets.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the center to medicine.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a death less cruel or by the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he made with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of confessed assassinations, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of the way of killing after having successfully committed eight assassinations.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of the justice system to clarify the scope of the facts.
BCE threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the threat of yesterday of Trichet that warned that "markets should not underestimate our capacity to react".
The differentials of the peripherals have closed to force and the shares of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate BCE's ability to be wrong and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative position fences.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the plan to purchase public debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, he hope that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" will be extended and the quarterly auction with unlimited access to be maintained at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase program will continue and even signal it to be intensified.
If they do not meet the expected generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a further collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of trafficking a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to the 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the gills of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, double that the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Support Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "except for being, to appear."
Courage, we can get out!
Eulen's president will challenge Vega Sicilia's counsel asked by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict in the bosom of the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers him "no law", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding for the companies does not appear to be willing to give in in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From its board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders of January 18 this year whose dispute is registered in the Trade and Companies Register.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict resolves, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through a processual argument, clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically null and void on January 18," according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that, once the assembly is held, is challenged by considering that it is "single by right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate will convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez’s sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless solicits usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for challenge for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In the first moment, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, no longer the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from the high motoristic competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines from everyone's manufacturing plants, energy stations, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a short, near-real-time” time, changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today work 180 young professionals of high qualification who, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from virtual reality from simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull established the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this assignment has 580 people, including two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Formula 1 hero from Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notoriety.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that R+D progress in the case of race cars brought the 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots bring the 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to set up 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with the Barcelona third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has assured that the philosophy for the implementation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, supporting, post-sale and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program on a global level that solves the possible problems of HP’s computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, because the major companies have already contracted technical support services," Helena Herrero said.
Sabadell bets on 'steal' one million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell’s managing director, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in the margins of interest, which will be tried to partially compensate with increments of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell waits to capture in three years a million particular customers, his task at hand.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and to be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new master plan that will hold a three-year ability.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public subsidies from FROB, is to gain a market rating by the capture of one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduce those who can leave the bank -, its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rating to individuals is 3.5%, while to companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as a target, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has disturbed all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize his Optima master plan this year, establishes four years ago, even though initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more exercise.
Customers who let out savings banks will be his main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking case, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of liabilities - which penalizes margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and caisses pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will solicit larger dimensions."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He says capital requirements are "greaking up enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentioned that the FROB can replace the market in the receipt of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the time end of the markets, he has diminished the importance of a few banks already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that we cannot issue, but on the contrary of what happened in June, we can obtain short-term financing through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the coffers
The managing director of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is carried out.
When the merger of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers were carried out, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of them have been carried out completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," said the leader.
In the declarations during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest speed possible and we must be very satisfied in the way that it is realized in the time frame that has been fixed in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain"
“The passage of 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million in asset volume at 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The director general of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and he has attributed to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The manager mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector did well from the stress tests that BCE carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have caused a two-way government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new adjustment methods, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or the abolition of 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of NEA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, is uniting Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany we are beginning to speculate on the three possible exits of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, nearly a 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought we should do (tax rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second blow from the Central European country was when Merkel had difficulty extending the decision to save Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and publication it were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, asking for the reform of the Union treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time force private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think to cross.
And it tells us all that, even if now we have to take measures with which we may not be too much to agree, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a severe growth path with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of renewing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asked is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence brings to us a greater tranquility.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it from this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with the big companies and the announcement yesterday of the new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms of Merkel, we have opened the way to the thesis that must be put in order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we are considering, we cannot exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone too full of countries that are not serious.
And in this case, Germany can always tell us that she had warned us about it.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has made a lot of ink about the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team already made clear), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players will make the regulatory sanction during the next match of the play-off match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards at the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee sanctioned with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case related is due to the fact that this has had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem displays the nobility and honor and which on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to its dilated history.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of conduct does not expressly prohibit by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, if with these actions we commit a fraud of law; because, in fact, they are respectful actions with the sports regulations, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sportsmanship.
One of the properties that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these properties to which we allude with the correct game is to prevent the team of the infractor players from benefiting unfairly from the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not agree to what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that offenders get from the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to find that we do not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and we do not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action the players perform a sanction match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the boxes occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the ladder is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sportsmanship, from which is still part of the taking of strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose rather the time in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or running away from it.
Even if the boundary between genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there have been two self-evictions and because of the way to transmit the director to provoke them.
The evil provoked by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offers offensive to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financing celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tune and the lottery, when December arrives also come back the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive and adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete to complicate the accounting, this year's schedule (as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (on 17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying from their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers have the tendency to go down a level with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions in the centre, there is the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic demand boom for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another most powerful group, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices of last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in billing since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the bosses of Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, confides in the possibility of starting to see the final of the tunnel and maintains that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks filtration confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program is causing Washington.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
This is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report ahead of the visit of former National Security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some of the Taliban-attacked nuclear facilities, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is being considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Externals during a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani production of nuclear weapons.
A depay from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", argues: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, said: “Despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it clear to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end with the tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for the leader of Wikileaks
Obama will incur a senior counterterrorism official to avoid further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order of arrest.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’ creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20 the international police force having the siege in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of that country.
For example, the 188 countries of Interpol have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a free route for the arrest - which the national police body must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is located.
The movement outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder showed himself willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by video-conference.
They also recall that Assange solicited and obtained the permit to get out of the prosecutor from Sweden of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's chief of security.
“This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
While the world is looking for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he gave an undetermined location an interview with the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they are spying on at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not at all sure why we should be interested in the opinion of a guy with a web page,” he said.
Obama himself has instructed a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s trial to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House in January, has asked the State Department to consider the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to come back to his statements after he said Assange should "be murdered."
“Obama should turn it into a goal and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that.”
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in the government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment,” he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as dilute as his liar and that this absolutely cannot give him headaches that he had with other currents extinguished.
That's why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with winks that allow him to arm himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 ERC national councillors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the Carodists want to carry a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the rank leader wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand the president a little more than to make his position available to the militance, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document, which management will submit to the National Council for vote on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the autumn of 2011, which leaders consider a safe fact.
The leader of ERC has confessed that "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to make that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he emphasizes two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militance, that is, include new figures that come from the sector adept of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidates the assembly once and for all as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the model assembly, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession with the team of Puigcercós, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulse of 2008 instructed the management to revise the model of assembly in a specific congress of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this subject.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the state of Mexico.
Between the murders we mention these three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases is mentioned that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of fire and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage port of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the Naucalpan municipality.
Early in the morning Thursday, the four, the owners of land exploited in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the autotrack near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the Villa Guerrero municipality.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he left his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On November seven, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a shot-and-the-head impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, a municipality in Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead, a man was found on a lonely path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body a bullet was found with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
Emergency bodies carried out a comprehensive search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and blindfolded.
The man had a wound produced by a gunshot in the neck.
Halfway through the month, two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle were reported in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the Atizapán de Zaragoza municipality, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a box of cardboard box that contained a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On 17, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet Zoquiapan of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the morning after the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover was located, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreeing with a message that his executioners had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man in the zinacantepec municipality with at least three bullet holes and a message signed by a criminal group was found at the end of the month, at the end of the month, with at least three bullet holes.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head wrapped up and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country’s representative in COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and has detailed that it maintains its supply of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to between 40 and 45 percent until 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions between 40 and 45 percent before 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, said.
In his first public appearance in the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he explained, the last four years his country has inverted 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution-building and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy savings targets, energy efficiency and emission reductions.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans in progress or completed, both funded by the Chinese government as by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Energy Efficiency Use Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economical lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of this country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than what is thought.
For example, he said, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for the 9% of the historical contribution in contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one around 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion from Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to apply to the National Order Commission to claim what the right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to apply to the National Order Commission to demand what the right.
In the interview prior to the protest taking of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where one should elect a successor.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal,” he said.
The panic leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we savor it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elegate the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the note "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party's president's office to any of the five."
He predicted that the relaunch recorded by the party in the past elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next dispute, even if "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have been "a lot of hopes regarding them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four-year government, César Nava asked the prisits to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they are starting to defend them; that they are coming out of the ‘cupboard,’” he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditory, because in the country there is no gag, much less censorship.
Obama promotes law in Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call you senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama said.
His short message keeps a cyber link open with a larger document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agency can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must solve this tax problem before the end of the year..."
“I think we can get a deal at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will call for a "closing vote to the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have remained in that country for the past five years and they have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the help of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project that are in intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and incumbent Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office on Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they will not support him on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
While the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles in the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which the participants displayed the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language).
The finger on the wound "...embarrassssses us", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what is the "wound", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my forte, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath away in the middle of the hallway, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolism is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "on the wound I could only know that it is that is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a beautiful narrative that he entitled Éloge à l'invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at one time is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous bewitcher who touched clouds, made people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a damsel had lost, a narrative that saw to speak America, the great news that had from the beginning his own chroniclers and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
“Cervants who invented all of us [the writers] mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in another way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that was even lacking in modesty.
Nevertheless, he stressed, "crazy and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narration belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It is thanks to his heritage that we are what we tell."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with his round table The Duty on the Sore.
The Cuban-portorican has put hers on the great wound of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is a little yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuancer means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very convenient thinking about caricature, white and black, established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano hunting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had ups and downs in his career, but he knew how to reach the decisive series three times, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine finally consoled himself with the medal of sub-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist arrived at his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a loss, as his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump in the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his tournament rival, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the helmsman said when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot from the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can not
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad trick, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety to hold the title in our hands, it has escaped us, it has escaped us
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be an underchampion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the procedure for processing visas at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (VSAs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the visa processing and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars in the case of visas with application (includes visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for visas of traders and investors.
Individuals who wish to renew their visa will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Because the biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service rate of 26 dollars.
For more information on the new procedure for applying for the visa, visit the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA to announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has quoted the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 a.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile ambients that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if his living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an ambient that was thought to be too venomous for any life form, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Of any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
At the conference will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, which studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective of that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, we make possible the arrival of 'bipartisan', we denounce.
The 60th had just settled when in the Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, de PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'toned' against the reform of the Organic Law, for it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, they initiate 'bipartisanship' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four deputies, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by the PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way the political marginality of PRI and PAN is being constituted.
He mentioned that in the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the pattern from a political will and if they do not have it, they will be enslaved again by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
"So far has arrived (the opposing coalition), that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 lawmakers and they are now talking to other colleagues to be more numerous, the Convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now Congress has turned into a 'loot' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by cupular agreements outside at 5 which will probably be 9 deputies, now to the five that we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Town Hall of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles pesos favors Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this one, the amount that was paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipe, this last check number 9258447 was issued the past 16 November for the amount of 200 mil 144,56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of account providers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favor of Camacho Palzuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Gazette of the State, according to the forecasts of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used his services again.
All this, after July 25, Noroeste had published a revision of the checks that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the meantime March 2008 - July 2010, in the trennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality to pay Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
The tourist sites must be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Merchants Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked that the image of the destination be neat and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor state of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the disorder and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the wealth you lose, elsewhere they don’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipe will have to take responsibility and prevent it from going again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and only do the fix," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact emphasizes something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive to be able to add to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
The business sector of Mazatlán seeks a decent working legislation free of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and confronts great problems.
Yesterday was installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new integrals of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront each other.
"We hope that MPs will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to look after their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor in place to advance.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is that of pushing and adding forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, generate stimulus for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism activity, he called for the new legislators to give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understood that this is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as a major economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and which directly rivals the agro-industry."
Apart from the need to classify resources to detonating tourism projects that help give the state security and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the wishes of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Wid Kings will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, for their home is formed by nothing more than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' for sale in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests waist-cut clothing for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, my son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana recalls with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, puts on the waist 12; Isaías, 10 years old, shoes the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, puts on the waist eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of the waist five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream come true of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign On Seeking King Mage, by giving a toy or money at the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in the Eastern Townships on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged heads of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were scheduled to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The search took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that has allowed us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Board took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government said should address the issue of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated when the three opposition parties said Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting was held.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year to be detained, anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is attacking the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do,” Mr. said. Duceppe.
The NDP's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has dismissed criticism that her party is not firm enough regarding illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are overwhelmingly telling MPs that they are not tolerant of this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
A Conservative told the QMI Agency, however, that the government would ask for a vote so that every member of Parliament who opposes would then explain himself before his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not new: Quebec City would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this subject as early as January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services of Quebec, on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It did not take more for the PQ critic for public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a solution tinkered on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it," he just said.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"Plus M. Charest insists that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide, "he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign from Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break this impasse, he suggested that Quebec City give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cards of the Charest government.
Quebec City would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some of the amendments related to this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several streams remain under high surveillance because of heavy rainfall in several areas of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated preemptively.
In the evening, another slip would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since this precipitation must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear of the overflow of several streams.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of Chêne, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was washed away because of heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on a high alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamé
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Council on Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as his crude language on the air.
The CBSC considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some remarks contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for programs broadcast during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Joint Front of Assisted Socially.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Facilitators must present strong rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a gesture of coward.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the implicated episodes of "Dupont le midi" have addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was held against him.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said he had made no donation to help Haitians because we could not know for sure that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this."
“My file has been blank for a year and a half,” the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will have to, among other things, announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing rides on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, settled in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve in professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security guard and as a clerk for UPS has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Amateur World Championship (WKA) from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he explained.
"Currently, I'm getting ready to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
“The fighters who finished in the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited.”
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
“In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament fifth, when I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added.
"What's interesting is that I've progressed every time I'm competing."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will definitely respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded 450 million dollars in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium made up of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor which obtained the largest, that of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium called Energy stewardship was formed in 2004 in a way that is concomitant with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5 billion dollars.
In early 2005, the Energy Management consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing higher prices.
"This is the new way of collusion and breaking down the competition."
“That is, people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says he hardly sees how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my journey,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “dishonest” and had “failed to rigor.”
She said that "it would be the least the least" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of consortia is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The work is underway and is expected to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortia to be counted, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau, for example, Dessau, in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Stewardship consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the James Bay territory responds to particular workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to them in a special way since the 70's."
The big boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JEBS), gave an explanation that raised eyebrows about the fact that the project's stewardship contract was awarded over the counter.
"If you go on tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in that market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that's important, it's people's skills," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50 000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the $295 131 564 stewardship contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "fund" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development players, but also fair trade brands and environmental certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he is immersed in a media universe where messages in favor of a more responsible consumption are rampant, he deplores a credible lack of information, a lack that he even describes as a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the Sherbrooke University.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed to so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of products and brands displaying themselves as eco-friendly, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumption information seems essential to stimulate this part of consumption currently animated by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and doubtful nature of the information would calm the ardors of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
On the other hand, a third of Quebecers are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are sought to be put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At the height of 61%, they also favored purchases from traders in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported having used public transit or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A state loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus Company and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but only on a loan.
The Angus Development Corporation and the Parallel, which hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving it its full cinephilic vocation, do not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be below initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state's pharmacies.
A first action plan and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris file.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm’s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to answer it.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be ruled out.
Recall that the Association of Owners of Cinemas and Cinema Parks of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministère de la Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community were seeking substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, carried for ten years the cinema of authors in his premises of the complex after having financed his construction himself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of cinemas for independent films is glaring in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to retain its customers.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700 000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27 by screening the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des Dieus.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals down there.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. sees as the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but they also betray the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
For example, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-U.S. relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, relates how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
M. Wilkins offers some explanation for this.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may affect Canadian political leaders talking about everyday domestic issues rather than focusing this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically,” he said, “the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote.”
The other expression of this feeling of importance can be read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the vote of confidence in the federal budget in early February, through which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a 30-40 billion-dollar stimulus package,” wrote Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is it that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties were making its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus package.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC are sending back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border shows, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which we observe unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the kidnappings for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
M. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it was written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the file."
Finally, it should be noted that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for the massive leak should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) that accounts for almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (LEDs or "LEDs" in English), most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have embarked on voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to manage to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade to avoid that it becomes out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, we reduce this energy need by twice again.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, which gives an idea of the possible saving with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have shown reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and that they should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the compact fluorescent light bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of the electoral results in nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines set expire.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN chief.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission allowed Wednesday midnight’s deadline to pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s election.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of the CIS had said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former Forces nouvelles (FN) rebellion since the failed coup d'état of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters practiced by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are withheld by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, considered "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the release of the results because he knows he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from releasing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held accountable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the lead of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% by counting the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolitan France.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is up 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, increased to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over a year) and 25% by including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of ILO.
The elderly experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months as well as over a year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the French overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds benefited from a stability of unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including overseas departments) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste treatment company executive and brother of the PS chairman of the general council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and imprisoned at the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, trading in influence and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wishes to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before the hearing of his client.
M. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, required, through his lawyers, to put the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted Wednesday night and jailed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than to operate the discharges he had to manage.
As for the awarding of contracts or the purpose of funds related to their operation, he never became aware of them, said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that are being accused of him."
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been indicted and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with judicial supervision for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted one for "subtraction and embezzlement of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "concealed abuse of social property".
Among those who were confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for suspected fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held the public in suspense in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for the treatment of their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not had for consideration the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the American justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in a harsh light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was not.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée's advisor on strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly held nationals in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "hammer constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because, past the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in delay maneuvers".
M. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230 000 euros of bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for twelve days, but remains stranded in Iran.
An information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is calling for extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, by decision of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of nuclear program equipment, Majid Khakavand’s expansion is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There was lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the decision" judicial, he observes.
M. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "narrow" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée spares no effort, through press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit since several press articles pass on the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes the "blitz" media of French officials.
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, wonders the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then examines the reasons why the Elysée has poured into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved.
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in promoting the release of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under the age of 16, representatives of the ministries of culture and the family said.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
“We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, the minister’s official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents are requesting them, the official added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report miscellaneous facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the organizing countries
In the midst of turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday designated the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice where struggles of influence and lobbying risk taking the leap on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of FIFA competition will take place in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 one will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC handed a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to dissatisfy FIFA and embarrass English officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of government hopes to reissue the successful blow by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the organization of the 2012 Olympics in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore the English coat of arms to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries’ grim economic and financial outlook could shower their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a heavy underdog despite the shortcomings of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a thinly veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. said. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appears as the logical favorites.
The world's largest economic power, the seat of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have separately built a very nice project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat is that the granting of the World Cup-2026 to China, eagerly desired by FIFA, which would effectively nullify the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV fees paid (due to jet lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the obvious
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made it look like he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate at the Elysée calls another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then we must act as if the doubt still exists.
In one way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
That he evokes before parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" has therefore sowed a little feverishness.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken about the presidential election, in the tone of humor, in such meetings.
"At the worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His remarks the day before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If they get comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But this is not the entry of Ségolène Royal who pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many of the PS are calling for an earlier than expected battle order.
The wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," the prime minister's entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
"If he believes the defeat possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to specify the modalities of exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis is forcing, the Frankfurt issuing institute will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory under penalty of exacerbating a more than tense situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the ECB's active role in resolving the government debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection for my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no more clear about his intentions, merely indicating that the program of purchase of state securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have bought 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a significant change in course.
While loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited cash allocations under generous terms and for durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this scheme to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program."
“Otherwise it would be taking the risk of causing new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, a Commerzbank economist.
“A phase-out announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds to animate a sluggish market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a runaway yield paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is making a round back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a little yesterday, with the decline in 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of the region said they had heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable", which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday, the gap with German long-term rates had reached the record of 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the gap with German rates was above 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "severely concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, putting the risk of the state not being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is respectively 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken,” said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, Italy’s administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“There is no problem in the immediate future, neither on the short nor in the long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, editor’s note), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
A period that would then be not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde hammered it again yesterday as part of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that it was again demonstrated Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously in solidarity, determined, committed to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, the détente recorded yesterday on the rates of European government bonds has brought water to the government and ECB mill.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs in particular on banking systems,” say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Political time is much slower than market time.
Aware of this gap and the dangers it holds, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
And this also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market crosshairs (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors of developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, he certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first EFSF securities issues are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries that are on the front line, Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both of them wish to avoid asking for international aid before putting in place their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
European donors, finally, talk about the options available to accelerate the process of standardization of sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first step forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to give the hand to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, consider that an extension of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with 60 billion euros to date.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snowy episodes still create traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are noticeable enough to create traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departmental vehicles have been banned from heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking his vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the coming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion is mentioned for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally come to the first additions.
The 2010 Amending Finance Act, discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements planned to find the beginning of this money.
There are two of them: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, reads the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is quantified: "The proceeds of this tax are 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase the product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
Would that pay off how much?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these fiscal resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," reads the statement of reasons.
At the SGP, we can't find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenue (the two taxes, ed.), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, we explain."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn as you go."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenged hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals itself an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file constituted by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's sinisterly cartoonish profile had long been for sketchmaking cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do new research (nor does it know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism only believe in what they already know, and who reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (otherwise he might be, what do I know, editor at Libération), who retains as true only what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek was publishing the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call themselves or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small performance exercises, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore him.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore does not put the victims in crisis as much as the "exeembrals".
But let’s come to the deep nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell's time, one could conceive of any power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely true since, being able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a vengeful of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the opportunity to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is true, also, that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret empty of secrecy, because belonging to the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to remove all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big on Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put online any reserved information - this would be tantamount to publishing it on a poster stuck to the corner.
But it is also obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state flew and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable routes, being wearing only messages learned by heart or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: at the bottom, the attempt to spy on the Watergate has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (phones).
The (analog) video cassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a step-by-step film, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow you to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travels it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and communication techniques go back to the horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is hacking its promises of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the fulfilment of the promises of rapidly released financing (so-called fast-start or early financing) made by developed countries.
And the big French hacks are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide US$30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU took the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciable and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose procedure France blocked.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered the year 2009 to be a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France believes that the funding for "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' spending or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to meet its commitment to “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that 1 € loaned is equivalent to 1 € given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission mitigation that are based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that we give... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (equivalent to an interest rate) should be counted under its liabilities.
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 € to satisfy its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to make it believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early funding is only a small, relative short-term issue, compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be another grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance the discussions on long-term financing issues (other crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would be likely to increase the level of international trust needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (ex-Movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the food generally consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, were reviewed by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as carcinogenic as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EPs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, we can clearly see in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenya's green beans, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread baguette and chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktails" "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Greens (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "facing the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
