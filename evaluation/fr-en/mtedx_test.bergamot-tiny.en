Good evening.
Our planet is 70 percent covered with the ocean, and yet, strangely, we chose to call it "Earth."
The poet Heathcote Williams has a much more objective and less anthropocentric vision, when he says, "Sece from space, the planet is blue.
Viewed from space, it is the territory, not men, but whales."
And yet, we all come from the ocean.
It's the cradle of life, even if we've forgotten it.
The ocean is everywhere: in glaciers, rivers, groundwater, in the cells of living beings, and in our veins.
Strangely, it was John Fitzgerald Kennedy who illustrated it quite well, in this quote: "It's an interesting biological fact that everyone has in the veins an equal percentage of salt in the blood, the one that exists in the oceans.
So we all have salt in our blood, our sweat, our tears.
We're connected to the ocean, and when we go back to the sea, whether it's to navigate, or to look at it, we go back where we came from. ”
And yet, this ocean, we know it very, very badly.
It's still a strange, strange, foreign world, sometimes scary.
That said, in fact, it's far from being an inert body of water, an expanse of water that's useless.
In fact, it is marine life that makes this ocean a major climate regulator, the main carbon sink, and also the main producer of oxygen.
Between 50 and 70 percent of oxygen comes from the ocean.
So, actually, more than one in two inspiration that you take, you owe it to the ocean.
Not quite the ocean.
In fact, you owe it to marine life.
Marine life is it that allows this mass of water, precisely, not to be just a mass of inert water, but to be this machinery that allows us to live.
And marine life is part of phytoplankton, which provides oxygen to large whales, to large predators, tuna, dolphins... And among these species, there are some that are ecologically larger than others, especially sharks.
That's, then, the example I chose because it's an animal that we tend to demonize, a sea monster.
And yet, every year, 70 million sharks are massacred.
It's like exterminating the equivalent of France.
But sharks are record times.
They're 470 million years old.
This means concretely that, for 470 million years, all of life in the ocean has been shaped by, and according to sharks.
And as a top predator, a keystone species, when you remove sharks from an ecosystem, you have a collapse of marine biodiversity.
So where sharks are gone, we have dead waters, or we have jellyfish explosions, but we don't have any lives.
That's it.
That's the role of predators.
We, as humans, tend to look at the top predators.
And yet, we are far from predators, since, in Nature, predators are, on the one hand, regulated by the availability of their prey -- but that is no longer the case for us since we invented agriculture and animal husbandry -- on the other hand, predators tend to reproduce less.
So cheetahs or lions are going to have far fewer small ones than mice or rabbits.
Mice and rabbits are prey, naturally, so they need to reproduce very quickly, and in very large numbers.
Sharks, whales, dolphins, are predators.
They were not designed to be prey.
We've made prey of it.
So they can't, in fact, survive man's predatory pressure.
There is also something common to all these marine animals, whether they are predators or not.
It is that they all participate in marine life, that is, a life cycle, unlike us.
To give you an example of blue whales, a blue whale produces, every day, 3 tons of excrement -- excreta that's very rich in nitrogen or nitrogen -- and that's the essential nutrients for phytoplankton that provides us with the oxygen we breathe.
In fact, 40 percent of the phytoplankton population has been lost over the last 50 years, largely because whales have been exterminated in the 20th century and before, but even more so with the invention of the explosive harpoon.
The man, on the other hand, goes to sea.
It's not part of this ecosystem.
We have not been part of it since we left the ocean.
So we're an intruder.
We are an intruder with fishing, predation means, which are, today, industrialized.
And we're a predator that no longer has the natural boundaries of predators.
So we're over seven billion, and today, seven billion people want to eat fish.
So this is a big problem.
The other problem is this illusion that we have had for a long time, and that we may still have, but less and less, that in fact, marine life is limitless.
Jules Michelet, who wrote a fairly well-known book, which is a reference in the matter, illustrates it quite well: "On certain narrow passages, one cannot row, the sea is solid.
Million million, billions of billions that will dare to venture to guess the number of these legions.
It is said that once, near Le Havre, a single fisherman found 800,000 of them one morning.
In a port of Scotland, 11,000 barrels were made in one night. ”
When we read the historical testimonies, we are told that off the Atlantic, French coast, we saw whales pass for days, the boats had to stop.
Those near the coast did not sleep, sometimes, so the breath of whales made noise.
Today, when you see a fin, you're amazed.
We lost our memory of what the sea was before we started fishing.
Here's also a quote from Thomas Huxley that illustrates the lack of knowledge and denial that we were in: "Nothing we do can affect the number of fish. ”
And yet, today, we've already exterminated 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean.
The problem, too, is that it's hard to have empathy for fish.
It's already hard to save whales.
Whales are charismatic animals with great capital sympathy.
Yet, today, in 2016, they continue to die under explosive harpoons, despite moratoriums, despite sanctuaries.
This is one of the main battles of Sea Shepherd because we consider that if we can't save whales, it's going to be very complicated to save anything else in the ocean, much less sharks that you consider monsters, or tuna, which we're not interested in.
Fish are so discredited that they are referred to in terms of tonnes.
So we're going to talk to you about 13,000 tons of quotas, 13 000 tons of tuna, or 15,000 tons of sharks.
You would be shocked if I were to talk tons of giraffes, or tons of dogs, or tons of... French.
Fish are not even considered individuals.
It is simply a mass that is part of a stock, which it is possibly a question of preserving, in order to make as profitable as possible a sustainable exploitation.
So.
One might wonder, to think that, in the end, if the fish disappear, if the ocean is going badly, anyway, we are well.
There are many of us.
We're everywhere.
Yet we must be wary because there are misleading signs.
In fact, the above-mentioned extinction of a species is several factors, including these three, that are the main: the population explosion, the overexploitation of resources, and the occupation of all ecological niches, that is, the spread everywhere.
Maybe it reminds you of someone...
In fact, if you're looking for an example of an endangered species, it's not worth looking on Google, you look in a mirror, or you're looking at your neighbor.
So we're not going so well.
Today, we are being told about sustainable fisheries.
And yet, United Nations scientists predict a collapse of fisheries by 2048.
2048, it's 32 years, so it's... tomorrow morning.
What does a fisheries collapse mean in practice?
It means more fish.
It doesn't just mean that on the menu, you won't have any more fish or that when you go into the fishmongers, they'll be empty, it means the death of the ocean.
Because, as I explained earlier, before being a food source for anyone, fish, like marine life, are the essential working-class force that allows the ocean, precisely, to be that extraordinary machinery that allows us to live.
Imagine you had to do without more than one in two breathing.
Imagine that all this carbon dioxide that is captured in the ocean, which is even more important than what is captured by forests, is found in the atmosphere.
In fact, that would be the end of human civilization.
So...
Basically, I gave you reasons, I gave you very down-to-ear, we're going to say, why the ocean is to defend.
Finally, the solution is quite simple, for us, for everyone.
If you do not depend directly on fish for life, the best thing is to refrain from eating them.
Seven billion people will never be able to eat fish.
Marine life will be exterminated.
So that's when you think in a utilitarian way, because the leitmotif is this: if the ocean dies, we'll die.
So, if we want to live, and we want our children to live after us, we're going to have to take radical steps, and we're going to have to change our lifestyles, to "adapt."
This is the watchword of evolution and species that want to survive.
As Darwin told us, adapt or die.
So we're going to have to adapt, and we're going to have to adapt quickly.
But, in a personal capacity, what motivates me, in all this, and what makes me, in front of you, tonight, is not so much this question of survival, utilitarian, laudable, but utilitarian.
In fact, it is rather... this difficulty that I have to live with this injustice that is inflicted, in fact, on everything that is weaker than us, and I find that it is morally and ethically, the engine that drives me - an injustice that is very well described by Milan Kundera, in this quote from "The Unbearable Lightness of Being":
The true moral test of humanity -- the most radical, which is so deep that it escapes our gaze -- is its relationship with those at its mercy: animals.
And it was here that the fundamental bankruptcy of man occurred, so fundamental that all the others flow from it... Thank you."
(Applause)
My daily life is made of sensations that most of you are unaware of.
For a long time, I was ashamed of it.
I remember very well the circumstances in which I discovered this difference.
I was 4 years old and I wanted to express to my mother the joy I felt when I looked at the sun through a leaf and I told her not about the leaf as such, but about the colors and sensations that were caused by what I had felt when I saw the leaf: these yellow and green lines, this very particular taste, halfway between sugar, mint, cucumber,A golden fog, joy like shimmering water... she just thought I was crazy.
And then, so, I hid it and growing up, I was frustrated to keep these perceptions that seem very beautiful to me and I tried to represent them in this painting that you see.
Immediately, thinking of these emotions, I also found those I had felt when listening to this music, Verdi's Va Pensiero.
(Music) Synesthesia is not a disease, it's just a different perception of things that leads senses that normally are not connected to each other.
For example, you hear the music note mi, and you see it blue or green.
You taste an apple and the taste of this apple will evoke a geometric shape.
It's innate and it's involuntary.
There is a multitude of different synesthesias, this would apply from assessments discussed about one person out of 2000; discussed because most synesthetes do not know to be an apethetate until they discover the existence of the phenomenon.
Thanks to my synesthesia, my emotions, my thoughts, my associations of ideas, as you can see, my little inner voice, everything appears to me in the form of colors, shapes, tastes, movements.
It enriches the perception of the world and the paintings I'm trying to represent all of this are pretty much as true about the original perception as a stop on images compared to a 3-hour film or a photo of chocolate cake compared to a real chocolate cake.
But it's still much more meaningful than words.
Words say nothing about the world and that's what I've tried to paint in this painting: at the bottom on the left, you have the real, the emotions that it inspires me, the thoughts, above, the imagination; at the crossroads of the imagination and the real, the voice.
And little by little, you have this shrinkage on the right, when you have to pass all this inner wealth into this tiny, the words.
Throughout my childhood, I thought, why we hadn't invented specific words to say all this wealth?
Why didn't we invent a specific word to talk about the joy you experience when you look at the sunlight in a leaf?
Why didn't we invent another different word to tell the joy you experience when you see your child, when you see your spouse?
It has nothing to do with it.
Probably because it was not considered useful and in fact, recent research on synesthesia would tend to show that we would all have, any child, these extra nerve connections, which explain synesthesia.
But we lose them little by little.
There is no inevitability of this, words are a framework, it has a convention that allows us to communicate, now, nothing prevents us from preserving the richness of our perception.
Yet we do not do it, we lock ourselves up in the context of words, we narrow our perception of the world to these words when there is nothing to do with us, probably because we think that is what others expect of us.
In antiquity, studies of ancient languages have shown that colors have been perceived in a very particular order: first black, white, red, green or yellow, and finally blue.
So this sea you see blue, the Greeks in antiquity saw it purple, for example.
Conversely, where you see snow, a Scotsman will be able to think of one of the 421 words used in his language to speak snow.
Inevitably, it has an impact on the way in which the world sees, from which it is, and it is probably this change of scenery, by the way we seek by going to the other side of the planet to discover new landscapes, certainly, but also new ways of seeing, of perceiving.
And very curiously, no one makes this journey that can be just as fascinating, which is just about asking your neighbor or neighbor, "Your perception of the world, your little inner voice, what do they tell you?" ”
If I make you travel through my synesthesia, you will enter a world where using the same word is the best guarantee of not understanding each other.
When I worked in financial diplomacy about 13 to 14 years ago, there was a very fashionable term, it was “healthy policy,” “sound policies,” which was used to refer to the policies that a country had to put in place to benefit from aid or debt reduction.
In the United Nations vision, “sound policies” was a global respect for human rights and not too much corruption.
For the IMF, this was a fiscal balance, point.
For the World Bank, this is the vision of the United Nations, that of the IMF, and then of other things, of investments in broad-based economic development, agriculture, urbanization, transport.
Now, these three international organizations, you put them at the same table, on the same text, using the same word, visually, you see right away that the misunderstandings are going to be many.
You may be able to grasp the beauty of diplomatic language of giving the illusion of a chord where it is not necessarily to be able to move forward, but you will also understand why there is then a whole need for a whole bureaucracy to deal with what happens next.
Entering my synesthesia is also about understanding an environment where thoughts and emotions appear at the same time as a satellite map and at the microscope level.
I've represented in this painting the vision that comes to me when I think, in a novel I'm writing, about the meeting between the main character, Arthur, and his friend Berenice, at a time when Berenice got hurt, the way they're going to fall in love and then lose their sight.
Behind this overall vision, you have a lot of more microscope visions that correspond to details of the chapter, to character elements of the characters.
For example, the painting on your left denotes and illustrates how Arthur sees Berenice's character.
A happy girl who is full of hope but also presents incomprehensible dark ideas.
If I vary the circumstances of their encounter, if they meet at the beach, if Arthur's character is different, if Berenice loses his dark ideas, immediately, the vision I'm going to have of the chapter will change, both at the satellite level and at the microscope level.
You're probably wondering what's the point of being a synesthete?
It's a difficult question as it's something you don't know, you're born with it.
But you can play it and have fun with it.
Personally, I think it is a great wealth to always be at the border between two cadres: the synaesthetic frame in which I think and the one of the words in which I am trying to communicate today.
Playing frames means, for example, not brainstorming at the level of words but at the level of perceptions and sensations that precede these words.
I'm willing to bet that the creators of Cleopatra glue, some of whom here may recall, think much more about the smell of almonds of this glue than its glue properties as such.
Playing frames is also not feeling constrained by how others are going to get your message.
So I wanted to write a poem and make a painting that illustrated the synesthesic vision that had given rise to this poem.
I told me about it to an editor who told me that he wasn't interested, that the important thing was the text, the painting, we totally didn't care.
I talked about it to a gallerist who had the opposite reaction: painting is the most important thing, the text is not enough.
And then, having spent a first moment of discouragement, I thought to myself that the most important thing was the message: what was the form, what was the mode of expression that was appropriate to this message?
So, if I try to make a poem to express the emotion that my synesthesia gives me on a daily basis, it might look like this: the demgged fire in the fury of sounds, noseted like a sun, the kernel of reality at the orphan constellations dazzles the interline thought of indistracted vertigo.
It's the poem that matches the painting that you have in front of you.
For me, the two are linked and inseparable.
Now, poetry lovers will be more sensitive to poems or not, painting lovers will be more sensitive to painting or not, but ultimately, whatever, because here the adventure of my perception stops and here starts yours.
(Applause)
Good morning.
You know what I do every day when I walk in Paris?
I can't help it.
I open the garbage cans and I look at what's in it.
At first, it was shame for my children.
Now, I'm very happy because they do as I do.
So, from the trash can, I get bottles, bottles, cans and lots of cartons every day.
These substances are recyclable materials.
They have nothing to do in this trash can.
Nothing at all.
And yet, they are there.
To sort, it takes three seconds.
One, two, three.
Three seconds.
It's not long, and yet, multiplied by 65 million people every day, it's huge for the environment.
Huge.
So these three seconds, when do we need them?
We need it when we've eaten lunch.
We need it when we've had dinner.
We need it when we get rid of it, we ask ourselves the question: do I throw away or do I sort?
Am I losing or do I win?
So what do we lose and what do we gain?
We all lose a lot when we don't sort.
Because these recyclable materials are wasted.
They will either be burned or buried in landfills.
And we're not going to tell each other a story: when they're in landfills, there's a little bit going to go into the forests, in the countryside and in the sea.
When we all sort, we win a lot.
Huge.
A can that is sorted, it will first be transported, sorted, collected, transformed, pampered, and it will again become a can or a bicycle, a car, a whole series of objects.
And it's the same for glass, it's the same for plastic, it's the same for plastic, bottles, and it's the same for cardboard.
All these substances, if placed in the right tray, can be reused.
We can all sort, sort, downstairs or next to home.
All.
And it takes three seconds.
This ability that we have to sort, this ability that we don't have to pollute, is simple.
And we owe it to two men.
Two men who, in the 1990s, changed their situation.
Remember at the time the landfills.
They were everywhere, it was overflowing and we couldn't manage the environmental impact of consumption.
And there, these two men decided to trust each other.
Instead of having the classic reflex to say, "Go and create a tax." ”
And then we're going to create an administration, there's going to be an administration that takes care of it.
And then we forget the subject.
These two men, Brice Lalonde, Minister of Ecology in 1992 and Antoine Riboud, Danone's boss, they decided to do otherwise.
While few people were talking about ecology in 1992, they say, "Here, we're going to start a private company, a non-profit company, but it will be private.
And it's going to be 100 percent in the public interest.
100% private, 100% dedicated to the general interest to focus on this subject.
So she's going to recruit and she's going to make sure she attracts other companies. ”
Another 50,000 consumer enterprises joined and worked with local authorities.
An incredible invention, and then the public, it was actually going to collect, sort and recycle.
The private company Eco-Emballs was going to be pilot of the device and the state would monitor and give the objectives.
At that point, it creates a dynamic.
Businesses, brands, associations, local authorities, municipalities, waste operators and recyclers, while they all have a radically different culture, unite and say, "Come on, let's go. ”
And the yellow tank sets in everywhere, or almost, and sorting begins.
Today, we are in an extremely efficient system.
In fact, the Eco-Packaging company works in a simple way.
A company that sells a packaged product, it will pay a lot if the packaging is heavy.
If the packaging is lightweight, eco-designed, it will pay less.
Afterwards, Eco-Emballs finance the set.
EUR 650 million is invested each year in sorting, collection and recycling.
So today, I'm also here to tell you that we're having difficulties.
In fact, in recent years, collection has not progressed.
It is stable.
And I have two pebbles in my shoe.
The first is the city.
In the city, half of the year is recycled less than in the countryside.
We're recycling in cities at only 30 percent.
It wants when in this room, there's only one in three sorters.
And bad news, in a few years, in less than a decade, we'll be 85 percent living in the city.
The second stone in the shoe I have is plastic.
In 1950, 1.5 million tons of plastic were produced.
Today, 350 million are produced.
In some time, 750 million tons of plastic will be produced.
And the problem is that plastic is only 23 percent recycled.
If you don't sort the plastic, it becomes that.
Plastic must be sorted because the seventh continent exists.
The seventh continent, it's in the sea, it's plastic particles that, little by little, run and create the world's largest landfill.
There's an alternative to that.
If we ever make this gesture, if we ever take this bottle, and everything else and put it in this tray and we use it, then what happens?
This is happening.
That's plastic that can make a bottle again.
It's plastic that's made without oil, it's plastic that makes all the things you can use every day, without touching on natural resources.
It's plastic that comes from the yellow tray.
It's plastic that comes from your sorting gesture.
And that's why today, I'm appealing for ideas, a call for projects.
Between you, with your friends, your associations, in the neighborhoods, let's try to find projects, ideas that revive the collection, that allow us to produce this, that allow us to turn plastic into resources.
And a resource has value.
A family that is not sorting today is like throwing 30 euros a year in the trash.
You will say to me, "That's a little, 30 euros here. ”
But if you take two hundred homes that do the same thing in a building, that's 6,000 dollars.
A city or district of 30,000 inhabitants, EUR 900 000 depart per year.
That's why I make this call for projects.
Organize, send us your proposals.
Together with local communities, solutions will be found to select and fund them.
Today I'd like to tell you that our only competitor is inaction, and that three seconds, three seconds to create a pollution barrier, it's simple and it's great.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening everyone.
I'm going to tell you my story.
I'm 17 years old, the baccalaureate in my pocket.
My father dreams of only one thing: that I prepare for the competitions of the great schools.
He himself is at the ESCP, where he teaches computer science, marketing.
And he said, "Go on, son, hold on."
Go beyond your limits. ”
I, in fact, think only of one thing, is above all to go beyond the limits of my neighborhood.
I am thinking only of one thing: to travel far, not only to France, but elsewhere.
So, I subscribed modestly to Nanterre University college in ethnology, then ethnomusicology.
Ah,
This is a good opportunity to travel.
I am working on the music of Benin, Northern Benin, a population called the Nyende.
Two months of travel, four months of travel...
But lo and behold, I can hardly finish my university course.
I'm just thinking about one thing: it's playing music.
I'm a drummer, percussionist.
I work in different music groups around the world.
I love all the music: biguine, jazz, African music, Balkan music, ra'a, and so on.
In 2004, I founded my own training called Hayduti Orkestar.
What is Haiti Orkestar?
It is the meeting of Balkan music, music from the East and Turkish music.
A whole program.
Does that tell you something?
Does it speak to you a little?
Not really.
So this band is made up of musicians of very different origins.
As Georges Moustaki would say: a real group of "metearchists".
There is a Greek on Rue de la Roquette that only aligns three words of Greek; a pure gypsy of Serbia, a Bulgarian, French - yes, French people like me, but scratching a little, never really French - a Spanishman but who claims to be Catalan pleases Barcelona.
You know this group, Haiti Orkestar?
No.
I hear "Yes," there's one person.
So much the better, here's an excerpt.
(Video: Hailduti Orkestar - "Ya Ayn Moulayiitain") (Sylvain on stage) It's a song in tribute to Syria, in the Arab Spring, at a time when we still have some hope.
Normally, in concert, people get up and start dancing.
You can... It's good, too.
(Hand-toning in rhythm) (End of video) (Applause) Thank you.
I discovered this music in the late '80s, it starts to date, especially through the films of Emir Kusturica "The Time of the Gypsies," "Underground."
I think everybody knows these movies.
Yes, anyway.
Me is the thunderbolt, an incredible click.
I'm passionate about this music.
I literally fall in love with these music and I'm deepening the question.
This is the beginning of a long immersion in these cultures.
In this journey, I'm going to meet people, musicians, because, for me, it's about going back to this background of Balkan music -- into the music of the gypsies, I don't know anybody -- meet Turkish music, look for all that.
That's it, it's done.
I'm going to take a portrait of three people who mattered a lot to me.
The first is Jasko Ramic.
Behind it is a woman in the snorkel.
She's the only woman in the group please.
I think a lot about her, her name is Charlotte.
Let's go back to Mr. Jasko Ramic.
She is a gypsy from Serbia.
It's a real accordion virtuoso, a real "size," as we say in jargon.
He has an empirical, theoretical knowledge of all these musics.
I meet him in a cellar in Paris.
It's a Bulgarian musician friend who introduces me to it.
In addition, he is a polyglot man.
He speaks Russian.
He speaks Romani, and Serbo-Croatian.
But lo and behold, I am coming, I speak French.
And I can't communicate with him.
Big problem, how do we exceed this limit?
In the end, we don't talk, we play.
Since then, we've been working together for more than a decade now.
He introduces me to this culture, this music, its energy, its nostalgia.
And I see that what I'm learning really contrasts with what I hear in the media.
In the media, what do I hear when we talk about gypsies?
I hear things not very beautiful.
It's about a slum, it's about kidnapped children.
And I'm really living something else.
I travel to Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece.
I feel safe there.
I've met generous people who give me their music literally.
That's it.
I advise you to go and see the work of The Voice of the Roma, which is an association that deals with a little of this whole Roma problem and gives a positive image.
A second person who has meant a lot to me, he's a trumpeter.
He is Lebanese, but in fact mostly French since he grew a few kilometers away from here, in the south of the department.
This boy has incredible energy.
I meet him, he's 25 years old.
So, it's been a good ten years.
He is Lebanese and his parents fled Lebanon.
That's important.
That boy, today, is very well known.
His name is Mr. Ibrahim Maalouf.
I think you know him.
This boy takes us to the Olympia.
Recently, we wrote the music for the film "The Cow" by Mohamed Hamidi, with Djamel Wilson... Djamel Debbouze, Lambert Wilson.
(Laughter) (Video: "The Great Journey") (Sylvain on stage) That's the meeting of cultures.
Here's an excerpt.
(Video: Ibrahim Maalouf and Haiti Orkestar - "The Great Journey") (Sylvain on stage) That's the instrument I'm playing, among other things.
I'm a drummer and I play drumming.
(End of video) (Applause) A third person who has been a big one in my career, my journey is Mr. 'Eki', this man is from Antioch, Turkey.
It's 80 kilometers from Syria.
He fled Turkey at the age of 30 for political reasons, sailing under his arm.
He passed through Syria, transited and stayed in Germany, and ended up in France, in Bobigny.
So this man, I meet him in a restaurant in Paris, a good 15 years ago. I don't know if it was a Kurdish restaurant or a Turkish restaurant.
At the time, for me, it's a little bit the same.
But no, in fact, it's very, very different.
With that man, we're going to walk.
He's going to show me the little Istanbul.
Do you know little Istanbul?
The district of Little Istanbul is the Turkish quarter in Paris between Château d'Eau and Strasbourg Saint-Denis.
This is where culture and and this whole community come together.
So, we're walking in the streets.
We're going to meet his friends at the bookstore of Ozgul.
We go to listen to the latest developments in Tuana Music, the only Turkish music store in Paris.
All the new features, the records, the musical instruments, we find everything concerning Turkey.
Very quickly, we want to share things, to make known this Turkish music that we do not know, which is really unknown in France.
And, we also decide to go even further and open up to other cultures.
There, I had another card earlier.
It's not the same thing.
In any case, we are also interested in Armenia, Azerbaijan.
We're trying to cross our boundaries, to cross borders.
You will notice a little of this whole region, today, it is a real powder keg, between the problem of migrants, the Kurdish problem, Erdogan today who is becoming a real dictator - as can be made clear.
These, at that time, there are associations that are taking up agreements with us, associations that have values that are somewhat similar to ours, which are for sharing.
I'm thinking about Cimade, Value Added.
I meet the Cimade in Massy, not far from here.
Every year, they do a party where we eat a lot of things, different dishes from all countries.
That was another moment of sharing.
I am also thinking of the BAAM, the Accom3 and Accompanying Office of Migrants.
Last September, we did a concert.
The same was a great moment of emotion and sharing.
Somalis, Eritreans, Turks, French people, everyone together has gathered together to communicate around our music.
It was a great moment.
So, more recently, I wanted to go beyond gender, so I went to meet jazz.
(Video: Haiti's Orkestar and Bojan-Tchagri) (Sylvain on stage) He is a Bosnian pianist.
I wanted, with this talk, to show you how much music and my encounters had opened up to me about the world, and that miscegenation is a way of opening up to the world.
That's it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It is early morning.
You look in the mirror.
What do you say?
Not very long ago, I used to say, "Hey.
Hello, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, ”
(Laughter) Unfortunately, I was surprised to say, "Oh, hey... "It looks like my grandfather. ”
Maybe you like what you see in the mirror.
Or maybe not...
In any case, you recognize this image as your own.
How do you recognize yourself?
What is your identity?
This topic is crucial, because the way we define ourselves affects the way we relate to others.
I used to think I had a very strong identity.
I was a Mexican ready to conquer the rest of the world.
So I started by moving to Paris.
Eleven years ago.
And everything was in line with my plans, until last year.
Indeed, three events led me to ask, "Who is this person I call me?" ”
"Good morning.
Do we know each other? ”
The first event, I call it "Meeting with the Ancestors."
One day, when I was surfing the Internet, I read an article that said, "If your last name is on this list, then you may be a descendant of one of the Jewish families of Sefarial who are evicted from Spain in the 15th century. ”
And maybe soon you can apply for Spanish nationality.
I looked at the list.
To my surprise, my father's surname, Meza, was there.
As a Mexican, I expected to have some Spanish blood in my veins.
But I never imagined that... Does that mean there's a little bit of Jewish blood flowing in my Mexican veins?
Is that why I loved the film "A Violin on the Roof" so much?
Or even, more importantly: do I now have the right to put guacamole in my falafel?
(Laughter) It may be crazy, but since I've read this article, I feel closer to my Jewish side.
The second event: "Elementary Course of Cellular Identity" here I am in conversation with my friend, Julien, a French biologist in his state.
He explains to me, "Antonio, from a biology perspective, I can tell you that this question about your identity doesn't make sense.
I'll explain to you: your cells are reproducing and dying, okay?
And your body needs seven years for complete regeneration.
So you can say that, after seven years, you're a completely different person from the one you used to be. ”
"Wait, I say."
You know I've lived in France for eleven years.
And you're telling me that all this time, my body's cells have been regenerating with proteins coming directly from camembert.
Cash-out.
What about duck cans?
(Laughter) Does that mean, from a biology perspective, I'm already French? ”
(Laughter) It may be crazy, but since this conversation with Julien, I feel closer to my French side.
And finally.
The third event: "The Ring on the Finger" And yes, last year I got married.
Thank you, thank you.
(Applause) And my lovely wife is German.
(Laughter) Finally, his mother is German and his father is Hungarian.
So it's half German and half Hungarian.
It may be crazy, but since I got married, I've been feeling much closer to my new German and Hungarian sides.
It's like a whole new family.
But, can you imagine the day we have a child?
How do you explain it to him?
"My son, my daughter, your Mexican origins mean that you have Spanish and Aztec strains.
But also Jewish roots.
Besides, you have a German trunk and Hungarian branches.
And you pushed on a French soil.
That makes you a very exotic plant. ”
(Laughter) I think my kids will need at least four passports.
And good therapy.
As a result of all these events, I was completely lost.
Who is my people?
Do I have to give up who I am, before I kiss the one I become?
Who is this person I call "me"?
At the end of the day, it was me who needed good therapy.
But a few weeks later, I was taking a personal development course offered by my friend Robert of California.
At some point during the seminar, Robert proposed this exercise to us: You are face to face with another person, and looking at that person, you say, "I see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know you're much more than that. ”
When Robert explained this exercise, I really thought it was California hippie madness.
(Laughter) But when my partner in the exercise told me these words... (Long inspiration) Maybe it's crazy, but I felt much closer to myself.
Eventually, I didn't need to know in my head who I was, I could just recognize myself in the other's gaze.
And his eyes became the mirror where I could recognize myself, I saw my origins, and my potential.
I could kiss the whole thing.
I could be much more than I imagined... And that's fine.
It's early morning, you look in the mirror.
What do you say?
You're much more than the color of your skin, much more than the borders of your countries and much more than your genetic heritage.
So tomorrow morning, when you're going to see yourself in the mirror, try to think this, "Hello.
I see you.
And I can see your strength.
And I can see your fragility.
And I know you're a lot more, much more than all that. ”
Thank you.
(Applause)
Can you imagine patients waiting weeks before they can be treated?
Last year, a hospital called me to coach a service that was about to close.
It was going to put some of the organization of the hospital at risk.
Doctors resigned one after the other, with administrative and health-care staff being completely dismotivated.
And after analysis, it turned out that all of this was related to the leadership style of the head of department, which we'll call Dr. X.
This doctor X is a very authoritarian, very controlling and very uncommunicating person.
And yet, it is a world leader in its field of expertise.
You, as well as patients, want to be treated by these half-gods on Earth, but if he is not able to keep his team, there's a good chance that his expertise will disappear with him, and he can't treat as many patients as he does today.
Being an excellent doctor doesn't make him an excellent manager.
And that, the headhunters understood this.
I am Marie-Bernard Guillaume, and I will explain to you tonight why, from head-hunting, I became a hearth hunter.
Most of the entrepreneurs I meet share the same concern: how do you motivate your staff?
According to Gallup studies, only one in ten collaborators is really happy at work, passionate.
Seven out of ten come to do their job, but they should not be asked more.
Two out of ten are even active saboteurs: they come with their ill-being and they prevent others from working properly.
Imagine the disaster that would be if we applied this ratio to our national football team, to our Red Devils.
There, you start to get hurt, you understand the problem of managers.
What makes an employee motivated?
Do you all know the Maslow pyramid?
Forget her.
(Laughter) Other studies have shown that we all share three needs, three motivational factors, which are universal, whether you're male or female, whether you're young or old.
Regardless of philosophical or religious beliefs, we share these factors and needs.
The first need is the need for personal development.
It's being able to use my abilities to realize my dreams, to achieve goals: "Wow, what am I good about.
I succeeded.
I'm proud of myself. ”
The second need is the need for autonomy.
It's being able to do what I want, whenever I want, and how I want.
The third need is the need for connectivity.
It's being able to feel a way that belongs and in connection with a community, with a team, with a family.
It's being supported, being liked on Facebook.
And so, as you will have understood, the company that is able to respond to these three factors is likely to see the engagement rate of its employees much higher than elsewhere.
Now, most of the managers still work, like our doctor X, with a hierarchical pyramid that is well defined, with roles and functions that frame the roles of everyone, which has the effect of slackening, killing all the need for autonomy and any initiative.
Fortunately, fortunately, more and more companies have understood this problem and are building cultures of participatory, collaborative leadership.
In these companies, the well-being of the employee takes precedence, results, success and financial results are the consequences.
And not the other way around.
The hierarchical pyramid is also reversed to replace managers with teams that make decisions together, collectively.
We are not in the Bisounours, there are results to be achieved, there are objectives, but above all there is a vision and values that are shared by all.
We're driving his work.
I could cite several examples of success.
I'm going to talk about a company that you certainly know, given the average age here: it's Netflix, a Silicon Valley company.
They decided to build an HR culture in which responsibility and freedom will be promoted.
Imagine: you're free to organize your job as you see fit, and wherever you want; you don't check your expense bills; you're not going to check the number of days you take of; you're just asked to do the best you can for the sake of the company.
Isn't that a nice answer to the need for autonomy?
You are being asked to take initiatives and we accept that you are wrong, because one is not going without the other.
This has the effect of creating a movement of innovation and intrapreneurship within the company.
I could cite other examples of success, but let's focus on the actors in these changes: who are they?
It is, of course, business leaders and managers, but it is also each and every one of you, each of the employees, every one of the employees.
And to plagiate Gandhi, I would say, "Be the change you want to see in your company." ”
And to do that, it requires beautiful human qualities, it requires developed emotional intelligence.
And by that I mean qualities like empathy, benevolence, listening, tolerance.
How do we develop this emotional intelligence?
You'll say, "Some are more gifted than others." ”
And the good news of tonight is that you all have these qualities.
They are part of your human nature.
They are parasitized on a daily basis by the various stresses that surround us.
It can be physical stress -- I challenge you to be kind to a dentist who pulls a tooth out of your heart -- emotional or mental.
And so you just have to drop that stress to rediscover all these qualities and be able to deploy them around you.
Easy to say, but how do we do it?
And that's where I would draw a parallel with the emergence in our society of mindfulness and meditation.
It is no coincidence that we see these tools emerging in hospitals, in schools, in companies, and even at the last world summit of the economy in Davos, where each participant was offered a meditation session before starting the day.
I could showcase all the studies that demonstrate the correlation and the positive impact of mindfulness on creativity and emotional intelligence.
I'm going to propose to you tonight to experience a break of full awareness together.
I ask you to accept this exercise with this open mind that has brought you here today, without prejudice.
It's a tool that you can use at any time of the day, on the train, in a queue, in a company before a meeting, and even during a TED talk.
Are you ready?
So, let's go.
I suggest you close your eyes, sit comfortably in your seat, feel the weight of your body on the seat, the feet on the floor, the weight of the clothes on the skin.
You feel the breath of the air on your face and hands.
Just look at your breathing.
Let go of all the tensions, all the ideas, all the judgments.
Breathe.
Now turn your attention to the nearest sounds.
Broaden your listening to the most distant sounds.
Rest, just, a few moments, here and now.
Breathe deeply, open your eyes, reconnect with the outside world, in this room, with your neighbors.
The world is changing.
Yesterday, in an industrial economy, headhunters were asked to recruit labour.
Today, in a knowledge-based economy, he is being asked to recruit brains, diplomas.
I am convinced that artificial intelligence will give us access to levels of knowledge tomorrow, as we have never before.
I'm convinced that artificial intelligence is going to make a diagnosis of the patient that is going to be more relevant than that of our doctor X.
And what we'll expect from our doctor X is his human qualities.
Because it's the human that's going to inspire others, it's the human who's going to bring new ideas, it's the human who will make the organizations and the companies of tomorrow succeed.
And so we arrive in a humanist economy where the interpersonal qualities of creativity and heart will be the criteria for selecting headhunters.
I can therefore only encourage all of you to cultivate and unfold these beautiful qualities that you possess to practice without moderation mindfulness or any other tool that will allow you to reconnect with your own humanity, to your own infinity.
Thank you and good work.
(Applause)
Beyond our solar system, there are planets that gravitate around other stars.
They're called exoplanets.
Exoplanets, because they're outside the solar system.
As you can imagine, it's really hard to detect them because they're very far from us.
And yet, regularly, astronomers tell us that they have discovered new exoplanets.
There is even a recent study, which suggests that of all the exoplanets that need to exist in our galaxy, there could be 20 billion, likely to have liquid water on their surface, and thus offer a potentially life-attainment environment.
Do you realize?
EUR 20 billion
Well, if we want to study the criteria for the habitability of a planet, we're going to look at four criteria that have to be met for this study to be successful.
The first criterion is that the planet is at the right distance from the star.
In fact, the image you have on the screen is an exoplanet drawing.
Because they're way too far away, you can't see this level of detail.
But what the artist wanted to represent was a planet in the habitability zone of the star.
That is to say, at the surface of which the temperature would be the right one so that the water can remain in the liquid state for a fairly long time.
Closer to us, in the solar system, there are also planets that can tell us about habitability.
So of course, today, to our knowledge, there is only one that is habitable and inhabited, it is the Earth, since we are there, and the other candidates are rare.
Mars, which depending on the model is or is not in the habitability zone, and then satellites, giant planets, like Europe around Jupiter, and Enceladu, around Saturn.
Here, it is the tidal forces that compensate for the lack of solar energy.
I'm going to talk to you about Mars, and the Curiosity mission, which recently established that one day this planet has met the criteria of habitability.
Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012.
The animation that you see shows you the entry into the atmosphere, the descent and the landing, which actually last seven minutes.
Seven minutes of terror, where the choreography must be performed perfectly, with very little margin for error.
Everything is pre-programmed.
First a heat shield, then a parachute is used to brake, then back-fro, then a crane system, to place this 900 kg machine, with precision and softness on the surface of Mars.
The accuracy of the landing is a few kilometers, while we have just traveled hundreds of millions of kilometers between Earth and Mars, for nine months.
Unbelievable, right?
Curiosity is a NASA mission, led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the University of Caltech in California, with several international collaborations.
It took five years to build it.
And Curiosity sends us back every day new images of Mars.
From now on, I'm going to show you some real pictures.
Like this one.
So of course, to the eyes of the neophyte, all the images of Mars are similar.
Now, what do we see, what do you see?
You see stones, you see sand.
Anyway, Mars is a desert.
A very dry desert, even if you compare it to the deserts of land.
But then, isn't there a contradiction with what I just told you?
That Mars was an interesting planet for studying habitability.
That the planet is at the right distance from the sun to have liquid water.
You see some liquid water, you?
It's a matter of atmosphere.
Today the atmosphere of Mars is so tenuous, that you can't have liquid water on its surface.
There is plenty of ice in the basement, near the poles, we might find liquid water at great depth, but on the surface, today we have a desert.
At the same time, I'm sure you've already heard in the news, researchers who announced that there had been evidence that there had been liquid water on the surface of Mars.
And indeed, in the past, there has been.
So, my second criterion of habitability, after distance, is going to be time, the geological era.
You have to be in the right times, to have the right atmosphere, which allows you to have liquid water on the surface of the planet.
Let me explain.
When the planets form, initially, they are extremely hot.
As the drawing suggests on your left.
In the case of the solar system, that was 4.6 billion years ago.
Then you can imagine the planets, as thermal machines that cool down in their history.
So at some point, for some of them, the temperature may be adequate, and the atmosphere may be adequate, to have liquid water on its surface.
This was the case, for the Earth and for Mars, just over 4 billion years ago.
That's what we see in the middle drawing.
And we've accumulated, with space exploration, a lot of evidence, that there has indeed been water on Mars.
So of course, at the beginning of space exploration in the '60s, we killed the myth of the Martian, revealing a desert planet.
But very soon after, in the '70s, the images that came back from Mars showed canyons that looked like dried-up river beds.
And even more recently, the various missions have shown us that the minerals that form the rocks, some of these minerals, are formed in the presence of water.
So we're convinced that, in the distant past, Mars had liquid water on its surface.
And then the planet continued to evolve, with a lot of volcanism, its history diverged from that of the Earth, because it's smaller, eventually ending up with this picture that you have on your right, which shows a planet with extinct giant volcanoes, huge canyons, and large desert expanses.
So why are we interested in this planet?
Well, precisely because, at some point in its history, there was water on the surface of Mars at the same time as there was water on the surface of the Earth.
And at that time, three or four billion years ago, life appeared on Earth.
We know very little about this part of our history, but we must ask ourselves questions.
Is this a unique phenomenon on Earth?
What should be the conditions for this to happen elsewhere?
And that's why when you study habitability on another planet, you have to study the right times, the time when there was liquid water in its evolution, in its history.
Curiosity, like the other missions, has provided us with evidence that there has been liquid water at its landing site.
And I have to confess, the first time I saw this picture, I was working in California, we were on Martian time.
It's a bit of a weird experience.
The first time I saw this picture, I thought it was a gag.
It could very well have been a sidewalk after an earthquake, something like that.
But in reality, the whole team was amazed, by this image that came from Mars, and showed us a conglomerate.
That is, a rock that is formed of rock fragments that were transported there, and cemented together.
And what's remarkable about the geologist's eye is that these rock fragments are rounded.
A little bit like pebbles if you like, little pebbles that we'd find at the bottom of a river.
And geologists are even able, with the shape of these rocks, to calculate the amount of water that went through there, and tell you that there was a river with a depth a little less than a meter.
So, of course, we didn't choose the landing site by chance.
But, this image was vividly revealing, which we had landed in what is one day, was the delta of a river, flowing there, several billion years ago.
Here, I'm showing you this other image, another rock photographed by Curiosity a little bit further.
This flat rock has also formed in the presence of water.
In fact, there were already some on the first picture I showed you, the one where we talked about desert.
It is a sedimentary rock, that is to say it is formed of very small fragments that have been transported by wind or rivers, and in this case have deposited at the bottom of a lake to form this rock.
And then the water continued to flow through the fractures of the rock, as evidenced by the small clear vein in the middle of the rock.
And Curiosity is able to measure the composition of these rocks, with several instruments.
For example, ChemCam, the instrument I'm working with, uses a laser that's going to pull on the rock, it's going to make a little spark, and to just do, the color of the spark tells us the chemical elements that are in the rock.
And so, I can tell you that the composition of the vein is different from the composition of the rock, and that this vein is rich in sulfur.
It's an interesting element if I'm interested in life.
There are others, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus.
In fact, the composition of the rocks will allow us to know under what conditions it has formed.
And beyond that, what was the environment of this region on Mars, when this rock formed.
What was the temperature?
Was the water acidic?
Was the atmosphere oxidizing?
What were the chemical elements present?
Were there those who were useful to life?
To answer all these questions, I'm going to have to use all the instruments of Curiosity, because it forms my third criterion of habitability.
It's not enough to be at the right distance from the star and to be in the right time to have liquid water, I also have to have the chemical environment that is welcoming, let's say, for life.
And if possible, it lasts long enough, because it's going to take time for life to evolve.
So here's Curiosity in his lake, dried up for some time.
This region was called Yellowknife Bay.
It's a real picture, a selfie, one more.
Curiosity is a little more than two meters wide, it is a little bigger than me, it is equipped with a dozen instruments, including two French-American instruments, ChemCam and Sam, which both measure the composition of the rocks.
ChemCam, this is this laser that I told you about, you see its telescope at the top of the mast.
It's going to set up a kind of chemical panorama around the robot.
And Sam, on the other hand, is going to be able to do a very fine measure of the composition, when you take rock.
Well, since the landing, hundreds of researchers and engineers have been taking a daily turn to operate, to make Curiosity work on the surface of Mars.
At the end of its day, the robot sends all these observations back to Earth via a relay satellite.
The international team is taking up this issue, and decides what to do the next day, the business plan.
Are we going to do a new measure?
Are we going to move the robot?
The on-board computer is then programmed, which will execute this program automatically the next day.
And so on.
This is a rather great and quite successful example of collaborative work, and I have the good fortune with a few colleagues, and with the help of the CNES, to participate here in Toulouse.
Curiosity is also equipped with a small drill, a little drill, I'm going to zoom in on this picture, you can see the hole that has been dug into the rock, which turns out to be a clay, so a rock that has formed in the presence of water too, and we notice that the powder of this rock has a different color, it's grayish, it's different from the color of the Martian surface.
You can also see the marks that the laser left when sampling this rock powder.
Well, by bringing together all the results, of all these instruments, and the knowledge of all these researchers involved in this project, we came to the conclusion, that this region of Mars, when these rocks formed, several billion years ago, were meeting the conditions of habitability.
Namely, that we had one or more episodes with water, maybe for a few tens of thousands of years, that this water was fresh, pH neutral, low salinity, and that we had the chemical elements, which could have been useful for a microscopic life if it had been there.
In the latter question, it is not clear how to answer.
Hayability does not mean inhabited.
So we don't know, we don't have the elements to say whether there was life or not.
But we have the evidence that the environment was favourable, was compatible.
So admit, after all, that Mars appears to us a little less desert.
It's great, isn't it?
Let's take a little pitch with this picture.
It's a picture that's taken by a satellite that orbits Mars, from a region that's a little bit further south than the one I just showed you, called the Kimberley.
And Curiosity stopped, and here, you can see it in the picture, he's here.
And maybe you also see the traces that his wheels left in the sand to get into this corner.
And so we continue our mission of geologists, to try to understand how Mars works.
And we also continue to question habitability.
Besides, I announced to you a fourth criterion, which is useful, interesting, when we want to study habitability.
And also, we might ask ourselves, why did we stop there to do a new drilling, and why not elsewhere?
Well, as you will have understood, the information we are looking for is recorded in the rock.
So it's a solid record, but on the time scales that we consider, this information may very well disappear.
And that's what's happening on Earth, which is a geologically very dynamic planet.
So, I have this information in my rock, and I need to protect it.
And usually, it happens by covering this interesting layer of rock with another layer of rock or sand.
But then, after I rediscover this information, when I do my exploration.
And so, or you're able to dig deep enough, you kind of do archaeology.
Or, you let erosion do.
And that's what's happening here.
The wind has blewn for millions of years, and uncovered rock mounds in the basement that are five meters high, the three mounds that you can see, so which are rocks that formed billions of years ago, and so let us know about how Mars was at that time.
So here, to conclude, while you're looking at this panorama that shows us the richness of the site explored by Curiosity, I just wanted to make you touch the quest for habitability.
Being at the right distance from the star, being in the right epoch, having the right environment, and having preserved the information.
If you wanted to be interested in life, you will also have to give time, when you have the right conditions, to this life to evolve.
We are not there yet today, but a whole picture of research continues to develop, to ask these questions, it is exobiology.
I would like you to realise, on the one hand, the multitude of options offered to us by all these planets.
And on the other hand, the beauty of the Earth that is habitable.
Everything that is accessible to us by the mind, and the finiteness of the cosmos accessible to humanity.
So you'll tell me, "What's the point?" ”
Well, yes, I'm very often asked this question, what's the point?
And I say, "Nothing. ”
Yes, because if the question is whether it's going to bring money, and change my daily life, right now, no.
However, remember the lesson Raymond Devos bequeathed to us.
"Nothing is nothing." ”
He had demonstrated that you could get something with nothing by multiplying it.
He said, "Once nothing is nothing."
Twice nothing is not much.
But three times nothing...
You can already get something with three times nothing.
Isn't that? ”
Well, the research is exactly that.
Basic research is accumulating these little things that make our acquaintances, shared knowledge.
So of course, when we turn into a project like this, we also improve our technology, but above all, we exercise our ability to think, which is our asset.
We mobilize our knowledge to understand complex phenomena.
So, ladies and gentlemen, please continue to be intoxicated with curiosity.
(Applause)
Good evening.
I'm going to do my entry again, actually.
(Laughter) Good evening to you.
(Applause) Good evening, so my subject is: Take advantage of vice.
The subject looks a little pompous, so I'm going to start with a very down earth thing: a picture of my grandmother, Monique alias Mamou, actually.
My story begins two years ago, when Monique gave me a book on social entrepreneurship, a book by Muhammad Yunus.
Like many, I loved this book for two things: one, social entrepreneurship, is great to do business not to maximize profits, but to solve social problems, and secondly, I kissed my race, the fact that, precisely, you can see the positive in everything they did.
That's what he does, Muhammad, he sees the positive in all the stuff he describes, even capitalism.
As a result, it led me to try to think about ideas to answer issues caused by capitalism.
Today the economic system in which we are, it works, it is perfect like Jessica Alba, no it's a joke.
Try to laugh at the jokes.
There are some flaws, some problems, of the left behind in the system.
Growing inequalities, environmental problems, pollution, mass unemployment, etc.
Besides that, there are also excessive things.
For example, there are budgets that are excessive.
Notably one, which to me was really in excess, it was advertising.
I'll give you two seconds to read this sentence.
One, two.
What's great about this sentence is that she's in the movie 99 Francs and she really contrasts two parts of capitalism.
On the one hand, what is in excess, that is to say, advertising budgets, which are colossal.
Advertising itself is not negative.
It creates desire, promotes a product.
It's not unhealthy in itself.
It is, after all, an excessive budget.
The other part of the sentence really shows the flaws of capitalism, which it can't fill.
North-South inequality, for example.
In the end, we realize that, with this phenomenal budget, less than half would eliminate hunger in the world.
This shows a real gap between the two.
I thought, why don't I see them in opposition anymore, but try to connect them?
Create a tool that makes it possible, like Robin des bois, to create a link that diverts part of the advertising budget, excessive, to fill one of these gaps.
I started thinking, and so on.
I ended up having an idea.
She arrived at a somewhat unexpected moment, in fact in the shower.
There are two places to think, in the shower and to the toilet.
I was kind of in the shower.
I came up with this idea, I was really happy.
Today this idea has turned into a start-up called Goodeed.
We're raising money today, we're four people.
Thank you.
(Applause) Tristan and Thomas are in the room.
Thomas couldn't come because of car problems.
Tristan is Goodeed's web designer, he's in the room.
This really cool idea, what is it?
It is a website for free donations.
You go to this site, you choose a donation, a vaccine, a tree or a meal.
Then you look at a pub spot.
The money that the ad generates finances its donation.
It's a free donation for the Internet user.
That's the first side.
The second, not for the user, but for the advertiser, the one I want to go deeper tonight, is to show that what is in excess in capitalism, a budget seen as excessive, as something negative in the end, is now re-humanized.
We gave a new meaning to the pub.
Advertising budgets have been allowed to regain meaning, a useful one.
Today Goodeed financed with WFP in Kenya, meals of 18,000 children for a month.
And that, just because of your donations, there were more than 500,000, and thanks to the ad.
Finally, what can be seen as negative, can also be positive.
We just need to create a tool, try to innovate to turn it into something positive.
And that's the Chinese have been doing it for millennia.
It's in their vocabulary.
Crisis in Chinese is called "Weiji".
"Wei," which is the danger.
The first symbol is a man who threatens someone else with a knife.
It doesn't look like that, but that's it.
The second symbol is opportunity, opportunity.
It's "Ji."
It shows that in the most critical situations, we can bounce back.
We see the positive in the negative.
Thanks to a situation that destabilizes us, we're going to be stimulated, to see other things, differently, in a young way.
I came to tell you that tonight: try to see things frozen, like advertising, it's necessarily an excessive, negative budget, there are flaws in capitalism.
They can be seen differently and try to create links by innovating.
So, create companies that have this social aspect in their DNA.
Good evening, thank you very much.
(Applause)
According to the World Health Organization, there is a shortfall of 100 million litres of blood worldwide to meet the needs of the world's population.
In addition, the Etablissement Français du Sang tells us that 90% of French people know that the donation of blood can save lives.
And despite this figure, only 4% of them are making this gesture every year.
And this scenario is happening again in most industrialized countries.
In the face of this gap between human blood donations and the needs of the world's population, we must find an alternative to this practice, in order to respond to this real public health problem.
And, as amazing as it may seem, I may have found one of the solutions.
And the solution, I found it on a beach in Brittany.
Already very young, I was fascinated by the oceans, and I think Commander Cousteau's emissions were not foreign.
So I naturally decided to make it my job, and I became a PhD in marine biology.
An environment caught my attention very early, because that environment was colonized by very old organisms.
This environment is the foreshore, or a scientific name for an environment that you have to appreciate since in fact it is the beach.
And the beach in Brittany is covered twice a day by the tide.
And the sand of this beach is home to very old organisms that you've certainly seen, by the traces that these organisms leave on the sand, by depositing your towel.
In fact, these traces testify to the presence of a marine organism called the avenicol.
So the arenicole is the name of a well-known marine worm on the beaches in Brittany whose name in Breton is Buzuc.
So I looked at this marine worm to answer questions about respiratory ecophysiology.
So what does that mean?
Oh, it's simple, I was interested in the breathing of this sea worm.
I was actually trying to understand, how this worm was breathing between high tide and low tide.
And in order to answer this basic research question, (Laughter) I became interested in the blood of this animal.
Indeed, blood is an extremely interesting biological fluid.
It interfaces between the physiology of an organism and its environment.
In fact, blood is made up of different cells, but the molecule that carries oxygen, the oxygen that's essential to all living organisms, which is a little bit -- if I took an example related to mechanics -- oxygen, that's a little bit the fuel that you're going to put in your vehicle.
Without fuel, it's the dry failure.
And without oxygen, it's death assured.
In fact, blood contains a type of cell called red blood cells.
Red blood cells are a small vehicle that will deliver the gas to your body's cells.
And to be more precise, this molecule contains a protein called hemoglobin.
Haemoglobin is a molecule that is capable of reversibly binding oxygen.
And what was my surprise, to discover that the blood of this sea worm present here had no red blood cells.
Oh, I have to be honest, when I started my discovery, I didn't know the scale of this work.
But [they's discovery went up to the ears of a learned club, called the Red Globule Club.
(Laughter) So I was invited to Paris, to a Parisian hospital to present my research in front of a parterre of doctors, hematologists.
And at the end of my scientific talk, several of them went down the amphi and asked me the following questions, "But, sir, you didn't find this molecule that has this structure, who has this function?" ”
"Well, yes. ”
"But we've been looking for this molecule for more than 40 years to make it a universal blood substitute. ”
You and I have a blood group ABO, Rhesus positive or rhesus negative.
Only the O-negative is of the universal donor type.
The absence of red blood cells in this animal gave this molecule a universal character.
And back to the lab, in order to test this hypothesis, I rushed to go to the beach collect a few hundred aricols, just to try to collect the hemoglobin contained in their circulatory system, and after purifying this molecule by conventional laboratory techniques, I rushed to go and transfuse rodents.
And what was not my surprise, after exsanguination of these more than 80 percent laboratory animals, I transfused this molecule from these animals, and nothing happened.
(Laughter) The organisms, these rodents, lived with hemoglobin of sea worm.
An astonishing discovery, and today a huge hope for medicine.
A nose to all those skeptics who asked me the question, "But what's the point of studying the breathing of a sea worm?"
(Laughter) You really don't have any other things to do in a CNRS lab? ”
(Laughter) In order to accompany this research, I'm forced to leave the CNRS to create a biotechnology company that will be responsible for developing these molecules towards medical applications.
And it only takes a few hundred grams of aricol to make a bloody pocket.
The applications of this molecule are numerous.
Why?
Well, just because oxygen is at the center of all biological and physiological processes, so, ultimately, life.
In the first years of the creation of this society, I spent them developing an industrial process of producing my sailing worms.
Indeed, being a biologist, it was out of the question for me to go and discard all the beaches in Brittany.
And today, these worms are produced in aquaculture, in a fully controlled and traced environment.
Several hundred tonnes of this animal are produced in aquaculture.
Apart from the worm, the raw material, the biomass, it was also necessary to find a system for the industrial production of the extraction of these molecules under pharmaceutical conditions.
And today, we actually have a whole process that can extract molecules from biomass.
From this industrial and marine worm production process, there are an extremely large number of applications.
And I'm going to quote three of them, but there's a lot of them.
First, it's blood transfusion.
You know, when you donate your blood, a blood bag can be stored for 42 days, because the red blood cells are perishable.
In addition, it is necessary to maintain the cold chain at 4 C.
I would remind you that this molecule is not contained in a red blood cell.
And it is thus possible to obtain freeze-dried blood, that is to say powdered blood, which can be dissolved by pharmaceutical water.
So no more storage problems.
No more conservation problems at 4oC.
This product could be quickly available on emergency areas, on cataclysm areas, where patients are really needed to transfuse patients.
This product is now under development thanks to a partnership with the US military.
The second application is healing.
So not any kind of wound.
Wounds that are going to be found in people who suffer from diabetes, so-called diabetic foot syndrome, people who suffer from beds, the big burns, all these wounds have the characteristic of poorly healing.
Why?
Well, just because the blood flow hurts.
And unfortunately, the wounds that we're going to find in people with diabetes usually end badly, since most of these people are amputated.
And this affects 20 million people around the world.
We were able to show that dressings impregnated with this molecule were capable of delivering oxygen at the feet, so at the level of these wounds, and therefore, in the end, of avoiding amputation.
The third of these applications, which is now the most advanced since a human trial will take place at the end of the year, is organ transplantation.
In France, 500 people die a year due to lack of grafts on a waiting list of 19,000 patients.
Why?
Because, in fact, the solutions that are currently used in the clinic are composed only of water and salt but of no oxygen transporter.
When a donor is taken from an organ, it is immediately disconnected from the bloodstream.
And we were able to show that by using this molecule, it was possible to dramatically increase the storage time of a graft.
One heart today is four hours, between the collection in the donor and the moment when we're going to transplant it to the recipient.
One kidney is 12 o'clock.
With this molecule, today, it has been possible to double the storage time of these organs and to multiply by four the storage time of a kidney.
So today, we're able to increase the pool of grafts available for transplantation.
Research is progressing, but it is not progressing as fast as we would like.
Why?
Because the drug cycle is long, very long, very, very long, and waiting for our product to be put on the market, which could save millions of lives around the world, I can only get you to give your blood.
Be generous in saving lives.
And a little piece of advice among friends, go ahead, because tomorrow, it could be a gesture of another time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm coming back from Agadez, to Niger.
Agadez, perhaps some know, it was the pearl of the Sahara, the gateway to the desert, the blessed stage of the Paris-Dakar.
Today, there is more tourist since the 2010 abductions.
On the other hand, there are migrants, hundreds and hundreds of migrants from West Africa.
The mayor told me: in the migration season, the population of the city triples.
In two weeks when it's less hot.
39 instead of 45.
For those who cross the Sahara in the back of the pickups to Libya, it matters.
So you're going to tell me: not yet stories of migrants, we only hear that.
And if I were to say that we're actually not talking about it at all.
We only talk about refugees.
The ones you're shown on TV are Syrians, Iraqis.
They are fleeing a war.
We were well told that they are doctors, lawyers, that at home they have a large house, a housekeeper.
They're a bit like us, they're white.
I cover Africa for the magazine Le Point.
And the ones I've started to follow since June are the ones we don't want at home.
They're poor, not very graduates, they're black.
They will never have refugee status.
They will always be confined to that of a migrant on the move.
When the Syrians take a few weeks to reach Europe, they take several years.
Many remain stuck in Libya.
Some are murdered there for no reason.
Many are dying on their way to the Sahara.
The desert is littered with corpses.
The idea came to me in April: I was queuing up in a VAS for my computer.
A nice pensioner came to sit next to me, to look for company.
She asked me what my job was.
So I said, report back to Africa.
She said, "My poor man, it mustn't be funny. ”
I said, "No, I like it." ”
"I don't understand why these people come to our house.
There are no jobs for them.
Are they coming for the allocs?
Afterwards they sleep on my landing and they feel strong. ”
So I said, "Madame, I know where they came from and you'd do the same." ”
My ticket number was finally out, I got up, draped in my dignity, and then I wondered: do we really know why they leave, these people?
Those who do not flee a war.
Are they really better at home?
So I looked for a country whose people would flee en masse and that would not be at war.
It was not very difficult, the International Organization for Migration had just released a report, and the country whose largest number of absolute nationals had attempted to cross the Mediterranean between January and March 2015 was the Gambia.
More than Syria, more than Nigeria.
Nigeria has a population of 175 million.
The Gambia: 1.9.
Very small country.
It was a general rescue.
I wanted to understand.
Of course, there were clues: a dictator who arrived by a coup in 94, Yaya Jammeh -- claims that he can cure AIDS with a beverage based on plants and verses from the Koran, which makes his opponents disappear, when they are not shot in public.
There were economic indicators: 1,700 dollars of GDP per capita, which puts the country 210th out of 230.
Human development.
They're 172nd out of 187.
In short, misery.
Once I was there, I realized that it was even more complicated.
It's always like that.
We're always found on the spot.
It was a mixture of poverty, ignorance, hope, social pressure that drove young people to leave.
And there was absolutely nothing that could deter them from doing so.
That's why I followed the path, I went all the way to Agadez, the migration hub.
And that's why I want to talk to you tonight about everything we think we know about migrants and that's absolutely wrong.
First misconception: it's great to cross; with all this money, they couldn't have done anything else?
Handing a box?
Well, no.
Because they don't leave with all the money they need for their journey, they don't have it.
They work on the way.
Consider the 25-year-old Jamal Barry meeting in the Gambia near Serekunda.
Djamal makes furniture.
When I met him, his last order was one month ago: two armchairs, a double sofa, a 3-seater sofa.
Paid 450 dalasis by his boss.
EUR 9 for 12 working days.
Djamal's parents died, he had four siblings, he wanted to send money from Europe, and then like many, he had to stop in Libya.
He had no money at all.
He had been picked up at the checkpoint of all the countries crossed.
So, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Libya.
And then he was kidnapped.
And then he got sick.
So he came home after eight months.
He still drew me the truck on which the Tuaregs are transporting migrants to the Sahara.
You can see, these are cages arranged to store as much as possible.
He was sitting at the end of a beam.
He had to hang on not to fall because the truck doesn't stop.
At the beginning of the journey, they were tight.
And less and less, because they swayed the bodies of those who died of dehydration in the desert.
He said, "Every day, I'm going to go back because here I'm already dead." ”
The second misconception.
They are unfair.
They are abandoning their countries that need these vital forces.
It's exactly the opposite: they leave to help the family.
In Africa, there is no pension insurance.
Children insure their parents'old's old days.
Take the case of this gentleman, Balamin Jaiteh.
The picture he takes in his hands is that of his son, Yankuba.
Yankuba was 23 years old when he tried the trip, he too was thinking of reaching Europe, and he too had to stop in Sebha, Libya.
And he wasn't lucky.
Libyans were looking for an African from his ghetto.
It is these houses where migrants crowd before they can continue.
He told them that he didn't know where he was.
He was told, "You're lying, you blacks, you all know each other." ”
They watered it with gasoline.
They scratched a match.
Yankuba died burned alive.
His father took days to talk to me, he felt guilty.
He said, "I, too, did that in 1975.
I worked in Mali, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Côte d’Ivoire, Niger and Libya.
It's normal to help his old parents, by the way all the time he could work, he sent us money; you know, we were able to make the house again. ”
His wife stared at the ground.
One of her daughters went into hiding to cry.
When I asked Balamin, "You forbade your sons to leave?"
Did you tell them it was dangerous?
He said, "No, not clearly. ”
For the time being, it is not a source of money that it can deprive itself of.
The third misconception.
They're not that poor, they have cell phones.
So, yes, they have cell phones, they sometimes even have that.
No electricity, no running water but smartphones.
Not last-known, old imitations that take hours to recharge, hours to display a web page.
Because the most fearsome, the liar is not the little hunger-hit of Agadez who enshrins the migrants in the back of his pickup.
No, it's the Internet.
These are social networks.
They spend hours dreaming in front of the pictures of those who have already passed through Europe, and dreaming that one day too they will manage to cross.
Fourth misconception.
They will all sweep over France to catch family allowances.
No, it's on the verge of the vexant, I know, but not one has talked about France.
At the bus station in Niamey, the capital of Niger, I spoke with a Malian who insisted on speaking to me in English, because his boss was from Nigeria, so English-speaking, he wanted to practice his English.
It was aimed at Europe, but not at all France.
England or especially Germany.
Even the Senegalese ghettos of Agadez, they dream of Germany, they don't even know we don't even speak French there.
As for the allocs, no one knows that there is.
Let's go a little detour to Kenya.
This is Farhiyo Salah, 22.
Farhiyo grew up in the world's largest refugee camp, on the border with Somalia, it's called Dadaab.
Today, there are 350,000 people.
When I met her in July, she had just obtained a scholarship to study in Canada.
She said, "All my life, I've been assisted by NGOs, now I want to have my job, earn my own money, become independent.
That way, I'll come back, and I'll change the status of women in Africa. ”
Farhiyo wants to become a diplomat or gynaecologist, not have 8 children at the expense of Canada.
Finally, the fifth misconception: there are too many problems at home, they will always dream of Europe.
There's nothing to do.
Yes and no.
Europe is this place from which the brothers write: "Come only, there is work to be done here." But for most of those I talked to, if they had had a choice, they would have done as they did as previous generations: they would have migrated inside Africa, and especially in Libya.
The first time Usmane Sawo, 38, went to Libya was in 2008.
He stayed two and a half years.
He was a mason.
He earned about 200 euros a month.
He was able to build his house in the Gambia.
It became too dangerous, one of his friends died before his eyes.
He's back.
In 2013, there was no money at all.
He said he would do as everyone else would and try to go to Italy.
As a boat, he was in prison for six months in Tripoli, because of a scam by his smuggler.
Ousmane, today, wins in the Gambia, on days when he has work, 4 euros.
For children's schooling and food alone, it spends 3.
He said, "It's all I have to do is make tea at home to get past my budget."
Every day God does, I pray that none of my children will get sick, because I couldn't get him treated. ”
As the Senegalese of Agadez told me, "Madame, we have to cross, because it's not going to Libya. ”
They said, "Madame, the worst thing is to die poor."
So we have no choice. ”
Even if they are afraid, even though they have seen the images of shipwrecks on France 24.
They said, "Madame, death is nothing, we try luck." ”
That's why it would never be worth anything about closing the borders.
Because as long as these young Africans do not have the hope for a better life, for a very short time, at home they will continue to come.
And you see, we, too, would do the same thing.
Thank you.
(Applause)
