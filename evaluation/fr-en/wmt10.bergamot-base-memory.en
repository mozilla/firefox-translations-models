Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway, spending 26 hours and being the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The US$1.4 million degree, medal and cheque will be presented to him for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple’s schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will be on its peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize in the Committee's own.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort until a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, something that none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate them to charities, but he has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was reluctant at that price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He has also repeatedly said that this is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement, he said it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litoměřice charged with blackmail the president of the association Society of the Protectors of the Nature of Litoměřice.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his call, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting dumpsters are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague anyone can sort its beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting dumpsters on every street corner.
And to Brno?
There, you would have to take several minutes before you find the right dumpsters.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the trash in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can only sort paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of many dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires mostly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found so far is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't blame me, but it seems to me damn little.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So finally, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by their part.
Myself, after a party, I offered to throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aesthetics do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to confirm my impression with official statistics after having dragged a while on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire Moravia region of the South.
Paroubek's budget took out money from pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or civil servants, it may be that there is a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international legal proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some classes, they were based on the fact that the government would borrow for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back to later, mining the ground," Janota said.
You should know that on the money borrowed the interest to be paid is higher and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have a choice to know where to draw money.
If he does not lower social assistance or his spending, he will have to raise taxes.
To all those that the left has currently increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater debt from the state - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota the debt will thus grow faster and faster and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase the VAT or reduce the maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
He will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections already decided and started, the projects of which cannot be modified to possibly reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major projects, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very adroitly - it will draw on the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electrical energy), which the State has for the most part and will supply the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a well without a fund.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP under EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million in the two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which is intended to track each administration's spending online.
The first step will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed appear promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which is mainly involved in the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices in 2012.
The snow shortage in the mountains is bothering hoteliers
Deserted tracks are not only a problem for climbers.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and boarding houses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our website.
Internet users browse offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in Špindler currently offer only week-long New Year stays.
I think they will try for a while to place them, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease,” Jandura said.
The Ingtours tourist agency of the Vrchlabí also still offers free beds for all winter periods.
Christmas week is the most interesting for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared a few cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell moderately.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be full, "thinks Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February is selling well too, "says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty for Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the moment.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again, said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hoteliers of the Krkonoše, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But afterwards, the weather should warm up, informs Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is a mother of wisdom
He even becomes a comic, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, president with a reputation as a sage, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered himself very simple.
When he ended up allowing his long-awaited doctrine to sweat, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content with using in the text even several times the expression "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of the speech of Bush of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-consumed Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at the moment do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favourable final situation than one could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
Campaign commanders again called for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the White House's reluctance despite habits of subordination.
He asked for 40 000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least defrauded the general of 10 000 soldiers.
He managed to extirpate the promise of an additional 5 000 from Europe, even if he originally counted on 10 000.
What brings the most trouble into Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this entire process within three years. All of Obama’s doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will bring the same fruits as the progression in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders on a day-to-day basis, depending on what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity on the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state that is quick to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy puzzles by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and reality-free heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent in the tumult of the war in view of their "prompt return home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it the indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of a resolution of the problem through the use of military force.
This will be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior senior executive employees at the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Actions can be taken from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link retributions with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting itself aside almost US$17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to allocate a single tax of fifty percent of bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
Five women, a record number, were awarded the Nobel Prizes in technical and literature in Stockholm today in Stockholm by the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave.
Besides the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their compatriot Jack Szostak received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosomes
The last winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the Monetary Award.
It reaches ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (about 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The highly anticipated Nobel Peace Prize winner has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their appointment on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus for signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for the fact that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer's government, which he said must stem the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but does not oblige anything to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefrencing deficit" of public finances.
Now, according to him, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is staggering and that the government should question its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer functioning.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts."
ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is appalling and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD described the ratification of the state budget for the next year as successful.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to star Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the lead roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus – Undefeated will expose many things to the world about the country, its fights and victories.
History is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fight against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to play you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood’s Milion Dollar Baby drama in the boxing world has, for example, played the leader of a movement against slavery that has become slaves himself, a fictional president of the United States, or even God in the film Evan Almighty but never anyone still alive and so much.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country’s president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can join his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the underdogs in the world.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in a way that brought him closest to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it is transmitted and I felt like I knew how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon stars in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby world.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang the door of the house, it opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’
Despite the differences between actors and real-life models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and we even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety magazine summarized his appreciation in these words: “It’s a very good story, a very well-made movie.”
In the film reviews on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway was observed.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch was again a failure, however, and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian military, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th trial was conducted at the beginning normally.
It's only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the equipment again.
It was obviously the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving and submerged boat
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely was likely caused by a faulty "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we can not speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage only hit the third.
In the preceding cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Defense Ministry management considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetissov will again show up in a professional match at 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably enter already in the game on Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty years in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played for Hartford for a whole season and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also received tributes in NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vaněk of Hyundai factory confirmed this.
However, the management wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was offered on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The website Sedmička.cz said the company has offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who will be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the extra hours supplement, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holiday season told Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturdays will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of both the unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the auto factory were forced to work almost two hours daily in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday they were ready to stop the strike in the event of an agreement on their demands and the signing of a joint document.
The situation in the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of relentless overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged hazing.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the imperatives in terms of car production.
During the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also called for employees who stopped production to be subject to no sanctions.
The unions are calling on the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a retribution of 5 000 crowns (about € 209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2 000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "enduring" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the upper hand over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, the lives of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a series of side effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have any effect.
The work of the experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Prague VŠCHT and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metalocarbonanes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new “improved” substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on the virus’ proteins.
Metalocarbonans have a single three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metallic atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If the HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, the researchers said in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes and on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to be examined for the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Biochemistry.
Argument around the budget. The ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the budget ratified for the following year "staggering" and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS’s remarks a drastic verdict.
He says he takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether he will rely in the Chamber of Deputies on the minority who are concerned about the fight against the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for the year 2010 on Wednesday, with, however, the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Chamber increased money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's objection to the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDO left the room before the vote, obeying the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad variant than an acting budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still think about the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his time in the government:
He said at the same time that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who have imposed the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing laws such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the services law.
Topolánek: the ministers appointed by the ODS are not involved.
This is the business of the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO have done nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are calling for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of fighting the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House. "
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda so I will devote myself to it, said from the House to the journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked the Democratic deputies to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he said to the question of whether the SDO had not been reproached by the Party president in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I gave up my term that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevization of the House and a destruction of everything positive, Reacted Topolánek himself.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit from 13 December certain less loaded express or regional trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease on the day of entry into force of the new schedules by two percent compared to today.
Most pricing will not change, including base rates and reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the biggest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region by eight percent in total, but Prague and its surroundings can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which is possible to open thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart in intervals of two hours.
Guests can no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
This year’s bill for regional railways: 200 million more crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are controlled by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to the tune of almost three billion.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not resort to a price increase in the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect ČD Net day tickets and eLiška discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities in a region of your choice and was at a single fare of 160 kronor.
The Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, the children were released
The rebels today abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including a few primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but which originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a flight from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settling of scores between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the southern Philippines province of Maguindanao because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history is about everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrases part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter went to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he was then awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparation for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are currently rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "strut".
Morgan Freeman is, however, taking up his own words, proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to be able – as they say – to recover from his energy, he said at the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember the personality and message of Mandela via the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual has added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave the people their creation depicted the South African human rights defender during his term of office as president.
Morgan Freeman tried during the film to glue two racial groups of a long divided population and as well as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won then.
For showing up on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people again in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
South African whites, however, are sceptical, as recently said in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of burning crowns in the Louny region
A fire engulfed a transformer of the Čeps company in the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku in the morning.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the firefighters of Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to allow the transformer to consume themselves, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokeswoman of the company Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, the company Čeps has not known anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electric power supplies have not been interrupted, says ČEZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, administrations and industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission assemblies and power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission assemblies to distribution assemblies and line layouts of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura to file defamation complaint against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will today file a defamation complaint against three democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated this in Radiožurnál's Dvacet minut.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions have ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claim that we make the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
All we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's filing of a complaint represents the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free publicity to his company and to his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek said
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable steps of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intended to take it back after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broadest sense.
Jančura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway links for an order of about 150 billion kroners, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought threats to Jančura from a ČSSD deputy.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He ran as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is, but I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will reverse old habits in January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal disease culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August kids.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If we started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay for the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
However, parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 kronor in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Until now, the State has spent about 500 000 kronor per year on all vaccination of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococci.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we were able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococci.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society for Pediatricians, acknowledges that a voluntary vaccination will be defected.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a decrease in the renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" says however Cabrnochová.
Specialists predict that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococci also marks a rupture of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is, however, related to the concerns of the pediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the sums of health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40 000 kronor per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It'll be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars (12 million GBP) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum's entrance into the Pocono Mountains area.
M. 81-year-old Frazetta Senior is famous for her drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP cited a police official that the young M. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, the said Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been allowed by her father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
M. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and the spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Tories said that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about the decrease in the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also drew lightning by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Wrath of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and have warned that "problems" are announced.
The decline in Social Insurance – which will get about 3 billion GBP a year – has made the world of companies angry, because according to him, it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in the corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Electric car and wind turbine tax bills
Retirement increase of 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person earning 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person earning 10,000 GBP per year will earn 110 GBP more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 resulted in "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the top 5 % of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
M. Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year – much worse than the 3.5 percent decline predicted in April – while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed Opportunity"'
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said plans to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years were unsustainable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" evading difficult choices until after the elections - which are scheduled to be held in June 2010.
“They didn’t present anything significant about what they were going to do,” said Philip Hammond, chief Treasury Secretary of the Shadow Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, whoever the winner is"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from the next reductions, unlike the Tory’s proposals, which would lead to a faster and larger reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised from rising taxes and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending and not to downgrade, arguing that plans were “constructed on wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said the timing of the announcements – such as the rise in inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above, would leave the Chancellor in the face of propaganda accusations, with the money simply recovering the following year.
However, the Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that fiscal spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the Chancellor’s figures involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said Director Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Economic Advisor to Accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report. The markets are well aware of this.”
FBI investigates "arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who were declared missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are being held,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
Katherine Schweit, a spokesman for the FBI, said the agency had knowledge of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said the house was already being monitored by local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. must “collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuse'
Over the past two decades, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report claimed that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-respect for human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International has reported the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of ‘working with Facebook’s networks’ and protesting against the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on the neck, on the head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, election-losing candidate Mehdi Karroubi claimed that protesters held after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been locked in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary will establish a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government's response, but it has stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies are unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee have not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an attempt to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the trail of Brandon Hill Park, a small springboard preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city twinkling below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prizes have rewarded the best aerobatics - or figures made on the track.
After the party on Thursday night, the snow will be abandoned to the cast iron.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the latest book of the author, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
The last book of M. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious fabric.
A good anthropologist, he doesn’t just want to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country right now.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what MM. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers for a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia that today make up a small portion of the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be reached with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the so virulent guardian intellectual elite of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it up is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
As a connector of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were proving themselves by hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspirant who had only to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their newly killed mother, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the area needed for an adult in freedom; the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae that grew in its thick fur.

M. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often looks back at the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter fighters and Inuit indians in motorcycleskiing use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what the future may be out there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not for lack of trying.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys gave the first information on the melting of the ice sheet.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the landform changes under it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
M. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the tributary system of Arctic ice, formed by the wild water nets pressed as you freeze.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6 000 people who laid crowns on the graves in Arlington
The 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson first class made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6 000 volunteers to have gathered Saturday morning to lay crowns on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16 000 crowns on the tombs of Arlington Cemetery around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the site of the Memorial for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150 000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Piled up in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose old tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the fresh pine wreaths on the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on the top.
Nearby, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1 000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying and families and friends were bragging in the cold air.
Some read out loud the names carved in the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, embedded in the damp earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to gather at the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in action in July.
No one should ever forget what we are free to... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. national arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana is trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The precise accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an increasing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husband is and she is being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but permissions have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a “soft” approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can make the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although these are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day of pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to connect should communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press secretary to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
One activity that, in any other public company, would be allowed — distributing mobile phones free of charge — is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called “New Castro, even Cuba,” referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country’s leader to replace Fidel, his ill elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposedly preparing a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan in an attempt to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who are scouring the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the Internet-based YouTube video site.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service official who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not participating in the CIA’s plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east that became a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition that he remain anonymous because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men - who remain in Pakistan and who are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining who is trusting.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence service has had the priority of infiltrating men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert on the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention, in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for “action” for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets here on Saturday calling for greater climate action from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center convention center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100 000 people, but 25 000 according to the estimates of the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings, downtown.
On that day when little happened during the United Nations-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched around the city, deploying placards in English saying ‘There is no planet B’ and one in Spanish, stating “Earth says it has had enough.”
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s homeland, Peru, has opened her eyes to the heartbreaking issues facing the country because of the impact of climate change that is already happening.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- spread the word and appeal to leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and engaged decisions," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists who wore masks and black clothes, lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were rockets first, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the course, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciences of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it's something I was not aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking may seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they are hurting the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent differences between races
Last week’s federal report on math results brought good news for Washington D.C.’s public schools.
Although the District still remains far behind leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white Grade 4 children (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased from 262 to 270 in the past two years (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only from one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the Group Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrats) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing,” said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for equality in education in the District.
I don’t jump for joy for one or two points won,” said Kwame R. Brown (Apparent Democrat), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message of the test results is that the city’s middle schools are in desperate need of attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what is scary is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of struggling students.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, targeting elementary school and early elementary school school schoolchildren who did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier in their academic journey and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the Math Program, for Kindergarten (Kindergarten) classes at Grade 6 (6th) emphasizes games and real-life experiences, as they were set up in the District by former official Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to provide better interventions for these lower-level students than the classroom," Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with poorer results in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies city test results.
The conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can have political implications that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focused on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they are from, are assured that their children will be able to get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements in closing the success gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers’ union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a “starting point” to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, goes down and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
Great Here is where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them towards the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said thoughtful, when she was told the low ratio of professor of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children were visiting during their three-day discovery journey and now they had completely incorporated the message: The question is not whether you are going to college:
Question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who have left high school where parents have become a teenager, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from the university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a "second-generation hispanic" out of five is pursuing his high school education -- a notable success when we consider that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having finished high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers studying the fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many also set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them,” said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We have to think about offering a support network to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepares you), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university readiness programs that begin when students of low-income families are in middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry secures agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract significant oil companies in order to rebuild its struggling infrastructure in two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are on the verge of playing a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have left with a stake in just two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who had put an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are Asian and European companies that are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdraw have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from joining Iraq with more force, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and more likely to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest United States companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which had strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and had provided it with technical advice, had left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has more bid on contracts than other companies and has left with significant interests in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies for auctions made bids that were then compared to the price per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, counterintelligence authorities said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian secret service member said, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Authorities said suspicious local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies."
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida’s military organizers who were leading the group’s terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of the al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the US authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida’s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to the general American public, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second prominent figure in al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have advanced to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday that he would step down from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous term tainted by allegations of widespread corruption during the UN-backed presidential elections.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30 000 troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase, but expressed concern about the US timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview with Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply fulfill his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a two-month void between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun to look for a replacement.
Representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but he said that Galbraith's accusations -- which was dismissed -- "harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism about international observation of the elections."
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the UN’s heavy hiring regulations are hindering its opportunities to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world’s major powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a base of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I have learned anything in Iraq in the last six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a package of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be in less security with nuclear weapons” because “his people would suffer enormously” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "likely" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he said he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agree to abandon a significant portion of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts to agree – in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s stiffening in the face of some of the international community’s proposals for which they had in fact given their agreement in early October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as Iran’s deadline to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement in New York on Thursday, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls “baseless allegations” by some members of the Security Council about Iran’s nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, “in order to achieve a long-term, satisfactory solution.”
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurdish anxiety about the withdrawal in suspense. U.S. authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave."
They have learned so well the lesson that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no seconds left, said Wang, 31, a human resources director with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said fertile couples must have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of manpower in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual mitigation
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines - up to three times their annual income - and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women of a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys – abnormally high girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of retailing regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples, at their home, and slip leaflets under their doorstep.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai say they saw an increase in requests for records of couples wishing for a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu commune, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the one-child policy to be a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of luck having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, the Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted an only child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us."
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, says so more crudely.
For couples working together, middle-class, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference — characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations — came back in the spotlight on Friday, due to the release of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations weighing most of the burden in the coming times.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it has illuminated the way to go.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in negotiations that is short of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world coming next week to Copenhagen.
Drafted by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both over the course and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could decrease their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative at Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s Executive Secretary-General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as “the full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiations, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher on China than the Bush administration was tough two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions by the major developing countries, says Stern who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the U.S. lead negotiator either lacked “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China financially to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the world’s major powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States quarreling over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should be subject to the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters responsible for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, which is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure on a legally obliging treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unity of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the full political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they ask emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the pending issues before heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and information conferences, so they could make claims that will be considered in the following week.
The real image of the rally -- in which 13 000 people enter and leave the Convention Centre every day -- guitar activists present nighttime shows that they believe are becoming betrayed and proposals are being written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle will break through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution in transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, as it runs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter and the passage of aircraft and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears of environmental dangers risk curbing British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line from London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y-setup for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It seems like it will be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK’s fastest network in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow 400m long trains that can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham route.
A terminal that can accommodate 20000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project needs to be in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first of all be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure that aircraft passes through trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay back GBP 75,000 loan for the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of parliament Tory, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension at his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler."
M. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for fun".
Mr. was not asked to Duncan to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Committee on Privileges and Standards, concerning its pre-borrowing provisions.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, M. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing 271,406 GBP from his London property from his constituency house that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of borrowed interest until March last year.
In April, his applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. M.'s RBS borrowing Duncan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the borrowing of 75,000 GBP.
The RBS standard variable interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask for 1,250 GBP in May.
M. Duncan lost his position as Shadow Cabinet Office in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him stating that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on a budget" and you're treated like "m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil dealer, began to have to explain his expenses, in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of the costs that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in M Duncan's lawn, protesting after it was revealed that he had been asking for 4,000 GBP for three years.
When asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved by both the fee bureau and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evading or drafting or using the rules or anything.
This was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar
The beach cabins of Brighton have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using Christmas carols as a theme.
The event began on December 1st, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17h30 to 18h30, every day, with pâtés and mulled wine served free of charge.
The Christmas carols chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we wait for people to enter into a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the beach cabin Advent calendar came just after a conversation with a few friends, over dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police have carried out several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is responsible for reaching an agreement that can come into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, said the growing climate mobilisation around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, helped to make the "political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, entirely dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
Riot police immediately intervened unceasingly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had distinguished themselves in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night "handcuffed and kept in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been erected to welcome the speakers planned, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by coach and by train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue waterproofs, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can not continue to say to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, marched in red, sporting bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17h00 GMT.
The turnout was 58% hours before the closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which left several thousand dead, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large signs showing M. Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are settled everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, by raising a glass of vodka.
For his part, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Butba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as that giving in to Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: World protests, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the line, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, seeking an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of Parliament, the procession, generally good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are held.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to get in.
A scene had been erected to welcome the speakers planned, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, entirely dressed in black, armed with bricks and hammers, broke windows, said an AFP journalist.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened unceasingly, throwing several of them ashore.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members "of the Black Blocs", these ultra-violent small groups that had distinguished themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We have in the eye the small extremist groups, warned the spokesman of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police were turning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by coach and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue waterproofs, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and sporting bandanas touting solar energy in front of the town hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The history-geo emerges strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "strengthening" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in scientific terminale.
From now on, first-time students will all have four hours of the week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "we must get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "basically, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-sectors of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of history-geography in terminale in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven in ten French (69%) disapprove of the government's plan to suppress compulsory history-geography education in S-terminal. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the terminale S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also follow internships in situation during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
A Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, took up Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, said an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the Edouard Hannezo conference, 22, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
We choose about twenty speakers from among the experts in their discipline and we select them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk about the hours, but we can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but using graphs, in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific file".
Videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Payment delays: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Prison supervisors' unions on Friday called for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of year holidays of premiums and overtime, the payment of which has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", considering "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Autonomous Federal Union of Prisons (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but assure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which has been born of a poor assessment of overtime, does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for management staff benefiting from the famous premiums of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "the budgetary constraints have good backs".
It is a pure scandal, has indignant the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the denarius of the staff, believes the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less off than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the secretary general of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he offers "howker stuff" than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas in the White House, told the "papess" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give things nicer than those I receive."
As part of a special that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse into how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, adding that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has written down against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you some cool gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before humorously replying by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who did you give that?"
During this one-hour show, with the casual atmosphere, with the famous host who was a strong supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama spoke of a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father that he rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than fixing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles because of significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "delisions resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, adding that these injuries had "necessitated a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, wanted to be reassuring, saying the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor very well known in the artistic milieu.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on the information of RTL.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a relative of Johnny Hallyday, said Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured to have "no worries" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation, it's not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stained".
M. Camus also said she spoke with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had had surgery on a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as expected his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medallist at the Worlds-2009 in the large pool, won an international title Thursday on a distance he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records broken while we were waiting for a surge.
One was upgraded by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay men 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who looked at the world record of the free 50 m, of which he holds the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the free 50 m is the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatia’s Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia’s Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisioned.
We can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1st.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the grand basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give it my all about this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann said.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A panel of Roman sarcophagus that belonged in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday 1.5 million dollars, clearly above its estimate, announced the art dealer Sotheby's.
This front panel two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have bid the most so far, told AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back a few days.
The panel remained for nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively in the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and at Paul Reynaud's house, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There remained a shadowy area of about fifty years.
While searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe-conduct by the coup government.
For the moment, after a phone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican government's plane, has left for its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him a safe-conduct.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a visiting sitting head of state.
The coup government "has had another failure in wanting me to give up my office ... they wanted me to resign," Mr. said Thursday. Zelaya on Globo radio, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing a few chords the deposed president, a refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has applied for safe-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, said Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country, replied Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Rumors of Mr.'s departure Zelaya had mobilized Wednesday the supporters of the deposed president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" that the justice accuses him of, according to the coup government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial vote recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against Mr. M. Zelaya in power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street is rising, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up higher on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures reflecting the recovery in business of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq advanced 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index won 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focusing on "the glass half full".
According to Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on US trade balance figures, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to 32.9 billion dollars.
Analysts expected the deficit to increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, that reflects the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against all odds last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest level in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and the 30-year Treasury yield at 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power conspue the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday conspired wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dames in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conspired in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, said an AFP journalist.
Down with the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with their fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police, said an AFP journalist.
Police forced dissidents who were conspired by government supporters to be forcibly mounted in civilian vehicles, according to the journalist.
The arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", numbering 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain in the ground.
Cuban authorities view opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s protest of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, including expression.
A madman kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), an hour away, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly beat with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, according to police sources and witnesses.
Seriously injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the police union Alliance, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his 30s, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The days of the other wounded are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made discomfort and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passers-by, apparently randomly: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script was still confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried on the cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the madman.
I saw a guy in my 30s with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn't get there because the guy was strong, Alberto reported, waiter of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Also boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of n°61, two municipal policemen, including their official, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with punches, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was a person injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put her in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later came a second person in his 30s, who was wounded with a knife.
It was the number of the national police who arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office has referred the matter to the Hauts-de-Seine Department of Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to subdue him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitation" as "all the fraunted of this species whose forces increase tenfold under the effect of action".
Polanski's lawyer again calls for prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the abandonment of the lawsuits against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer for the "Pianist", denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977 before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now, Mr. said. Hummel, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband - who has since died -- had discussed, before handing down his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But M. Wells had finally said at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In case the court refuses to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before the sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant Attorney Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "must be there to report to the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, while despising his authority".
One of the three judges — who now have 90 days to make their decision — also stressed “that there are other alternatives to the flight.”
M. Hummel was not the only one to call for the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for an end to the prosecution once again.
Recalling that her client can no longer stand to be harassed with every twist of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, held back by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "have helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery," analysts at Charles Schwab said.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3 percent in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also recovered sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
The indices were, however, held back by a further increase in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which "pushes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick, of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and the 30-year Treasury yield to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Miss World's election again in South Africa
After a month of travel through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to cross the last straight line Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty mass organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their tickets for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportswoman or Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and had so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17H00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to put my crown back on.
This experience was fascinating.
I'm happy to have lived it twice, emphasizes Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press encounters and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and presented in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It is every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, China’s Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who shook their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the football World Cup of June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could come near.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, Enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he had to go to the bedside of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, told the press David Hallyday at his exit from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13h00 local (21H00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he was going to go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant lesions resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning where their daughter Jade is attending school, to attend a school show, an AFP photographer said.
The head of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go Monday to Los Angeles to the singer.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Mr. said. Camus.
I heard about a possible legal process coming, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "left much too quickly for Los Angeles, with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and it had stunned me, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "left without drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly convicted by the justice, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the intervention had "perfectly gone well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in brackets.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ed.) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and sums up the New Center to no longer use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted Friday to the attempt of takeover bid of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by putting it in notice to no longer use it on any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to retrieve the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, has come out of its silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the deputy, summoning them not to use the acronym and to transmit to them the ownership of the brand, under penalty of legal proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to +resume +represent' the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it appropriate to follow up on your militant material and on the cover page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New center +, the slogan +the UDF of today +, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which puts the CN on notice to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium as well as of (its) website".
He also asked Hervé de Charette "to transmit the ownership of (the) trademark to his legitimate assigns".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories will be notified.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Center therefore has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its membership of the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continues the office, "when he registered the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He takes the scandalous and fraudulently advantage of the failure to deposit the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to plunder her of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the empire of L'Oréal cosmetics.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collectively by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the prosecutor's office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors designated Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'll talk to him about it," said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, at the outset of the hearing.
For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is great news (...) The expertise will show that he (M. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has been in criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist touch-to-all, whom she accuses of having taken advantage for years of the weakness of her mother to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleas of the lawyers sometimes turned to great family unpacking Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to him since her marriage."
For her part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and does not have a guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, a representative of the public prosecutor.
The court finally ruled that it would rule once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets back to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors returns regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "demands a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision from all stakeholders"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally upset.
This is why we call for a managerial revolution that would involve putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns in the same way as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'm not.
- First of all because I could see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally happens, after many detours, to do priority... what it has always done. !
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for the world of today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a way to realize a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from reason-to-oncentional analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "at the place".
They thus create a favorable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: "just war" is worth praise to the right in Obama
The U.S. right on Friday welcomed the speech delivered the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocaded the award of the prize to Mr. Obama on October 9 applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, a regimer of the right wing of the Republican Party, to the USA Today daily, adding that she herself addressed the theme of the war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
M. Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of M. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, said the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historical, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected official, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not present a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
Michael Gerson, former pen by George W. Bush converted columnist at the Washington Post, M. Obama gave “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few on the right who is not convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “dull, light-headed and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed that Barack Obama was justifying the use of force.
When we wrap war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The center-left press, however, remained rave about the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama called his speech a “superproduction” even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily newspaper said.
M. Obama “gave the right speech,” the New York Times said, deeming it “both dark and uplifting.”
Roads: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the unions of the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained until the end, reached Friday night an agreement that puts an end to the slogan of strike and the threat to the supplies of Christmas.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" in this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, begun Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of signing quickly at the end of the morning the text of agreement.
And this even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting started at 11am for everyone to agree and that at 6pm the text was signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would come to disrupt the holiday season," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and by 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we start from a very far distance, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We will order our activists to have no blockages, no blockades of the supply centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel expenses by 3%, and the maintenance of the general conditions of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible in particular to address the question of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
M. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer's expenses" was the subject of a government amendment to the amending finance bill for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of this organization, and secondly to the entire profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", assured Mr. Bussereau.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupe market", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not at the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement is likely "to dig into the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban transit line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry about their request for a bonus.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10am and 8pm, at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at rush hour, and almost no train in off-peak hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no rush on the docks, the Ile-de-France people having organized.
Thus, in the early morning, the resort of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of middle and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had stood up "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare train station has not experienced saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a framework of agents and police.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, considered "slim" by the unions, of a meeting with the management Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career progress etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a bonus due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in brackets, the CGT was outraged, stressing that the management "was not screwed to solve a problem while among the truckers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for "a broader review of the conditions of practice of the profession", the RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company "mocked the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their careers, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for shifted schedules, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision far-reaching
Turkey’s Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a move that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community, the southeast of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr. Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party’s executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the waiver of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sitting as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party says, however, that it has "no organic ties" to the PKK but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to dry up the Kurds’ support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had said a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city of the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Police fired tear gas and used water cannons, as protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said the Justice decision would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed to the closure of the parties in principle.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the clearing and sandblasting service (FES) specifies that it is not to annoy the citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them well.
And according to the meterologists, it could be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The ESF follows a very elaborate plan.
M. Brauburger explains that as soon as it snows on the city of Frankfurt and that temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel through 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes high traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, in 3 hours maximum time.
This is why the FES service begins at 3am "so that the roads are cleared when the traffic of daily migration begins".
There or it gets harder, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7h30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the clearing and sandblasting service of the roads "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of the access roads and the service routes - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and the side streets come last.
M. Brauburger knows that this still causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES footing team is in the way to identify priority the areas considered dangerous and the passages.
As for bike paths, the services of the ESF generally cannot take care of them.
M. Brauburger specifies that there is a special service in Frankfurt which monitors the condition of the bridges between 22hours and 4h30.
Since the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles occur as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
Sometimes the police also use this special service in case of need.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have had anything exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa Hallae is one of the earliest dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico which was at the time part of the land of the supercontinent, the Pangea and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs with a new day.
Indeed, it informs us about the relationships, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in one day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Triassic.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named him Tawa after the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a quite exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but it does not allow it to confirm certain theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Among other things, experts wonder when the saurians have divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor that appeared later and descended by birds, sauropods, quadrupeds with long necks, and those related to them and ornithischian herbivores of which are part the species such as the
Based on studies from S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae possessed small aerial sacs in its bones at the level of the skull, as did the birds that are the descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small aerial sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the immense sauropods also possessed aerial sacs and a light bone, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most early known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
Therefore, the three great lines of evolution have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the land that formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers argue.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History in New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaur, which lived in present-day Poland and which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him this could give a misguided vision because there are in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while almost none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how did the dinosaurs manage to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet thus favoring the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such a success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better adapted and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite blooming of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since that time had been vegetating in the shadows: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino of J.W. University. Goethe of Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers of J.W. University Goethe but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by the striking students and teachers after walls and works of art were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured in the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the degradations did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee thus evaded the debates that would be essential.
The lecturers demand that the criminal proceedings instituted be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradations.
Legitimization of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with students.
Protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary for the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she took the case for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday during the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, expressed CDU member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, we evacuate them.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that summons the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention of the police.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for the search for secret weapons, under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet “Silicon Valley”.
Important production and research locations in micro- and nanoelectronics are located.
In September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have created links with Riedberg, a place of Frankfurt science – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Cooperation”.
The signatories were the Vice Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project section chief for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will leave for a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific Exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the growing Russian market.
Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet institutes and research societies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssizhskaja-Elektronika.
The town was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armament research.
Zelenograd (literal translation “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters, this is nothing less than “new heart of Europe”.
If we will. S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The head-on stations, with tracks that ended in the city, had a reputation at the time for being the relics of the 19th-century transport technique that had the effect of a brake hoof of modern rail traffic because it once took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That’s why the head-on stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Rail Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80's have not been compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-on-line stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is in the game because, it is the taxpayer who pays the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urbanistic point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – according to the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the expansion of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which we attributed - and this is typical of the 80's - a huge growth.
At the time, there was not yet competition from cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, is indirectly about many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabia project.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom thoroughly here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international merchandise traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment of airport
In the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, the Land government raised the possibility of appealing to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the ban on night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed experts to consider from a legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative Tribunal and which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the proposed construction of the northwest landing runway at Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air nuisances.
The coalition must have decided for January 4 if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticizes this delay and is trying to put pressure on the government's representative to give him an appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, it will be condided as a total failure to face a given word.
It is damn difficult to be allowed to keep his word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the criticism of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land government is trying to allow night flights by using "avocastry and rogary".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision based on a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
US banks pay back the aid allocated
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are breaking their ties vis-à-vis the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid 45 billion dollars (more than 30 billion Euros) to the Treasury, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp bailout.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to managers as well as the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of Americaa is launching a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors that has earned it 19 billion dollars in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's caisses, which are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the chief executive of the Bank of America, expressly thanked U.S. taxpayers: the capital injection has helped significantly overcome a difficult time.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money on the financial markets in order to free itself from the guardianship of the State.
The U.S. bank could thus launch as of Thursday a capital increase of 20 billion dollars, reported the CNBC chain citing the banking circles.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not want to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated election
Finally everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current holder of the position of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial staff of ZDF, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there has also been a willingness not to further harm the intendant of the ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the editorial staff of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors that it extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. Brender’s dismissal by vote represented a bitter, though predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not wanting to reappoint Brender.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organized a league against the editor.
He had refused that the contract of the highly estimated chief editor be extended by invoking the fact that the rate of listening to the ZDF's information broadcasts had decreased under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, criticizing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it will have been of no use.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance (Spanish) languages.
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinate radio organ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became an editor in the ZDF first of all at the news magazine "hute-journal" (journal of today).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly information program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was in charge of the foreign policy department of the ZDF then head of the Berlin editorial staff.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch’s opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not plan to request the withdrawal of political figures who are members of the ZDF surveillance committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered to the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in his decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a liberal left-wing.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was developed stating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should make it possible to close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to organise more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor’s and Master’s courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Länder Ministers of Education and the rectors of universities have constantly had fashionable expression: "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", reads a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop slippage, which was significantly detrimental to study.
In addition, "studiability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Both the modules and the background should be carefully examined to see if one can not avoid this feeling of choking that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID acquaintances about Kunduz, the opposition believes Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and room for manoeuvre to enable and foster personal initiative".
The new regulation will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the regime for examinations not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Until now, Rhineland-Palatinate has so far given its agreement to provide more resources to the development of the Bologna Process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Department
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
Following this, you will only have to take one exam to close your studies.
The organization of studies will have to be more flexible, in addition it is necessary to be able to guarantee the recognition of transcripts of other higher education institutions and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studiability" of all university cycles will have had to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the conditions of study in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Socialist Students' Union has indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy to no longer take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of the Ministers and the rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as those involved should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us" she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a draft common reform.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. He demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor of Graduate to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asked that the Länder assure today's Bachelor students that there will be enough places tomorrow for Master's studies and the goodest conditions of study as possible.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words “Arrive in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...” that begins a work by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematizes in snippets of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently as a collector in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry from the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hojak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer whom he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner was awarded the German Language Award in 1989 in conjunction with some of the participants.
Enlistment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner “so someone who has not sufficiently resisted the intimidation of the Securitate.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary entanglements with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abysses and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as can be said from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate’s spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper “Die Zeit”, after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and will sometimes have guessed what real names were last hiding the assumed names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate’s files is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and slowed down in the past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged since.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very dismissive way towards the laureate.
She had psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many unsustainable questions are associated with the Söllner case as happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who was plundered? The weighted reaction of the listeners, in Söllner’s admission, gives hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received yesterday the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults in the Champions League
One had the impression that a representative was coming there, pulled four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross went up at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes C-class, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50s could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was also not drunk with happiness.
He had a pleasant evening but tomorrow we had to go back to work.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of the Swiss that we had just engaged three days earlier were clear: “We reached the eighth final”, that is to say in the league of champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania” but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back.”
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
This is to repeat to Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw to lot
The Champions League eighth final (match go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminating entry into office of Babbel’s successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had brought luck, who had passed on to the destabilized professionals of Stuttgart, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber of souls" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well that was no longer effective with the healer Babbel.
He started a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes happens things that we would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury breaks, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” observed by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the new leader’s working method: “He is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet reached the milestone, warns manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs especially tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having a bad awakening in Leverkusen four days later with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn’t have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the game began.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered, in response to Lehmann’s sharp criticism.
He had accused the direction of weakness of style and said that she had decided to change coaches under pressure from pubertarian fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy made his day of free after the matches being suppressed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness” buried Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life these two forty-year-olds.
In any cast, they agreed for everything else, that is to say that without the group’s previous work by the coach replaced, the strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a big part in success” countered Heldt and Lehmann in a choir – and even the man with a plastic bag nodded.
World Heavyweight Championship
Warm fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger provoked constantly verbally and gestually the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavyweights according to the version of the federation WBC.
Unanimously the judges he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points victory at the unaminity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he did not succeed in the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, who emerged 39 times victorious in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first loss in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko especially wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, by its left-hand.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous counter right into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried to skip the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having passed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him “naughty zombie” who “is not really capable.”
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion could not help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from the nose “to be able to see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerien Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had had to give up without a fight before.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in this fight and am in perfect shape,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His state is to try to reunite the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is the champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Haye who, having detonated the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had canceled a match against Vitaly Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is planning to play this match now at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defense Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and La Gauche (die Linke) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest intelligence on the Kunduz air strike, the opposition blamed Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a untruth" on the deadly strike of two tanker trucks last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the news broadcast of the channel ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
In short, it means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report before NATO that has been read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the lafrappe was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was aimed at eliminating two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the US air strike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghan policy if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have endorsed this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancery has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing stronger to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the information in the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on the tanker trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they allegedly concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed from the Minister some embarrassing details.
In the entourage of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein as well as a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on the charges and referred the federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which would build the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dreaming
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the effect of the drug, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in dreams and wildest fantasies.
However, he who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices do not only appear in the mentally ill or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes encourages the limits between dreaming, madness and reality to blend.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most diverse forms, in the best case, this is called visions, at worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect stand out, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There is hallucinations or delusions when balance, neurotransmitting substances in the brain – primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and achetylcholine – breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often manifest during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly force of attraction has no more power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakened dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It’s autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with screaming colors.
The earthly attraction has no more power over it, it hovers at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him creatures of winged, grimacing devil, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Thunderous, mean voices, scream, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer support them as those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from its stereo, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is coming off.
Let it serve as a lesson to you, shout the voices in a choir to tear the eardrum off. "Go to a clinic and get treatment!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitement, which make them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the center of the situation, all to a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis, is fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make these kinds of convertibles, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people concerned have tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs says.
But what is still unexplained is how the abnormality of the neural system occurs and moreover the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten de Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been gathering reports for ten years on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Heads".
Hunculinations are indeed part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
They include psychological disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are overactive or not sufficiently reburned; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, heartbreaks or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Previous Pomerania and goes to high school.
A normal girl to actually say.
If there were no images and voices.
During recess, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades, she looks at her, amazed – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn’t dream, she’s sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It’s a pleasant feeling, she finds this young friendly.
Am I crazy?, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this young person and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, it happens that she cannot take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations on the board.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that arrives too rarely and far too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dreams already, if the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody notches on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she shouts to these creatures.
She doesn’t talk to her parents or her friends, they would take her for a crazy woman.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact via the internet with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain isn’t busy enough, so there’s animation.
Sarah K., the only girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it’s very difficult for people like Sarah K to tell the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, nightlife is also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too centered on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the modification of the awakened consciousness by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that it cannot differentiate from the dream even when it is in a state of awakening.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who fully aware, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world is taking place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is in fact an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, a capacity for organization given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real later in memories.
The Zurich-based Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of the Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, at a time when his conscious leaves on a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain still in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from scratch, visit foreign places, travel back in time. He sees himself as an old man who is a bed in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the vene of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has been through.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At 27 years old, the children will take over from the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda Publishing is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% of a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are firmly committed to joining the company, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
You will also have to see if they are capable of it.
You can't impose your children on 7500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to take care of them.
It would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that he was stepping down from the post of Chairman and CEO in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the link of the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda says the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who have allowed themselves to be dragged by a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power," Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of country tutor as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on far too much importance.
Full beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the goal that El Corte Inglés has set itself, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d’Or, which has a gym, or L’Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding department, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxed area to organize your own “Beauty Party” with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” who guide customers’ steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (warming and stretching included), is enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied cleanings
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, has the electric car
The power company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento in Barcelona, has created the “Oficina LIVE”.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The “Oficina LIVE” (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will set up agreements on mobility, by carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will get involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company takes part in standardisation groups at European level and has in progress a set of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, foresees “a future of tranquility” for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites,” said the President of the government.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has spent 800 million euros on the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3 000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support the application, referring to Plan 2000E, put in place in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20 000 m2 of classic cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collectible Cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of the engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exhibition area of 20 000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
We will not only be able to find motorcycles and classic cars, but we will also find articles from ClassicAuto Madrid of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collectible engine that will delight collectors and curious people.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in the sale of automobiles, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and catering of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this show will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Actitude tests with classic automobiles and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop : A sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda intends to prove that sportsmanship is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horsepower gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastener.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That’s why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre and 150-hp gasoline engine with manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real joy. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its services and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most in-demand Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not make a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sporting Party, in other words the one that has the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Track Change Assistant (RVM) that removes blind spot, traction and stability controls, cruise control, photosensitive interior mirror, large-sized on-board computer, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1 500 euros, includes among other elements of the adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not work many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the model tested, the Sportive.
In return for this significant amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
"First" luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos : Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as it was used to, had opted for a dark “lady”.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility even of seeing some type of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five-minute glory in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone’s data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as his American older brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when you cross a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection of Fon) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of a fixed-priced roaming is incredibly seductive and it has been going to work for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I’m concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated calls to order of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of your home country, you are reluctant to use the data, and you are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And this is what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it’s a more accurate formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is, no doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the taking of office of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose, in fact, the same to accompany her in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of her life: the award to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with brilliant reflections, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So much so that at a glance, it would seem that the First Lady of the United States follows the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put the same outfits back.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, it wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised while she wore them released the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study “Fecundity and professional career of women in Spain”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of life in a couple and the number of children, whether or not the woman is working and the type of job being held.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have unstable work, get into a relationship earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a relationship. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with stable jobs needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to push back the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences motherhood, but less the date of the beginning of a common life,” explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, those who completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with medium- or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also well worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand’s products, singing the universal motto “Because I’m worth it”.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L’Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In the man’s category, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in Lost).
Prices of British fashion
The British have much to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, from past and present, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's ace poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "x-rays" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He does not do it according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither the fears nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and proofreadings.

A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a melee blood, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying word, they kicked her two shots that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is fun to attack for free a small helpless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumen that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been moaning all day.
We have of course filed a complaint at the police station of the district even if we doubt that it is very useful and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to young people so that they find it fun to mistreat for free a helpless animal that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by both structures.
The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products” and said it contributed to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet in two wheels, under the motto “To be or not to be”, will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to guarantee the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sale of light commercial vehicles is increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to figures from the employers’ union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the benchmark for comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add up all the vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, we must add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has served little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was recalled again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealer association forecasts a year 2010 similar to that which is coming to an end, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As has taken place with the ABS anti-lock system and as will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen pedestrian protection, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to pull the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken full advantage of their strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four claims with injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that it will need more time to conclude the Opel backup plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved beforehand by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper’s candidacy, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it from nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the scale at only 1 275 kilos.
This led them to do without, first of all, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual sheeted roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of gains, to mount sports tickets, still 12 kilos, and with
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the handles of the doors with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly twisted turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with plumb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we have tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in corners, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's all we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of motor at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the “sport” option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at a standstill or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we covered with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed the potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely made an act of presence on the whole journey, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
An intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house’s fashion shows, the singer displays her face as bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or an “It Girl”, it’s a “Bag Girl”.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during his visit to the hard field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is thus at the top of her group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of her team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team has been able to fill the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and red, who took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of Vitoria’s team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but the Alava team chose Barac’s inner play and Eliyahu’s work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter’s “minus six” evaluation already suggested that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria that we do not win so easily on their pitch, and thanks to “the hand of Elias”, they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the yellows taking the advantage over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic’s players, injured but far from dead, needed to follow up with some skillful actions to get some fresh air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic’s machine gun appeared, which, with three baskets with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas put the counter back to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter
Avala’s team went out to play it all for the whole thing in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not tire anyone take what they had earned for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic’s players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came closer at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The wounds prevent the Unicaja from fighting battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), who facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion or by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
The game of the first quarter, made it possible to make the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point baskets, two from leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the 12-18 local team in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team’s arsenal with the inner play of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, helped topple the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both sides, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The interior players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, widened the 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible rise
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos which, despite the 19 losses, was superior and even managed to match the difference of the match played at Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group stumble.
The Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the game.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook’s three-point baskets, and Lewis’s support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players were pressurizing and showing their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you get paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified real estate, job and vehicle ads in Spain.
The tool “How much should you get paid?” calculates the salaries of users from more than 140 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week that the application has been operating, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels poorly paid,” Trovit’s product manager, Albert Ribera, said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45 226 euros gross annual and one French, 31 059, while a Spanish receives 24 000 euros.
Similarly, a driver collects 34 247 euros gross annual in England, 25 751 in France and 16 420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of server, with 11 592 euros net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his Tegucigalpa embassy.
The overtherbranced president will have to abandon diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, a business officer at the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former proxy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, in the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant rating in the markets, uncertainty arose again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the cogs, as the ECB did, with their auction a year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and the public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, provoking an increase in differences between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain was barely hit by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the advocates of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, when what would have to be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is like a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place to power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot with roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country not to meet its commitments.
What, on the other hand, makes sense is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves facing an episode of normalization of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gaps increase commensurate with European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If the European gaps diminished and ours continued to rise, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators require most study services to anticipate their recovery models and revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are back on the charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment “caution is a mother of safety”.
Connected sectors
Iberdrola’s president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, eight-closed.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros until 2020 and 60 000 million more between this date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants today in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question changes, and we will have to increase the power.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW more are needed, along with other “support energies”.
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is asking for, has not wanted to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to fight global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “punctual” measures, as the president of Iberdrola has described them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must start to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable paying framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for the services of goods, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes in its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The project at stake is an estimated tunnel of 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The city council wants to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public / private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Ernst & Young, the local administration already has a list of the finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase compete with three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish smooth company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the leading European underground works specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is based, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that passed the event is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major projects and privatizations, but entering it is a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains yet an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just conquered a place in this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is focusing on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier business and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the business combination responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll underground track, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the said Northern Link, is set to connect the western Toowong Highway to the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll track will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two-tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will bring 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work to Hochtief
Australia continues to grow Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned getting a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband fibre-optic network.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have quick access to the Internet and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the project to build the 27-story King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to 64.5 million euros.
The company was awarded this contract a few days after being in charge of the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the project is scheduled for early 2010 and its realization will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the Sra agency. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that came to the Tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has fined France Telecom 63 million euros for its anti-competitive conduct in the country-owned Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned enterprise, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts on its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has also been increased because the authority that watches over the competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar infringements in the past and that it is therefore repeat offender.
An application store
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from the transmission of voices.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barca since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have earned 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn’t just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, having won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
Top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, though they lost in front of Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money brought in by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1 090 million thanks to the Champions League.
From this sum, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800 000 euros) and a tie (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth finals receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive in the quarter-finals receive3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, to which are spent 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four designated places.
The previous year’s champion pockets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played during the current year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday listed the details of the offer to buy shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require him to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares ended at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa’s offer therefore estimates the company 18 % below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers to purchase and judicial back and forth from her former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold an executive position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will directly depend on the group chair.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains overwhelmed in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new embezzlement cannot be ruled out.
Regarding credit to the Salazars, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes the PATernina exclusion takeover bid presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion takeover bid presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The oversight body explained that it authorized this transaction because it understood that its terms were adjusting to the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory slip submitted “sufficient” as a result of the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV clarified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, composed of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares were fixed, and that they could not be transmitted in any way before the finalization of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the most recent IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service and service providers for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information from manufacturers, and then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and write its price.
In addition, we establish a “smart” graphic image of each model on which we can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it’s a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have for example information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres spread across the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in some brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or for calculating the market or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution, for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool can be bought according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it has left the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful to identify trends, perform geo-demographic analyses or know common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific brand have gone to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer’s official parts, prices and time.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of cars, breakdowns or maintenance.
The Evaluation WG Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it has made a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
Earlier last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its turnover is realized in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33 000 garages, of which 3 000 are in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera group was listed on the stock exchange 1 000 million dollars, today its shares are valued at a total of 2 400 million dollars.
Since 2007, it has been side on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auctions of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breaks and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3 000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-recorded, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage quote in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential part of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passengers, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables like labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then they can print the quote to give it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include the estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the internal face.
