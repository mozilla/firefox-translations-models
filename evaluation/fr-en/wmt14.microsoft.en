NSA case highlights complete lack of intelligence debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is publicly offended by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran√ßois Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance of all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the wiretapping of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of American power, this constitutes an important insight.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be indignant about this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did the France benefit from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The implementation for roughly ten years of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by the France, has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, the France and the United States in particular have set up procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on an almost daily basis and which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the NSA's resources.
The France may be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services, and, in return - as has already been quickly said - the Americans can give information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the fundamental question behind this NSA affair is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that should be theirs, and, ultimately,  the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the real risk for the United States? a degradation of their image?
No matter how much we denounce them, I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans may be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have become strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American service providers subject to American laws, and therefore to the control of the NSA.
Finally, the vast movement of revelations initiated by media around the world, which contributes to triggering a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services hitherto almost non-existent, could push legislators, including American ones, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of an outbreak of violence
The US president was to receive Friday, November 1, 2013 Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced in October its deadliest month in five and a half years, according to figures published Friday, November 1 by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher toll with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence has become increasingly deadly despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by the Shia-dominated government of Nuri al-Maliki.
The total death toll in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new conflagration as neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the street or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complain of being politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests, has contributed to this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, fresh violence killed four people in northern Iraq, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of bombings, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), an Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremist) affiliate also involved in Syria's civil war.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of talks in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on a promise to end military involvement in that country, painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite, attributing to him the partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian politics".
They also demanded that Barack Obama impress upon Nuri al-Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
French police will arrest Anderlecht fans who come other than with RSCA buses
French police have decided to lay down strict rules regarding the match of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set for Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Brussels-Midi police zone, on Friday.
Belgian RSCA fans who want to go to this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even police custody," Verbeke said.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishops' conference, with instructions to get as many responses as possible.
The information will be used for a major gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to survey parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Surrey's Gabrielle Roy School faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was charged with hostage-taking, forcible confinement, uttering threats, carrying a weapon for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The swift reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to de-escalate the situation immediately were critical to the safe conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan remains in custody and will appear in court on Friday.
New nicotine vaccine could suppress smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing is needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said early signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all methods now available on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting their nicotine fix.
In the tests, vaccinated mice that were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were soothed," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have been shown to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently to keep antibody levels high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is expected to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them break their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but pointed out that much more research was needed.
Egyptian Islamists take to the streets to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is brewing in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the start of the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, stresses this militant of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
This is not a trial, it is a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial, protests a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to put Sisi on trial, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced Thursday, October 31, that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while the France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," says the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on skin injured by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 am and 6 pm from November 1.
"As the France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother were imported from another country, not free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last "autochthonous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "the France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a fatal disease if not treated in time," the ministries remind and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the appearance of the first symptoms of the disease.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The ecotax gantry of Pont-de-Buis, around which took place Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finist√®re on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the gantry.
This is the last of three ecotax gantries in working order in the department of Finist√®re, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Australian woman appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of making false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were restraining her, assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in a cell at the local police station prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Office to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" for her daughter's wellbeing and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We obviously had an agonizing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on holiday in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand may also seek to burnish its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are facing lawsuits over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of old Nortel patents, began an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against cellphone makers, including Google, the company it topped at the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. Criminal Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising related to search terms on the Internet, the lawsuit said, which is Google's core business.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $ 4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market based in part on Motorola's patent library.
"Despite failing in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the said patents," the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking greater damages from Google because it claims Google's patent infringement is stubborn, according to the plaintiff.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a caf√©, after they expired in August 2005 without a tender.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, following testimony by Mr Tripodi's former deputy secretary-general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government lobbied for leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which brought in approximately $2.5 million per year to the Obeids, were renewed without a competitive bidding process.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tendering.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, was calling for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations submitted to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we discussed but in any case, it wasn't about that.
At least certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their cell phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronics to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music ‚Äî but not talk on their cell phones ‚Äî under the long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn't expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be compliant.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the plan, we may approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them back on until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their devices when the plane descends before landing and not turn them back on until the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with the changes.
"Once the new policy is safely implemented ‚Äî and we will be working closely with carriers to do that ‚Äî it will benefit everyone," Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly kicked out of an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the plane was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will still need to be stowed away as they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory authority for cell phones rests with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know from the FCC that they could disrupt cell towers if used on board," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the problem recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
The new airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of electronic devices.
In 2011, company executives loaded an airliner with Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has left FAA advisory committee members with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the aircraft poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that the aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to instruct passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for tech-equipped travelers.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US move to relax regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight as long as they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it distressing not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on airplanes," she said.
The issue is regulated by requiring aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has previously spoken to CASA about plans to expand use of its in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it was currently complying with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change that," she said.
The FAA's decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will closely review the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
"Once an airline has verified its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stowed under seats or in overhead compartments during take-off and landing.
CDC Releases Childhood Allergy Tips for Schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines the U.S. government has released, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has soared sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine ‚Äì the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used ‚Äì so they can react quickly in the event of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I feel like something is biting my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue," or "I have tingling on my tongue."
Much Opposition to Medical Assistance in Dying at Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Conference on Hospice Palliative Care, taking place this week in Ottawa, comes days after the vote in principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus were on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If it is adopted, Alberte D√©ry is worried about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of hospices will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice-president of the Hospice Alliance.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked: "I want to die, give me an injection".
Rick Firth, director of the Ontario Hospice Palliative Care Association, believes the Quebec bill confuses people about what palliative care is all about.
He doesn't believe Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, St√©phanie Vall√©e, says that the notion of end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is adopted.
Halloween 2013: By the numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late, and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more stingy.
In the last two years, I haven't handed out a single candy and I certainly won't do it again this year.
But the stats show that I'm the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans ‚Äî 158 million of them in fact ‚Äî will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party are trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; They can also be sexy foods like pizza, burgers, and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet Daft Punk's spacemen will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't gland.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That's great news for the 41 million kids who go candy hunting in their neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy and, let's not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and that includes those great pictures of you pissing on yourself that your friends put on Facebook that you can't remove and have a guy you like leave a comment like "pretty head."
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin into the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree ‚Äì it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "pumpkin baby trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved those pumpkins and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that wilt gently on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and try carving their 922kg pumpkin.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Commission scolaire de la R√©gion-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has required a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes made in the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," says Ms. Lef√®vre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for more time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," says Ms. Lef√®vre.
The Commission scolaire de la R√©gion-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) declined to comment.

DRC: army attacks rebels' last stronghold
The diehard M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," told AFP a resident of Jomba, reached by phone around 12:30 p.m., and according to which a girl was wounded by a bullet in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a little."
According to this witness, who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "sweep operation".
Crackling sounds of small arms could be heard loud and clear behind him.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the UN Stabilization Mission in the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with the FARDC having "surrounded the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since Friday's resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not been directly involved in the fighting, but has been providing key intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
By late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were heading up to the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck to relieve another device pounding M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday night again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" or risk being disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been talking since December without result so far.
There, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it remains only for the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born out of a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the movement of return to the DRC that had begun in the morning was reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed again to go to our fields, but the soldiers told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
One gets the impression that the shots are getting closer to the people.
In the early evening, dozens of residents were crossing the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire on Thursday killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health sources said.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army was content to evoke a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug on the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Concern over security in Mozambique grows as conflicts erupt between powerful figures
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, as they were toss, thousands gathered in central Maputo to chant peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to return; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt with the words "We want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were reports almost daily of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not slide back into open conflict, but recent events have rattled foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are high for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the United States' Anadarko.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Assaults on former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace deal.
He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had previously said it would boycott municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war chest from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been falling steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former Renamo member, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mazanga said Guebuza ‚Äì who is expected to step down at the end of his second term next year ‚Äì wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive blitzes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo but where Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal, is located.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that those responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems," he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads," he added.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gathering of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a brawl involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four people were reported to have suffered minor injuries.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who worked with youth in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches of his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
Timberlay Baptist Church, where the pastor officiated, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released on conditions.
In particular, they must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in Halifax Provincial Court in December.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was in a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "lovely special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently plant outside his door," but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people's homes hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three means to investigate the topics: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say, "Of course it is."
Rumours of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which voice messages were recorded hacked on his phone on at least three occasions, was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that involved Ms. Pawlby and her sister stored in a "Projects" folder.
During the time the detective was investigating her, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about her, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voicemail he left her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we're planning to publish tomorrow that I'd really like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking phones.
$325 million bailout package for Tasmania's health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the faltering health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to end a crisis caused by the island nation's aging population, high rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding, planned over 4 years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for elective surgeries.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help catch up.
Funding is also provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better outpatient care, executive training, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that frontline clinicians believe this is the best way to care for Tasmania's health system," said Plibersek.
The Minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The Crown will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the Crown delivers services in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless it is followed by genuine reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system."
He nevertheless commended the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance it presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid package will go a long way toward removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health critic Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "makeshift solution."
"The reason we're here is because the state's Labor government has taken $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.
You cannot have a state government that snatches almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretend that it is a good day.
Mr Dutton visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
He walks through mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon's villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Hero of the Year."
This person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle watched his ailing father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaound√©, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he would carry the after-effects for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get whatever treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., rush to the hospital to be first, and you're not first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health spending is in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to make a difference.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgeries free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaound√© Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they cram into vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need help the most.
Luck does not always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles across rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community throws a party, sings and dances and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle ‚Äì with his big smile and boundless energy ‚Äì is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to see hundreds of patients.
"We get 500 people every visit," Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this mobile hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate ‚Äì a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, a town hall or a house; After the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to make way for the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a gruelling pace, but the village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
"They bang drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgeries for free over the past year, and they know their presence can make all the difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It's going to change my future and my family's future," the man said.
In addition to supporting this mobile hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical practices around Yaound√©.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so that he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his assignments, it's a hands-on learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help mop up the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
It's not something you get to do in America when you're a second-year medical student.
Student volunteers usually pay for their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaound√©, their pension, transport and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt about it," O'Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to die.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons I do this.

Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include enhanced brakes, access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Bowler Motorsport chief executive Drew Bowler said: "Rally fans joining Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that it will be a new way to try different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle ‚Äì the championship is going to be really exciting. ¬ª
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The two France of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in lecture halls and classrooms?
No doubt, but emphasizing his weakness for the side roads, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise?
Certainly, but knowing that such a coronation cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which it has done without.
They readily recognized in him a great awakener, animator and unifier of their work, but pointed out that he was reluctant to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues could see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a keen eye and weighted with erudition, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had written a lot and well.
This book should definitely do it justice.
Yet we find, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual wandering, jubilation put to jump as if with both feet from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the second-hand dealer back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constituent knot of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: this is a concern of the time.
Recently, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the affair, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is tracking is quite different.
He does not pose as heir to an eternal Frenchness, he refuses to define it.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the shape of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Including this one, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its borders, so formerly structured and solidly bricked, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to ward off the trouble born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits the national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; Anxious, on the contrary, to rediscover its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility because it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invinciblely binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing beats the four steps outside France, so that Pierre Nora's American escapade could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France both made a revolution, wrote a bill of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American cousinship only better emphasizes what is unique to us.
There, men who had left their Ancien R√©gime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men encumbered by an indigenous Ancien R√©gime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it sowed drama and confit.
There are founding fathers always honored, and here revolutionary ancestors of whom it is difficult to make models, and who have moreover killed each other.
There an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to make up for and attempts to resume.
The France that is leaving, the France that is coming
Yet there was a time when the French believed they could stitch together the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in the old France obscurely prepared the modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity had only a time.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of protesting minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of the France that is leaving and the circumspect sketch of the France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve some surprises.
We discover that the patheau was a homebody.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge prowler stood in the center of the center.
And the one who had submitted, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, grano salis, that he will have finally done it.
Certainly in a less stiff, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But make no mistake, which is just as restrictive.
Because much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to type to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy CEO of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a world as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 and France alone, the National Commission for Informatics and Liberties authorized 774 systems for recognizing fingerprints, hand shape or venous network in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime," said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism in some and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contour and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presupposes a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of sensors and the computing capacity of computers needed to analyze data, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, head of Accenture's R&D labs in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we're researching voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but you need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and tamper-proof marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they say they are).
Until now, identification has concerned the issuance of identity documents: it is necessary to compare biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that someone is not attempting to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We retrieve the images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassif, NEC France's business development manager for biometric identification solutions.
Another use is to take a picture of a person queuing up in a store, track its progress with facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, attendance control has been added.
"A biometric time clock avoids the phenomenon of the buddy pointing for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain ATMs by inserting your card and putting your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the typing of the secret code.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoul√™me by Natural Security in partnership with banks and supermarket chains: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but enters his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French retailers.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays at the checkout thirty seconds less, it's appreciable," explains the manager of a supermarket.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which crashes if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts continue to be concerned.
"The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers who carry carry-on baggage on its flights up to $100.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in its announcement Wednesday it said passengers could take the unopened can with them when they get off the plane.
The new carry-on baggage fee is for bags stored in the overhead bin, so small bags installed under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was intended to encourage travelers to pay the fee in advance.
"We don't want to make that price pay," she said.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much as they could in the carry-on luggage stored in the overhead compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
This fee is a way to ensure that passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee won't really be used to raise money.
It's about making Frontier's most loyal customers understand that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find space in higher compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger standing in line at a Frontier gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure passengers know about these fees before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's carry-on baggage fees won't be applied until the summer, though no date has been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them did not touch baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first carry-on baggage fees three years ago, and low-cost carrier Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company charging such fees is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharge.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's carry-on baggage fees brought in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when passengers discovered the company's unusual carry-on baggage fees.
"I had never seen such a smooth boarding process in my entire professional career," he says.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passengers boarded at lightning speed."
Frontier also does like Spirit and applies a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 but backtracked seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.
Frontier's decision to charge carry-on baggage fees when passengers don't buy their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to entice customers to visit its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half of the loyalty miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is declining and it is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flying capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to turn Frontier's finances around by selling the airline.
Scientists have just shed light on how a dog's tail movements are related to its mood.
Previous studies have found that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wag their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Everyone knows that, in humans, the left and right side of the brain are involved in different ways in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to see what happened in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain is responsible for moving to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to other dogs' disordered tail movements, the researchers tracked animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals' heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It surely won't be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We showed dogs films featuring other dogs ‚Äì either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors ‚Äì and we were able to tamper with the movement of the tail and present it as going further left or right."
When the animals saw an expressionless dog wagging its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deviating mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks dogs know from experience what movements they should or shouldn't worry about.
He added: "If you repeatedly encounter other dogs and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side results in a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience."
The researchers say the findings could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their pets' emotions.
Canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Science, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs go more easily to a robot dog when its tail waggs to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious ‚Äì the opposite of what is in the Italian study."
He said the differences may be because the dogs that participated in the different studies did not entirely consider the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
"While there are many elements found in different mammals that indicate that the two sides of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified ‚Äî and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it surely won't be long before we understand why their tails sometimes move to one side and sometimes to the other.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's connected glasses.
They can acquire an earphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $ 50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earpiece.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with corrective lenses, no date for large-scale release has yet been confirmed.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what prompted a consultation a year ago with parents, students, teachers and education staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students who straddle several cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
Vision diversit√© has been touring schools for the past year to help students of all origins discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are native or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify with all this," explains Vision Diversit√© president A√Øda Kamar.
Michel Venne of the Institut du Nouveau Monde identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board has created a research centre that will give tools to professors who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the Universit√© de Montr√©al will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a classroom in a North American and Quebec context.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that's the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
Obama ends wiretapping of IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop wiretapping on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a US official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain control in the NSA eavesdropping affair after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal has been mentioned.
Asked about the matter, a US administration official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not say whether such surveillance had been in place in the past.
Another official said Obama had given orders to stop the practice in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the wiretapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved tighter controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission introduced new restrictions on the data intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
European stock markets down at mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock markets are trading lower Friday at mid-session, weighed down by some disappointing news from companies, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could unwind its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro zone as a whole, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures point to an opening of US equities higher, after two consecutive sessions of decline.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline in the CAC 40, weighed down by the profit warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing lower results this morning and announcing the creation of an internal bad bank with 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 gains in reaction to a press report that AT&T is studying a possible takeover.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is rife, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always been on inflation, so Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We expect a strong downside potential for the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to decline against the US currency and touched a two-week low of $1.3517 in session.
Conversely, these same conjectures support the eurozone bond market.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in this state and largely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five sketches imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, vignettes with a strong dose of humor, we allow teenagers to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Soci√©t√© d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Destinations lyriques, a formula that is now sold out at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Ap√©ro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of coloratura soprano Marie-√àve Munger.
It was a fundraising activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and she helped the non-profit organization produce a balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as a tune from The Bat.
Without giving precise figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions, the future is bright, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a milestone we will reach in seven years," commented the administrator.
"I would even say beyond," added the general manager, H√©l√®ne Gaudreault, smiling.
Congolese army hunts M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units will hunt down M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of defeat after being driven out of the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the insurgency began 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and corner it wherever it is hiding because they are criminals," FARDC spokesman Col. Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel's political leader, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills overlooking Bunagana, the latest insurgent-held town to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of MONUSCO peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the UN Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of manpower, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention brigade made up of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC general staff was reshuffled and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of advance of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," Congolese affairs expert Jason Stearns predicted on his blog Congo Siasa.
That would be historic ‚Äì it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, initially made up of mutinous former Congolese soldiers.
British Foreign Minister William Hague has urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military reprisals following shells falling on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, residents of Bunagana flooded the streets of the town to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to us that we would one day be liberated by the army," said a resident of this town bordering Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," the man added.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that U.S. spying "went too far inappropriately."
John Kerry signaled a softening of the U.S. defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs, admitting, in an unprecedented move, that on several occasions espionage "went too far inappropriately."
The secretary of state also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had governed on "autopilot" when a series of inflammatory revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic firestorm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Kerry said: "There's no denying that the President, I and other members of the administration learned about some things on autopilot because we had the opportunity, from World War II to the difficult years of the Cold War.  then of course on September 11. ¬ª
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels cheated.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they acted?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of counterterrorism organizations because of frustration over National Security Agency oversight.
"It's really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stand with us in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism," Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the U.S. Senate's European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to go to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA's programs.
The press reports that the NSA has picked up millions of communications in Europe, which has strained relations with some U.S. allies, however the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and a misunderstanding because it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations pointed to documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
Director of Intelligence James Clapper justified spying on allies as necessary and common practice on both sides.
In the tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating lawmakers are expected to be announced in the coming days.
He said the route had yet to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help improve relationships, but also to show "loving firmness."
He explained that European heads of state need to be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been running for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with resentment over U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Celtic Glasgow captain Scott Brown has had his appeal rejected and will be suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Sent off against Barca for hitting Neymar, the Scottish midfielder has seen his suspension extended to three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was fully justified.
For the CEO of Titan, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing in the towel with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tyre manufacturer Titan, now declares himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the plant's 1,137.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced Monday, October 21.
After abandoning the plan to buy the plant in January, you are back today.
You had made violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We do not understand this about-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except to my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the highest paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I'm sorry.
But the France has a high level of taxes and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a plant that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a fair price and skilled workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the plant closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance package, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed plant from Goodyear.
From then on, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agreed to recruit them from among Goodyear's approximately 1,200 current employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
From then on, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he would like a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the project to buy the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no more employees on site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least 2 people were injured.
They are believed to be an employee working for the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the perpetrator of the shootings.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or to the tarmac.
Soon the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care reform bill
A major victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared Obama's health care reform bill constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the justices validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ‚Äì which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a fine ‚Äì and declared it constitutional under the government's taxing power.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court's four most liberal members, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also upheld the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also found that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the threshold for eligibility for Medicaid must be lowered or all federal funding for the program will be lost, was constitutionally coercive.
The lawsuit to block the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primaries, including nominee Mitt Romney, vehemently opposed the law.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Room of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin began recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness from which she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she is "happy to be back".
Children should be taught myths and legends as "lifestyle models," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "brute force is no match for subtle cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too outrageous and in some cases far too obscene to be taught in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "openly didactic" makes children "completely drop out", with messages being "sublimated" into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
US green light for Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objections from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to creating the world's largest advertising agency.
The merger brings together the world's second largest agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe announced today the expiration of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups said in a statement.
They specify that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided by the HSR in the United States and the clearance decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
"The merger is also subject to obtaining further regulatory approvals and shareholder approval of both groups," they added.
New class action lawsuit against the Holy Cross Brothers
A new class action lawsuit has been filed against the Holy Cross brothers, concerning sexual assaults that allegedly took place this time at Saint Joseph's Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The motion is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumise, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at Saint Joseph's Oratory, where he was a Mass servant and where his father worked as a painter.
The first action concerned only three institutions, and when we announced the settlement, many people told us: "I was in such and such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both actions.
The class action lawsuit that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of plaintiffs from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first action, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of Holy Cross and Saint Joseph's Oratory, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exercised moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless covered it up", and that they "knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, √âmile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on archival research on the subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Brother of Holy Cross who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage, namely hearings on the merits, is proceeding.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Holy Cross had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
DRC: the army prepares a new assault
Children play on a charred tank that belonged to M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on its own.
Only Runyonyi Hill will remain.
"That of Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was retaken on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred diehards of the M23, are entrenched at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighboring town of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported fighting nearby Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the previous day and were buried.
A girl was shot and wounded and three other people were wounded, one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not reported any loss of life.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's stop and search program and removed her from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was stayed pending the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday relating to the stay request.
The appeals court said the judge should be removed from the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by falsely targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their stop and search program.
It appointed an external monitor to oversee changes, including policy, training and supervisory reform, and ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in neighbourhoods with the highest number of checks.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases are rejected after a police check.
The City's appeal is expected to be heard after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of stop and search has been criticized by many civil rights advocates.
This stop and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an all-time high in 2011 with 684,330 stops that involved mostly black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop and search program say they will end unfair practices, lead to more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say the changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that she was not ending stop and search practices, which are constitutional, but that she was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's national intelligence agency, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, insisted again in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal trade secrets from foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant-turned-whistleblower, began unveiling his endless treasure trove of information about U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to take the director's word for it.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have sparked corporate paranoia about state surveillance more than ever.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel's back.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.
I believe it is conceivable that this data could be used for their mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Gr√ºn, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultancy EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted trade secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capacity and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not the way to do it," says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations came as a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A big change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10% of non-U.S. members have given up on plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-head of SAP, says: "Our customers are asking us a question today that they didn't ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There always has been.
"This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, managing director of chemical producer BASF.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case it leaves the advantage to an adversary.
Big companies have long been hammering home the message that it's unwise, to say the least, to pick up a free USB drive from a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of automaker Audi, says collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so they can't be used as remote listening devices, has been common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of undermining the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, cited the France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of France's domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has tentatively quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne who, in Budget 2012, recorded a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than ¬£2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than as an individual.
Stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and amounts to ¬£708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, exceeding the total value of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on this matter, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
Luxury property ‚Äì the top 5-10% of the property market prices ‚Äì in the thriving south-west London area stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London are growing steadily year-on-year by 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills research.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal governments weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, automakers showed figures released Friday, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit's big three automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts had expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight brake is explained in the first place by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month".
GM nevertheless reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, against 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit among other things from the success of its pickups, saw its sales increase by 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, against 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted below-consensus sales, despite year-on-year gains of 8.8 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford gave up 1.1%.
Pamela Anderson cuts her iconic blonde curls and adopts a spectacular boyish cut.
Pamela's blonde curls became famous thanks to her role in the sexy TV series Malibu Alert.
Pamela Anderson is the latest celebrity to shock her fans with a spectacular new hairstyle.
The former pretty girl from Alert in Malibu dropped her long blonde hair against a platinum blonde boy cut.
The 46-year-old actress unveiled her new look as she walked through L.A. on Wednesday and shared a photo on her Twitter page.
This is the first time in 20 years that the pretty blonde has had her hair cut, and we are fans of discreet change.
What do you think of Pammy's hairstyle?

A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK government.
HS2 Ltd's work suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government raised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from ¬£32.7 billion to ¬£42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity building and journey time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our focus for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it's also about developing connectivity between Britain's 18 major cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
UK Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support the inclusion of Scotland in HS2.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic clout to the overall high-speed rail project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to partner with the UK Government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with UK ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps."
UN welcomes new targets to fight poverty
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to fight global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in putting forward the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that now was the time to "go beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process of setting universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child's gender, allowing them to list an "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to take the pressure off parents who could make hasty decisions about gender reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, and then wait and track the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law "seems like a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but most children do not," he added.
It is possible to do sex assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not linked to sex but rather to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics (such as muscle mass, body hair, chest and stature), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive and sexual organs), or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and bias-motivated crimes.
Young boys of non-conforming gender now have camps specifically for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to list male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be found "neutral" after winning her appeal that allows her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will feature a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition to have "gender theory" removed from textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new kingdom where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, two other pillars of civilization are being overturned."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also told Baby Zone that she would prefer to have babies assigned a gender when they are born.
"Being a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's gender," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community considered gender a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But now, many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about gender reassignment when they grow up.
"In the mid-twentieth century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, we did not call the psychiatrist, we phoned the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was pioneered by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He enshrined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues ‚Äì how parents raise a child ‚Äì interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape them to be identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories were controversial.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a botched circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Money framed this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors "always repeat this pattern."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex reassignment operations said "[that] they are not satisfied with the outcome."
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn't really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he underwent vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth ‚Äì and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a Sexual Development Disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing testosterone treatment and having his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an 'indeterminate' sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law will bring, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender," she added.
German law concerns the assignment of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should be fighting at this age.
As they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law will "empower" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a child psychiatry intern at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogates.
"The law gives parents some leeway so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a delay before writing "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine ‚Äì you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
"It puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide which gender he/she feels most comfortable with ‚Äì and that's a great thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a gun at Le Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 went door to door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The old man, aged 86, told the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His gun was seized.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts foiled by Republican Party obstructionism.
Obstructionism does not excuse Obamacare's difficulties, nor drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading an awfully sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me during the gloom of 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memoir from Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I've finished my patients' medical reports at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to the days when politicians inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory, and news anchors took time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My classmates cried tears of joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82 percent favorable views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years since I first voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our military from Iraq, to the end of "neither seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward on immigration reform, public health care, and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer explain.
I am on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives, nor does it indict whistleblowers who expose government misdeeds.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and exceeding authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And, more recently, she can't excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I've listed above seem to be largely the administration's choice.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected to a second term free from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had been hearing about for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me desire the many promises that have vanished.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
"I want us to refocus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Here we are 5 years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
La Nouvelle Star has made a strong comeback, in terms of audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% of audience share.
But was the show there?
Some 10,000 candidates showed up for the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perched Andr√© Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored during this first prime.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide choice of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
However, on Twitter, we want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few have found their account.
Many of them have tried the Nouvelle Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make people laugh.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two sources familiar with the matter, showing once again that regulators' global investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulation of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," a bank official said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter said RBS had forwarded files of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
That trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as head of European spot trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi's European head of spot FX trading, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher's file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources familiar with the matter said.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities ‚Äì the European Commission, Finma, Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ‚Äì are investigating allegations that bankers colluded to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks have been scouring instant messages and emails sent for years for cases of wrongdoing.
News about these investigations has rattled traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers for investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and banks' increasingly frequent use of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start making an impact on the market at little cost".
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange traded funds office this week after he caused a $6 million loss late last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter was brought under control," said a Credit Suisse representative.
Chinese newspaper that called for 'going to be overhauled'
A Chinese newspaper that has issued a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be revamped, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a "complete overhaul," the regulator said.
The "reshuffle" order emanates from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express' editorial staff was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
It also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the responsible persons at New Express and immediately reshuffle the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities by a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a state television station where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published its apology on its front page, writing that it had not properly checked its articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are routinely forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama yesterday reneged on his unambiguous and oft-repeated promise that "if you're happy with your health plan, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received termination notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that is right for them can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a buzz in the news" about terminations, President Obama urged Americans who receive these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better adapted health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
"You will come out a winner," he said.
The Administration has announced that it should come as no surprise that the 5% of the population who purchase their own insurance are forced to switch plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: You deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said during her testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed "miserably."
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone else," she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, when she thought her microphone was cut off, while addressing an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, about whether she should adhere to Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act hadn't voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now touts to millions of Americans.
The Coen brothers' tribute to folk
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unable to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac proves to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich trappings of Daisy Mulligan in "The Great Gatsby" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swear word spewed with a machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the week-long tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He reluctantly accepts replacements at short notice in the studios.
Without housing, he makes the rounds of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not careerist but honest, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and awards at Cannes, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York destined to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk, writes.
The film then takes on the appearance of a documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by unsold 33T inhabited by an old unpayable secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who runs through the film constantly: a beautiful ginger cat with a cracking look, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get stuck by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported Friday a decline in quarterly profit due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net income fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters on average expected earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures have increased by seven billion dollars in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities edged down in the third quarter, while profits from downstream operations (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a decline in net profit on Thursday, despite the increase in its oil and gas production.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, agent and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the tragedy said they responded to a call reporting "multiple injuries".
"The police are on site," the airport said on its Twitter account, while television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC branch showed one person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at the airport's Terminal 3, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that Tables 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was not immediately able to confirm whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
NSA spying: US 'went too far,' Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in terms of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first admission of Washington in the midst of controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede to you, as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that does not happen again in the future," John Kerry said at a conference in London that he participated from Washington Thursday, October 31 by video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy justified at length the practices of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention against possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since foiled many plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have in fact prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects in advance," argued the head of American diplomacy.
And, John Kerry told the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," admitted the secretary of state, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "committed to trying to clarify and that he is reviewing these practices so that no one feels cheated."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting the data of hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program called "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by the Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, have revealed that the NSA would have massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and its leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such wiretapping, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, citing national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even passed the buck to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not target Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread Friday to Asia.
Indonesia has summoned Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also drawn the ire of China.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards precocious puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a child endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new normal.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents ‚Äî in general, it doesn't indicate a rapid progression to full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, up from 12 three-quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest starts to grow, it takes at least two or three years before the first period appears," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is some debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops ‚Äì this is something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small stature in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges that "controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to menstruate.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they're going to handle hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public attention about the causes of precocious puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Both boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years that links the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than young white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of precocious puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and pubic areas at younger ages, the trend toward true precocious puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk with their child.
"It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls with precocious puberty need to be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
A driver travelling at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was finned ¬£1,000
A motorist was fined ¬£1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the takeaway drink between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrates' Court, Howie admitted the driving offence without due care and attention.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of ¬£90 and a victim surcharge of ¬£100.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hostages of the World", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the possibility for hostages to file complaints and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Held for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc F√©ret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Gr√¢ce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been reunited with their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hostages of the world".
From the evening of your release, you were on the set of the 20h of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
On the spot in particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because it is dark - Roger Auque.
He tells me "we are free", but I am not sure, and tells me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense too.
This is war, and those who are driving us are also very tense.
They drop us off on the curb.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
French people take us to the embassy in France.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the embassy in France.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We land at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's a bit brutal.
There is an incredible stampede.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I come back and there are plenty.
The descent of the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers shoot each other to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent some from getting in.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we are in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and we are suddenly in the media spotlight.
It's a bit complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The same evening, I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like a vacation.
How were the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I had a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gr√¢ce the days following my return: X-rays, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not left to ourselves.
That is part of the process.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what is being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less so.
I try to distinguish between questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association "Hostages of the world" which allows me to put distance, and seems to me much more interesting to address.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a problem of semantics.
Hostage-taking must be described as "political" hostage-taking - which is most of the time - and hostage-taking must be allowed access to justice, complaints and the taking of hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that perhaps these hostages could also have access to justice?
A tribunal in The Hague is made for that.
Why should we not tell the hostage-takers "you have flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
Yet it seems to me to be well-founded, legitimate, and common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hy√®res
The sixth edition of Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hy√®res.
Organized by the SK8 Unity chapter of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will begin immediately, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled for 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy from Hy√©rois Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already conquered his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he loves nothing more than to show it to competitors who are three heads ahead of him.
The Wolf of Wall Street: release of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets slip some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will blow your hair out in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island stockbroker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street".
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort then mounts a scam that will make him a rich man, very rich.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have rediscovered the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the film finally lasts 2h45.
In theaters on December 25, he will be able to participate narrowly in the Oscar race.
The London Stock Exchange closed lower on Thursday, weighed down by the poor results of Shell and the day after an announcement by the Fed to maintain its support for the economy, as expected.
In La Seyne, rehousing due to rats turns into controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the office Terres du Sud Habitat, proposed, exceptionally and temporarily, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Jo√´l Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The pest control company carries out two passages per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not abound in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, pest control products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, you are not going to kill a kid.
"We did not invite the rats to our home," defends the father of the family who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon penniless and we are waiting for a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank with 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the riskiest assets, a measure intended to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of impaired assets on its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also said it would record an additional allowance for impairment of bad loans of four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter, an entry related to the constitution of the ring-fencing structure.
RBS also said the internal restructuring would free up ¬£10 billion to ¬£11 billion of capital, strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line under the past, the government having been accused in particular of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, look ahead to the future and the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for customers and for the UK," new chief executive Ross McEwan told reporters.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU member states spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
So this is a story that is not a story.
And a story so old that it's now frozen: I first heard the gossip that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposing the EU or pushing for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and came out of nowhere, garnered almost five million votes in September's federal elections and took the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket weighing on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits ‚Äì this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has imposed on its members exchange rates favourable to German exporters ‚Äì something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-√†-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make deep cuts in wages and public spending ‚Äì encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper productivity malaise in Europe.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels ‚Äì which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer ‚Äì European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a crippling disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen at Grangemouth.
All wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is brewing, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the ailing French economy to struggle.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote ‚Äì a timely warning to Britain's Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity with the white French working class?
She wants to use next year's European elections to create an anti-single-currency, anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, anti-European and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the free "Europe of (sovereign) nations" favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the U.K. to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will make the U.S. look soft.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could live with a freer European agreement provided that we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and retain our economic independence.
Scotland's SNP government is ‚Äì and noteworthy ‚Äì the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A house in flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 H√©bert Street.
The flames broke out in a three-unit house spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the S√©minaire de Qu√©bec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the arrival of firefighters, who were numerous to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw visible smoke.
"So the alarms followed one another, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec City firefighters.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over the Colombian capital Bogot√° on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a suit equipped with wings), he passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many onlookers had gathered to observe his feat.
End of service for the chef of the Elys√©e
Entering the 500 m2 of Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the ladders until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran√ßois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation spots, and fed countless world greats in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60.
The man with the open face, balding head and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in La Fert√©-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP in pastry.
His mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I went from one castle to another!" jokes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he has officiated, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysee!
No offense to heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all greedy," denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for Fran√ßois Hollande, who restored cheese, "he is someone who likes to eat" and "there is not much he does not like".
The current head of state, who has regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific diet".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysee: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand if there were mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysee, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart. Fran√ßois Hollande came to greet me."
He spoke praise.
"His human side came out," he says.
The chef will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysee for seventeen years.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudi√®re.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist traveling northbound in Saint-F√©lix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction.
All four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but their lives were not feared.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6 a.m. Friday.
Investigation into Mayor Rob Ford was botched, lawyer says
After police confirmed they had found a copy of the video that allegedly showed Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine, Clayton Ruby said he had never seen such a botched investigation.
Ruby told The Canadian Press that police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents show.
Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Police Chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in person, could very well have stopped Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby's comments an "obvious and desperate attempt" to make a name for himself in a case that has nothing to do with him.
At a news conference Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to a criminal charge being laid against the mayor.
A fighter from Hamas' military wing was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza said.
According to these sources, these militants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they came under shelling from an Israeli tank.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday urged its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the American and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice," it said in a statement.
She considers "scandalous" the Washington Post's report that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating the international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first screening of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment had the room evacuated and notified the fire brigade of a suspicious odour.
About 70 people were discharged from the session.
The people were examined and a full reconnaissance of the room came to nothing.
Bad joke against a background of tear gas?
Or unintentional incident?
Still, the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything returned to normal.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers have rediscovered the pleasure of images.
On screen only.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which made two seriously injured Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, said Friday evening the deputy prosecutor of the King.
The expert dispatched to the scene by the prosecutor's office assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The vital prognosis of both victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and is badly burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his girlfriend, was at his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Li√®ge, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," said the mayor Jos√© Paulet, descended on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of Arches intervened.
The civil protection of Crisn√©e stabilized the two buildings.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. highway planners struggle to find the money to fix crumbling highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches to the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record all miles driven by a motorist and pass the information on to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and government planning offices to overhaul the outdated system of funding major U.S. highways.
The generally uninteresting sector of major route planning has suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you drive on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is appalled.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and concerned about privacy.
And while members of Congress can't agree on whether to continue, several states haven't waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they can move to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already loaded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly indispensable for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which expects the state to start recording miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans are not buying as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gas prices are high.
"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had trackers installed on 500 cars to test a pay-per-mile system.
"This is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long run," he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to urban Liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation's free market proponents also like the idea of charging drivers per mile.
"This is not just a tax rushing into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. secretaries of transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile route.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House Speaker killed the proposal, addressing concerns from rural lawmakers representing constituents who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are making progress on their own.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the nation's largest experiment.
These motorists will soon be paying the state mileage instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is attempting a trial on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in trucking in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently fitted their cars with a device, drivers were worried that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and that sort of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the ACLU Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices."
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of a handful of states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to enlist the help of a small California startup called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she is testing have appealed to major route planners because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more likely to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some states.
There are far cheaper ways and far less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a flat rate based on the average number of miles flown by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a charging scheme that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide "pay-per-drive" insurance and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," an urban planning document said.
However, some transportation planners are wondering if the whole pay-per-mile debate is just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"You don't have to have radical surgery when you just need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
UK police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could face extradition to Sweden following allegations of sex crimes, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, seeking political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard has "issued a surrender notice to a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station, on a date and time of his choosing," a spokesman said.
He continues to breach bail conditions.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the US where he could face charges of espionage, after leaking more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold out until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate's vote to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "firmly intended" to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
Italy's upper house of parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Council president convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2nd October last by his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's injunctions who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, endless administrative costs.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dollars squandered could be saved in order to allow taxation that is very respectful of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken away from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, there is no hesitation about the lavish expenses and maintenance of lame ducks: a loss-making cultural centre, a large subsidy to the Cit√© de l'√ânergie, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, let them be sold to private enterprise or demolished.
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties to accommodate a major industry that never came.
However, I give honourable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not up to the public level to invest in such companies, but to the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that Lac √† la P√™che and Lac des Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (major water consumers) and the great decline in population, water use has decreased significantly throughout the territory.
Without wanting to waste it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly relaxed.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a borrowing bylaw.
We have been managed for over 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for the most part and I do not believe that a sheep farmer does worse.
Worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A common foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred just as the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke," said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I disembarked and went to remove the large bricks that covered it.
You could only see part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Commission de la sant√© et de la s√©curit√© du travail was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
NSA blames "internal error" and not hackers for site outage
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that caused its public site to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claims that the outage was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can't access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site crash by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once-top-secret NSA, once dubbed the "No Such Agency," has found itself in the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at home and abroad ‚Äî part of the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by the disillusioned former NSA consultant.  Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused much speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Downtown now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, we met individually with employees to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," said Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations F√©lix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta comes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair in Tourism at UQAM's School of Management.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a seniors' residence.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be completed within two years.
Do you fancy a fluorescent ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first jellyfish fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's something amazing but we're still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2g of this stuff costs around ¬£200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to glow.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween time because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I have created because the luminescence of jellyfish is worth four times more than gold.
So each ball costs me about ¬£140.
But it tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental-gait company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream flavors such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation promises to be even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop invisible ice."
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to make it happen.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
One seriously injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring road
A road accident caused serious injuries on Friday morning around 5:30 am, on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A female driver's car was hit by a phantom driver, who unharmed her.
The ring road was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the site of the accident, while the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause much traffic jam because the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore have been diverted through this exit/entrance to the ring.
Child seriously injured at Disneyland Paris attraction
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident at an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His prognosis is no longer life-threatening but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It has been closed until further notice.
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany on US surveillance issue
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for US intelligence, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Str√∂bele met Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys asylum, on Thursday to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: "While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political speech with charges against which it is impossible to defend oneself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will make that possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have been strained by complaints that the NSA tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the lawmaker who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence, said if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," it should be taken advantage of.
Str√∂bele, a German Green MEP, posted a photo of himself with Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Str√∂bele said that, according to the former NSA consultant's lawyer, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "grave and sustained" campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials ‚Äì including in the United States ‚Äì have deemed the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be in the public interest.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific project manager at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but it does not particularly surprise me.
If in the past, species were described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
It is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology may call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two morphologically very close species have been distinguished thanks to genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this a major discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society has claimed?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had already been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or incidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a species more widely distributed on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility it has to recover from neighbouring stocks.
For the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species originated, its stock automatically became lower, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known.
We'd rather send robots to Mars than find out what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent searching for life on other planets than on marine research and it is high time that changed.
Clive Palmer alleges that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is contesting the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, used this argument to try to dismiss questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be scrapped.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a vested interest in whether or not she gets leave," Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of revamping the vote counting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can go in, enter your details into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has explored options for e-voting and has recently published a joint concept paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job "very seriously".
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for reward except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time," he added.
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see three-year-old Fenton Kirkland win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his debut, the toddler and his Shetland Toffee pony trotted through the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable ‚Äì who are the same size ‚Äì were praised for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, Rudry near Cardiff.
Running against men and women in elegant bowler hats, he wore his flat cap a little to the side in a casual way to parade his 2-year-old pony Toffee around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural dressage qualities unusual for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training with his Shetland pony every day ever since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee make a great duet."
They showed up against all odds, but both won the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were thrilled that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells said: "There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering for and applauding it."
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals ‚Äì he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens to take care of.
The way he started, he will surely soon participate in the Horse of the Year event ‚Äì and I'm sure he will put on a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to ride his pony."
They are a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between pony and trainer ‚Äì Fenton and Toffee have been the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really good.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers are receiving proper care for their return to civilian life and none are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers ‚Äì who do not meet the military's "universality of service" rule requiring personnel to be able to perform a variety of tasks ‚Äì to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for pension benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay an additional year in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who testified before a parliamentary committee last month that he was pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universality of service rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the military.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicates that of the 1218 medically released soldiers, 199 had not completed the length of service required for pension benefits.
Liberal veterans affairs critic Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for Corporal Hawkins' reinstatement, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Airstrike against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new raid by IDF aircraft on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under roughly the same circumstances as the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an unnamed US official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had made no secret of their irritation at Washington revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Life imprisonment for former Chinese vice-governor
A former vice governor of northeast China's Jilin province was sentenced Friday to life in prison for corruption.
Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving more than 19 million yuan in bribes, Chinese state media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice governor, who was also the chairman of the Bank of Jilin, a state-owned institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon poses a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
While the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the low-ranking officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting top state office.
But the government has shown no intention of reforming the anti-corruption system, for example by creating a body independent of the party.
Bombardier profit down as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual issues in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not provide flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial entry-into-service schedule until next September.
After the first flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
Results fell short of expectations and share prices fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday downgraded his rating from "outperform" to "sector performance" due to the stock market's low upside potential in the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are truly disappointed with the profit margin in the Transportation division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We expect Bombardier to receive new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft can catapult it into the lower end of a market currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
But firm orders for the CSeries aircraft have been modest so far at 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to validate the company's claims about fuel efficiency and the potential for savings of the new airliner.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will meet its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft enters commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to do a first flight and have an update period, and we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to take to the skies in the coming weeks, with the others to follow shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier has indicated that it is evaluating the entry-into-service schedule and will provide further information in the coming months.
"This slow flight testing ‚Äì while apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule ‚Äì reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015," said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues edged down from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said it delivered 45 planes in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft from 83.
The delay in the Aerospace division represented $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aerospace, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aerospace revenues fell 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, said revenue from the division rose nearly 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The Transportation division's backlog totalled $32.6 billion as at September 30, up slightly from December 31 of the previous year.
Margins in the Transportation division suffered from execution problems on a few large contracts.
Executives announced that further guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
The share price of Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board of directors, fell 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?" the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, chief executive of Capital Group ‚Äì owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court "will always be biased as it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media". The Standard said democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "suffered a blow" and slammed the bill as "draconian".
The bill's passage comes alongside a package of measures to bolster national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
Kenyan media angered the authorities by broadcasting CCTV footage in which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn following an outcry in the media.
Under the new bill, media outlets will be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "deregistered" or no longer eligible for official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to cripple most FM stations."
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "bustling blogosphere."
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Left to their own devices, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering."
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and restored their staggering tax-free salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month ‚Äì among the highest in the world.
Two speleologists aged 23 and 27 were missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, we learned Friday from the Sp√©l√©o secours de l'Is√®re.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one seasoned in practice and the other not, had gone underground Thursday around 9:30 pm to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We were then without news of them since, said the same source.
"The cavers should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Sp√©l√©o secours in charge of organizing the rescue.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the French caving rescue, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two cavers were located.
"It was another group of cavers who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphin√©.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chamb√©ry, were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They got lost in the network, retraced their steps while waiting for help, said the prefecture.
Recharged, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let us make no mistake.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only for suburbanites.
I chose a France card as my logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I am addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native town of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My No. 1 proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism," he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attach√©, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even if he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chev√©nement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
"I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my platform are attached to the left, but if people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too.
It is only to extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - available on the Internet - on many themes supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building caretaker...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene." For the municipal elections of 2014, this may be fair, he admits.
It is a problem of time and money.
The Parti de la banlieue should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven heads of lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the emails of support that I have received since yesterday do not all come from the suburbs," he said.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Wreaths were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The government is currently considering the possibility of introducing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it considers extending the crackdown.
The test, if adopted, would be applied under a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used for unqualified positions or as a backdoor way to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government discussion paper was unveiled today as Labor MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's discourse on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The sensational statements about 'foreigners going back to the end' and 'jobs for Australians first' are an unpleasant return to the days when unions were demanding a safe labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected ‚Äì and I wouldn't be surprised if some countries in the region saw this as an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out "whether the job offer is genuine in the case where the applicant is a personal relation or associate of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught 9-year-old son was on his way to Australia with him and found some solace since his father's death on Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Questioning abortion rights in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas has reinstated some restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that were blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in this state and largely challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The appeal court's ruling means that doctors who perform abortions will have to have an "admitting privilege" with local hospitals.
The admitting privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a caring member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of providing diagnosis or treatment.
Abortion advocates argue that the content of the law risks immediately closing a third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the law's coming into force that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott of Republic, who is running for governor, asked the appeals court to overturn the trial ruling that blocked enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
Oracle shareholders angered by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the company's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, third fortune in the world just crowned by the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Already last year, Ellison had suffered a negative vote on his compensation.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May because of the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
For the full fiscal year 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the share price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index, which gained 24% in the same period.
Tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have been negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
It specifies that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused fifty deaths.
The 22-year-old supermodel does not start her film career with the back door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play young Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama lists, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a forty-year-old addicted to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste for risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on glossy paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; Below, the lining.
From Bj√∂rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, via Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses to their limits, always for the better.
Stacy Martin has not finished talking about her.
It has been five years since my father faded from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I spoke of him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget him or rather I didn't know how I was going to continue to "date" him.
There is no recipe, no instructions for using it to pass the wall of the invisible and find your own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, placed on the bedside table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother passed away after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, tense on that hospital bed with crumpled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was an icy farewell centered around the meager glow of candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small diurnal or nocturnal apparitions, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought which believed itself in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied this person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I was again, full and whole.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out" it seems.
I have always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I was in pain...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, he inhabited my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no more, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? What would they have thought? What would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when this happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I woke up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and rejoicing that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happily sharing what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in telling this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year before, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
This shows the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor that I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and taking an interest in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a prestigious school, were not, in hindsight, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic as a child, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades ‚Äì before returning to France at independence.
The values she instilled in me are still there, so sometimes I think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and righteousness of mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes resting on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago now.
Died after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that goes off alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then, time eased the pain.
All that remained was lack, this unanswered emptiness, this need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looking at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that weigh down his eyes, the fine lines around the lips that cigarette hollow, the folds that mark the forehead on days of worry.
My mother has taken possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I look away.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the trough of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little affected.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the hindsight of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the path she had traced for us.
If a being has loved you very much, absence cannot tear it out of your heart and memories.
In a way, your loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or appreciated.
I couldn't attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a baby boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he will think.
I don't know if I have adopted his way of being or if I am simply like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, it is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It has been almost thirty years since my husband passed away at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense sorrow that then invaded me has of course subsided but he is still close to me.
Very often he "land" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answers me "I'm going down" but in a voice so real that I woke up with a start, anxious and I turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we have been happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a job of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
From horses in beef products
Horse meat has been detected in cans of beef products sold by two small British low-cost retailers, the food hygiene agency said today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal over horsemeat in ready meals erupted in Europe earlier this year, following tests in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products purporting to contain only beef.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was Iraq's deadliest month since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day that the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We are not telling the world to stand with us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not resolved, it will spread, and what happens in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? it is spreading.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the US Institute of Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held placards accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with aid.
Paris Saint-Germain will host Lorient on Friday without its trump card, Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club said in a statement.
PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco on goal difference, has released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of his left knee when he returned from selection earlier this month.
Mick Jagger says he never flirted with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing vocalist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He flirted with me when I was 18."
She added, "That was a long time ago, and he was very nice."
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies making any advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism," landed at number one on the charts this week.
Clash between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening, October 31, 2013, during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip's only power plant shut down on Friday (November 1st) after its fuel stocks ran out, the Palestinian enclave's energy authority said.
A local commander of the Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another senior member of Hamas' military wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shelling during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters inside the territory before withdrawing afterwards.
The clash lasted half an hour, witnesses said.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier into Khan Younis.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed responsibility for using tunnels to fight Israel, saying the aim was to kidnap Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terror attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device aimed at IDF forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terror tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
Separately, Israel struck a military air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday (October 31st).
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" it did not name, the Saudi-owned channel said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jabl√©, near Latakia on the Syrian coast.
This organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Disney bets on shelves to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its worldwide launch on the channels of the Disney group is not scheduled until 2014, details the press release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, aimed at children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the American West where she reigns order with a magic lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature to kids today," Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, said in the statement.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 have used a tablet or phone, and 72% of those under 8, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred rue de Retinne in Fl√©ron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fl√©ron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of emergency services, he died in this head-on collision.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the tradition of Halloween.
He and his wife last night handed out treats to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were canceled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the revellers have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy," adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's good-natured, it's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints' Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily News of Tahiti, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if we count three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Island Council voted unanimously in favor of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project had to be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize these 836,000 km2, provided however that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport at Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for the France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, neighboring Pitcairn.
Greece: two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party office
Two people were killed and another was seriously wounded Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle that passed in front of a headquarters of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not yet able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn members had maintained that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue in the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and cordoned off the neighborhood.
The incident comes weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in "a criminal organisation" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Parents of Georgian teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a rolled wrestling mat in his high school gymnasium, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found Jan. 11 trapped in a leaning mat standing behind the bleachers of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old's family disputes those findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff's findings.
"They think it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering up the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag and we returned it to them in a body bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson died of "positional asphyxiation."
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, Moore said.
"Several questions still need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that would warrant a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all CCTV footage that investigators had reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues about the circumstances of his death.
Ex-Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
M√ºller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever being traced, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, told Bild.
M√ºller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told the newspaper, based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would answer one of the great enigmas of the post-war period.
The German secret service, the BND, claimed that in the summer of 1949, M√ºller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally mistaken.
"As early as August 1945, M√ºller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He wore "a general's uniform".
"In the left inner pocket were his service record with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district council of Berlin's Mitte district stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity in bad taste.
"We are grossly trampling on the memory of the victims," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich M√ºller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who has never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "Final Solution" and had under his command Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath of office
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of inauguration, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the swearing-in of the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
At his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the court's 18 black-robed judges whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life ‚Äì absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been considered an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments for more than 84 years since its formation.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer on the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the job begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, addressing judges in the wood-paneled room where he was sworn in.
Morsi later visited Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood at attention.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony.
Upon arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand... " sung by thousands of people gathered in the large amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers from which the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, stripped him.
But by agreeing to take the formal oath before the Court, rather than Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by dramatic populist gestures.
Aircraft manufacturers squabble over seat width as big orders are at stake
The dispute is raging between major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the stage for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is over the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers ‚Äì who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to implement a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy classes, but its big US rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as planemakers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for record orders at the Nov. 17-21 event.
The way the seats are arranged at the rear of the aircraft ‚Äì in particular, will there be 9 or 10 seats abreast ‚Äì is critical to the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing says its refurbished "777X" will be able to seat 406 people in economy class seats larger than 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that? ".
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprops," said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer.
As eating habits change, people get fat, but seats on planes haven't changed drastically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average 40- to 49-year-old American increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average twenty-first century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the girth of the newly dubbed "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures regarding seat width and says it's not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and amenities.
He also says the study shows that the cabin experience doesn't just depend on seat width.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to do business," said Kent Craver, Boeing's chief passenger satisfaction officer.
They do not want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it's more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it's increasingly an issue that could affect their bottom line.
Behind the dispute lies a race to order aircraft worth an estimated $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the newest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim 20% higher seat efficiency in their latest long-haul twin-engine models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's announced performance depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is small compared to the configured aircraft with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this to be able to fit more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of passenger comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a business perspective, Airbus' proposal is driven by the 777 threat," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Sellers of aircraft that fly around the world even carry a meter with them to check competing configurations.
While boasting of offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major maker of large modern aircraft, experts say its appeal to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats is unlikely to succeed, but it could overshadow the wave of 777X sales.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in the France of the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never indulges in lust or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the audience.
The musical, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart rock opera, most attempts were entangled in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Mis√©rables carried the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch√¢telet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles like hit hits.
The first resumes, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the world premiere of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical shows like "1789", "Les amants de la Bastille" and small musicals like "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de com√©dies musicales" and lecturer at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.
How are French musicals evolving?
The supply has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a real story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump back fifteen years under the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora headlining.
Then, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Ch√¢telet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon variety musicals by adapting them into French.
Independent French producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects like "Rent," "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like on Broadway of singing, acting and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists touring from project to project.
In the United States, the birthplace of the musical, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
Jobs are numerous between regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway ...
The talent pool is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relation of France culture.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theater aimed at adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering handsome young men (often talented) headlining a musical show is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are cleverly run by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are eagerly awaited when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise is mounted in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all major France halls in the same form as in Paris.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended lower on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing data.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, damaging export stocks and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix gave up 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11 percent to 1,668 yen.
Ben Greenman: New York Comedy Festival Tenth Anniversary: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is where stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the audience, in a conversational tone.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Caroline Stand-Up Club, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows performed in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of the headliners emerged in Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes," an evening of comedy and music for veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional channels, such as presenting shows on smaller TV networks, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on a cable sitcom ("The League" on FXX's gleefully lascivious fantasy football theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation," but she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Kroll and Slate, along with other singularly voiced young comedians (the pessimistic surrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors for this year's festival will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but he went on to become an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at City Hall, in midtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He would tell me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down an alley between two buildings and think, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-by-3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of non-definable warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out undetected, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who authorities said worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard crossing equipped with railroad tracks that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and poison-gas-filled munitions, the international chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday, as heavy clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the country's civil war began nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day ahead of the
November 1 set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "render unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing poison gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of Syria-based activists, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, there were an estimated 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, an estimated 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were fighters from pro-government forces and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Another estimated 2,202 of the dead were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people have been forced to flee the country as a result of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers chemical weapons inspectors face as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid an ongoing civil war under tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was "now satisfied to have checked ‚Äì and seen destroyed ‚Äì all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling."
She added that "no further inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the latter two sites due to concerns about their safety, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme contained therein had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected".
It was unclear at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I salute the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the organization's director-general Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, who are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there was a loud explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA of New South Wales employees have been charged with child sexual abuse following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse hearing.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it "has never had to deal with a child sexual abuse issue within its organization."
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at the Caringbah Hall YMCA was convicted of sexually assaulting children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, pointing out, "External YMCA checks were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA was informed that it had received the second worst ratings out of four schools in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit carried out in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any breaches of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA has a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Staff members testified that they observed some shortcomings, including Lord being left alone with the children, keeping them in private, making them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had sought child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said she found the Caringbah YMCA's head of children's services, Jacqui Barnat, who mentored Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected staff reports that they were reluctant to report such misconduct to their supervisor.
Instead, he said their friendly relationship with Lord clouded their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his views to the YMCA of New South Wales board that the organisation's lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and council agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA executive director of children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said the decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but was "overzealous" and had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-safe organisation when Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone told the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, monitoring, initiating, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The P√®re Lachaise crematorium organizes, at 11 am, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for mayor of Paris must attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals for funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, only 15% choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasure of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Fr√©d√©rique Bacqu√©, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Taming Death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
For Fran√ßois Michaud-N√©rard, Director General of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to tame cremation is to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want a ceremony to be organized.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they have been trying to spare families the violence of waiting, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the delivery of the ashes," observes Mr. Michaud-N√©rard.
70% of establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcome the assembly, name the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case at P√®re Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
Masters of ceremonies are often people who have reconverted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the P√®re Lachaise crematorium organizes, since 2010, on All Saints' Day, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been cremated during the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is being broadcast online, for those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
Hagel blames 9 US states for violating gay rights
Since the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense ID card and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to combat anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their shops.
The defense secretary said he had ordered National Guard chief Gen. Frank Grass to ensure the federal law is implemented.
The nine-state sling began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard locations, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal same-sex marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage at about 5600 active people, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retirees.
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of inventories offset a report showing China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude for December delivery fell 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel late morning in Europe during electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies rose by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, which showed growth in activity, suggested a rise in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, following a decline not seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnop√©dies by Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as the back wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Th√©√¢tre Maisonneuve, a body walks forward, thin as a line and dressed in black.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple stroke, takes its shape.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a row of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, dressed entirely in black, only hands and faces uncovered, wait on either side of the playing area, rush when the next spelling appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white playing by Henri Michaux is done in relays of solos, in groups in unison (a mass that makes solo), in large groups of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "Gloire du matin", where, solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed in line at the front of the stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monotonous and monotonous in the auction, and continues by dancing.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to resume.
This loud and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - image creation has always been a strength at Chouinard - such as those hair that ruffle or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One has the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed herself, with her tics.
Result: the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt forms, open a wider imagination and game than dance, which is more porous.
Only the ending, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnop√©dies, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a neglected house.
At the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass in love duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, the writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, sporting red noses, in highly polarized male-female courtships.
Loves are carnivorous, elusive or playful.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the play really takes off after the salute.
A clown returns to the scene when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored are superimposed, the dancers cabotinate, descend among the spectators, grumble, smoke, short-circuit, play the codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness transpire, and it is Chouinard's art to contaminate the public.
Major fire in a business
A fire seriously damaged a business in the borough of LaSalle, in Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Emergency services were called around 1 a.m. on Friday because of a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with R√©jane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to control the blaze.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the chief of operations of the Service de s√©curit√© incendie de Montr√©al, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may need to be housed temporarily, the SIM said.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
The reveal is the most significant event featured in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's close aides conducted "extensive group work and polling in late 2011" to see if Biden's ouster could help Obama for re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect replacing the vice president with former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within Chicago campaign HQ and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisers ‚Äî including Daley, former Obama campaign chairman Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe ‚Äî knew change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I looked at a whole bunch of issues, and this was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "concerted," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign invested heavily in finding out if change would be beneficial in the election.
"Campaigns don't spend a lot of money on surveys and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin told AC360.
However, it's unclear whether Obama was aware that his team was reviewing the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president "was aware" of the eventual change, the former secretary general admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether political polls had arrived on Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know Biden's ouster from the presidential list was being considered.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
David Bowie: four unreleased songs listening
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he has concocted a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several previously unreleased material.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album had left everyone stunned.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, dates from 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to make the pop scene sparkle.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeve with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has planned to reissue this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he has concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box set in a video.
He introduces both each of the records, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics ...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a rock electricity cleverly controlled.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is two-sided: a disturbing intro before a luminous cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, mesmerizing, make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: alternately informant, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is not surprising that he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, of which he embodies the new face.
He will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
A bird winched from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, winched after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water rail was loaded onto a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month before it was re-established by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue centre.
The centre's director, Colin Seddon, said: "This water rail was probably a wintering migrant that came from northern Europe and got caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water rail was healthy when released.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in the not-so-distant future.
The subsidiary of Cogeco said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," explained Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a specific date for this new platform.
"You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our clients do not currently have access to.
Telecom giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, can be fixed.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable companies to make its service available through their streaming platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of paying for pick-and-pay services.
"It's been about two and a half years that we've been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large packages of channels, it does not work," said Mr. Audet.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"From these discussions, a new kind of frame of reference will have to emerge to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," said the CEO. of Cogeco.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported net income of ¬¢43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¬¢ per share.
This is down from ¬¢44.9 million, or 83¬¢ per share, in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired U.S.-based cable operator Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for $1.36 billion.
This was the company's first major acquisition after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
Net income at its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was ¬¢43.9 million, or 90¬¢ per share, down from ¬¢45.7 million, or 93¬¢ per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to $470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased to 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about the number of clients fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller says Bulgaria's pipeline ushers in a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom director said.
"A historic event took place today: Construction has started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe," Alexei Miller, Gazprom's chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of Russia's gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional channels, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction to European Union member Bulgaria means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Unknown assailants shoot at a hotel near Cairo's pyramids
Unknown hooded men opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without causing casualties, the consequence of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, said Interior Ministry spokesman Gen. Abdel Latif.
The attack comes as Egypt has received almost no tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodily repressed protests by his supporters.
Schools encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
As part of the English literature classes, students will be required to study at least one Shakespeare play, a nineteenth-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present.
The exam will also feature "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will have to take an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and maths syllabuses tomorrow ‚Äì the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes in other fundamental subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Regulatory Board of Examinations, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new marking system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a "broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", insisting that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
While there is no formal requirement to devote more hours of the timetable to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the in-depth maths GCSE ‚Äì as well as the increased emphasis on subjects in international rankings ‚Äì would likely encourage schools to provide more teaching hours.
The program will place greater emphasis on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe's institutional mysteries.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues ‚Äì ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws ‚Äì the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread discontent, with companies saying the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area ‚Äì 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and most tellingly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a significant majority wanted Britain to continue with initiatives for treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "meaningful change" that puts power back in the UK.
The stakes are high ‚Äì changing the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would see a 16% swing in votes to remain in the EU in a referendum.
The prime minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
It also shows that companies hope the renegotiation will be a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of returning to UK hands.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British business, as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as our survey findings show, for businesses this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
Beijing blames Turkmen Islamic movement
"Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia," the head of China's security organs told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted late Thursday on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
It was the first time a Chinese official had named a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, drove their car loaded with cans of gasoline against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother perished in the car fire.
Etim, which says it is fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of China's Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 as an al-Qaeda-affiliated organization.
This movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after getting stuck 15m above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a minor road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking his dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters rappelled down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death.
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to safely retrieve him as he was perched 15m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a car accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made an appeal on social networking sites after she disappeared in the quarry following a minor accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, stuck 15m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and rappelled down to save Ruby using an animal stretcher to carry her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was right in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue ‚Äì she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said, "Ruby was very lucky to escape unscathed."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; His general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified watching the rescue."
At first I didn't believe she was up there.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The vet said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she probably would have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful, each and every one of them has been absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid she would fall but she didn't move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Ukraine nears bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's government debt securities is upgraded to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least a one-in-three chance that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will guarantee enough foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs," the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
As these reserves, which the authorities rely heavily on to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapse, the agency considers a devaluation increasingly likely, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to pay for its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not having paid a bill of $ 882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government at a time of high tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev's desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the crisis of 2008-2009.
The country, in budget deficit, has been asking for months for help from the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it in 2010 a credit of 15.3 billion dollars and has released for the moment only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including raising gas prices to the population.
At the end of another unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "large external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect an improvement in the short term".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," presidential elections are scheduled for 2015, the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions on the release of opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that if an EU-Kiev free trade zone is created, it would have to tighten border controls for imported goods.
Singapore's pawnshops are taking advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemeer Mall, Janani Amirthalinga drops off a bracelet, ring and pair of gold earrings to pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia ‚Äì where household debt is rising ‚Äì that ValueMax, where it completed its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pawning jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash ‚Äì S$1,300 in Ms. Amirthaliga's case ‚Äì but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pawnshops charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not asking for credit checks or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and household and consumer over-indebtedness.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to make up the difference as their economies slow.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly stemming from rising mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and slowing consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the pay scale] are looking to supplement their income as best they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people rush to pawn their belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pawned in the city-state's 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The rise is such in the pawnshop sector that ValueMax, operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia ‚Äì where it already has four stores ‚Äì but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them using 60% of the Singapore $66 million it raised this week in its IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have come under fire for the exorbitant interest rates they charge, Yeah says pledging not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also doesn't directly increase debt.
"Customers are mortgaging assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
Pledges are becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term secured financing.
The people who go to pawnshops are also not only those who have financial problems.
Wealthy Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pawn shops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
"They can be affluent people who need to borrow short-term for business activities or investments, or small businesses that need cash to get through a difficult time," Yeah adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Cocaine lawyer who informed drug sponsor of police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court.
A prominent defense lawyer, who had informed a drug godfather of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug trafficking activities after compromising himself because of his cocaine habit.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "case of prime importance", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretapping operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he unlawfully sought information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other men, they were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth ¬£1.5m, as well as more than ¬£200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would come to light.
Today at Liverpool Assize Court, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, fell from grace after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's downfall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60 percent pure, under the lawyer's garbage cans in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium at Ewood Park, home of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drugs and they phoned each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests showed traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He said he spoke to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and attempted to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken.
During questioning, he stated that he had an office at his home and at his place of work, and that clients sometimes called him home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that it was calling major players in the drug trade, including some it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew about it.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to break the law, it is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with individual clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but disgraced it.
He got too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal conduct and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 p.m., I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he started sourcing drugs from criminal organisations."
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to ulterior motives from leading members of organized crime groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and build public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit has investigated Mr Ditta, who has been convicted of all three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting the criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta held a Q&A session about himself in which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Renault weighed down on the stock market by Nissan's warning
Renault on Friday posted the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders reported.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a revision, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that Renault shares were affected this morning by the "warning".
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning," says a trading manager at a Paris broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan's capital and the Japanese automaker 15 percent of France, according to data from Nissan's website.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was engulfed in flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 H√©bert Street, was the subject of three alarms by the fire department.
The fire broke out at the front, but rose on all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Service de protection contre les incendies de Qu√©bec, said the rapid intervention of firefighters prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built close together.
The burned house housed four units, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, although the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the sappers have ruled out the theory of a criminal act.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de sant√© et services sociaux (CSSS) de Laval caused quite a stir for the management of the Cit√©-de-la-Sant√© Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or departures at all, the pharmacy department has been severely understaffed.
It lacked nearly 30% of the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire independent labour, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
Troubleshooting was not used, explained Ms. Beaudet.
We have rationalized or reduced some of our activities within the institution to compensate for things to recover.
Of course, we worked hard to get our young [pharmacy residents] interested in coming and staying here.
There is a combination of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, 2013-2014 promises to be a much easier year for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three more pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it's much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures of last year.
Ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
"For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive three maternity leaves when things are going well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists available to do replacements, so it was more difficult.

Anger over sentencing of one of Bali's bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in making the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass shooting for the bombings of two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many others.
He was also convicted of numerous other terrorism-related charges, including a spate of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors asked for a life sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, described as a "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, be sentenced to death.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction wrought by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged past the firing squad," Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He slipped into a coma in the aftermath of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and "died" three times while on life support.
Hughes said Patek should have met the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the carnage ‚Äì Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra ‚Äì who were executed 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the latest of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't surrender," Corteen added.
Until recently, he couldn't care less about the grief he might have caused to others.
The verdict came on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," Corteen said.
Patek can, however, appeal his conviction.
Tony Blair has said he will seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his views known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade in office, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Mr Blair reportedly replied, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it can probably happen, so... ¬ª
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security officials said.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist officials said he had lost his life in the strike, which was carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency room of the H√¥tel-Dieu
Faced with the revolt led for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "shift the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies which will not be able to intervene on November 4".
A request officially made "not to run any risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but which also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months before the municipal elections.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if, at the APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, the firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual visits to the emergency room of the H√¥tel-Dieu will all have been instructed to take the thirty serious cases per day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H√¥tel-Dieu, interns specializing in emergencies will give way Monday to five general medicine interns.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the H√¥tel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4," says Lo√Øc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new H√¥tel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergency," he tempers, pointing to the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he also assures.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," replies Nicolas P√©ju, spokesman for the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to her," said emergency doctor Gerald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his post as head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for having led the revolt against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "whistleblower" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergency rooms that were renovated less than five years ago," he said.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
However, they are regularly congested.
For example, there is sometimes a nine-hour wait at the emergency room in Lariboisi√®re.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been reinforced.
At the ARS as at the APHP, we defend the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which should continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also come to participate in the establishment of a "permanent ambulatory care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," wonders G√©rald Kierzek for whom "the concept of not serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for level 3 maternity wards.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change gear, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor of Paris and elected representative of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the H√¥tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled again Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If this were the case, it would mark its clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, its spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the H√¥tel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of transfer to other hospitals.
Did you think travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be turning the tide.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and is hoping for record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit for the full year of between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Chief executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre made 8% profit in the first half of the year and the second half got off to a strong start, particularly in non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
"Since the beginning of the year, all 10 countries in which we operate have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the full year before interest and taxes," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel business performed well while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand is weaker and was expected to turn a profit for the full year for the third time in a row.
Shares of Flight Centre rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with manually reclining seatbacks, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the reclining mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not adequately protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
GM's pickup rollout began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the largest U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM notified pickup owners of the defect during the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner information letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which slowed growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price climbed 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after its singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform at The Hydro concert hall in the city centre on Friday.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to similarly postpone a concert at Birmingham's LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Hydro Glasgow on Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the one at the Hydro in Glasgow will be held on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact customer service at the box office where you purchased your tickets for further assistance.
Toronto mayor chases out journalists who come to question him about drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media reports.
A video handed over to the courts seems to support these suspicions.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having used crack cocaine, while admitting to having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he evicted several journalists from his property who had come to interrogate him.

Pope Francis to appoint its first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on Feb. 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest ranking churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope ‚Äì this amounts to a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of cardinal electors to 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favor Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"Now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "quite possible" for Francis to seek advice from cardinals.
But we've never experienced such a situation ‚Äì it's totally new.
Valero said popes usually elevate bishops representing large communities to cardinal status, but Francis was "full of surprises ‚Äî so we don't know who he will appoint."
Tenants must go to the polls because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the dwelling that goes in taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each unit.
We are forced to raise rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we are sending a clear message.
We need to make a difference in the City.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can no longer afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 million to $5 million worth of land just in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
Vettel wears off special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and warmth at track level.
Germany's Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula 1 world champion, wore a special helmet for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of his team's sponsors, a car brand.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his pit.
Vettel was due to wear the helmet on Friday and Saturday in practice.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, destined to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, while looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his musician's hands splitting the air," Laurie Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the past few years.
And even though we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joie de vivre he had," she adds.
Lou Reed underwent a liver transplant last May.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine in pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to smuggle into the country two kilos of cocaine concealed in pumpkins Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drugs were then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose the woman's whereabouts when she was intercepted.
It's part of the investigation," said CBSA spokesperson Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was coming into the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montr√©al-Trudeau Airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures totalling 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec Region made a total of 1653 drug seizures.
G√©rard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
Phenomenon of the French edition, G√©rard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83 years old, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times called him "the spy writer who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the scene of the 198th and 199th installments of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was moving during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also gone back to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, G√©rard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, claimed to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, nearly half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million all countries combined," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his lap, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, his mischievous eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages into which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not to mention the pirate editions," he added, pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table between bronzes or ivories brought back from the 130 countries surveyed to situate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs to the family castle, goes after all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," explained G√©rard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send messages to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert Londres, who went there and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS's father said he was "making a kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added G√©rard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people from the services that I have known for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In "The Madmen of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who melted on the Malian capital.
I am not a soothsayer, defended G√©rard de Villiers, I simply make hypotheses from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM daisy typewriter dating from 1976 "whose parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "END" and corrected each page with a pen.
On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly singled out for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, G√©rard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa where I have many readers.
G√©rard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die or retire.
Neither do I.

Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a coat of light: one could come close to the heat stroke in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, and not by traders' associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Beijing blames Uighur group for Tiananmen attack
China's internal security chief on Friday accused a group of Uighur separatists in Xinjiang of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, plowed into the crowd in the Chinese capital's famous square, a symbol of the deadly crackdown in 1989, and caught fire, killing its three passengers and two bystanders.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic Movement of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority living in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by demands for independence.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group that was standing behind the scenes was the East Turkestan Islamic Movement," he added, with Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Painted lights: MP calls for Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to "facelift" traffic light poles in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 traffic light poles in the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long term, to repaint all Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "Flemishisation" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with spending the money of the people of Brussels madly in operations to relift the traffic poles in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of Flemishization of the Capital," protests Mr. De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted the Brussels poles in yellow-dark blue-black herself.
According to the MEP, there is now "no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is carrying out the NVA's programme herself.
It is high time to stop Flanders' Trojan horse.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of Brussels residents!", concludes Mr De Bock.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is stranded.
The leak of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear boilers of the Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has just confirmed the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, specialist in naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
For them, among other things, it is a question of changing a pump on the failing boiler room.
"Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its deployment planned for the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the Navy to certify that "it does not call into question the program of activity of the boat" nuclear-powered.
Recall that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle comes out of a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had set sail from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", limited to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the French Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
He goes to the supermarket in Nazi uniform, before being chased away.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with an armband with the swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, as customers complained to the establishment's management who called police, the store said Friday.
"We have received several complaints from customers, so we have asked him to leave the store," said a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda.
The store called police to the rescue, but "by the time she arrived, he was already gone without a fuss," she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were speechless.
"You don't go out on the street unless you want to get attention," customer Rosina Rusin, 60, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, when it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was unclear if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," Dutton said, explaining that he suffers from "mental problems".
