Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the plan to cancel the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The deputies refused at second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for concluding an apparently disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the condemned in December.
Tymosenko calls the judgment a political revenge for the regime and has sparked a process of suspicion of court bias also in the west.
The project to cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the ex-Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its vanquished.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals?
The Provisional National Council has decreed customary Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a theft one cuts the hand.
Women can forget emancipation, those who do not respect the faith are liable to capital punishment...
It is the Koran which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot imagine and as we would surely not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for Libyans.
It is particularly amazing that the Islamist warriors gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who was directing the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to looking for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in shootings, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to get rid of the &quot;crusaders&quot;.
Without land occupation, will oil companies have easy access to Libyan black gold?
Maybe not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
As long as these followers of Sharia prevent us from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states has published GDP information for the 3As.
The Czech economy has stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not just looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical offices in the Eurozone, Germany, Czechia and other European countries released earlier their views on economic development for the third quarter.
Germany&#39;s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France&#39;s by 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany performed better than expected (0.3% growth instead of the 0.1% expected), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was originally a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading for a gradual decrease in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts&#39; forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy had in the third quarter a growth of 0.5% according to the data forecast and periodically recalculated.
The economy of the eurozone and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with what analysts had expected.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on ten-year bonds is 28.45%
Bond yields from Spain and Italy are climbing towards critical limits.
The problems are starting to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields on Czech bonds remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort.
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro they also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football defended dearly with also a good deal of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for the European championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the great Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first minutes we played warrior football.
Both teams struggled to put together combinations and play was mostly centered around the center line.
The pressure from the national footballers failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country&#39;s nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred graduate school students created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support with this gesture the nuclear program of their country in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan universities created a human shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is processed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country&#39;s nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear armament.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where the uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: do not eat breakfast and eat cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important is the environment in which the human being evolves and the models which surround him.
On the tables of obese children, for example, meats are found 50% more often than in families with children of normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries for dinner according to the survey carried out with an awareness campaign &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;
Sport is also not a habit in the families of the little fat children, which is now the case for most school children today - only 15% answered that at least once a week the parents find the time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have signed up for this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children is the absence of a correct diet and not enough physical exercise.
&quot;Only half of the children questioned indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - snack-dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet&quot;, indicates one of the results of the study. &#39;investigation.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that healthy development requires a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of student families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families with obese children eat unhealthy fries more often.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned play sports regularly but for the parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
&quot;The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from the ideal in terms of healthy food&quot;.
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
&quot;The most alarming thing is notably a great preference for sweet lemonades&quot;, is stated in the results of the survey.
For lunch, pasta took first place just ahead of white meat.
The children did not want any starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading for health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
&quot;During a control of a group of participants in the survey who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, we witnessed a very determined desire to move towards an healthy eating,&quot; say the survey results.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades because the children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often ticked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as main course and would reduce sweet dishes and &quot;knedliky&quot; (Czech specialty of bread flour or potato dumplings).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In an overview article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were a lot of them early on.
I didn&#39;t think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what happens on site.
And it will be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it&#39;s really &quot;crammed&quot;.
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy&#39;s body, without any particular curve, another is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We managed to emphasize the character nicely and also not to dress too showy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a large chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that the skirts or trousers do not fit at all, it is worth having it made to measure.
And you won&#39;t regret it because clothing that fits impeccably is priceless.
In a made-to-measure skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly slips, rolls up and does not fit on the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance, they can afford Tucker-style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabric, or even embroidery.
There are obviously a lot of examples of various appearances and I&#39;m glad I have all week to sort through all the information received.
But I&#39;m also afraid that for what I have to do at home there is too much.
Each trainee was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We have to take into consideration the current appearance, personality mode type as well as appearance.
I will have to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria&#39;s Secret campaign.
Deep down, I&#39;m happy because it&#39;s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred pounds lately (please don&#39;t take my statement completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work on the design.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
Also thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress the physique in this way but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on given products the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, told us all about it.
But this...until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three specialty guests gave a diverse look to Saturday&#39;s session filled with information about the different character types.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one piece of clothing in a different way.
Variability is essential for this example.
Like for example this trench coat which must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a picture of it like a dress .
Or just roll up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
&quot;Play with it&quot; he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: &quot;For work you need to know the rules perfectly&quot;.
&quot;You can then start violating it,&quot; Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we strive to learn these rules, what to do with them, towards what, why, whereas in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben, that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than are photographed.
That is to say that for a fashion story which will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I must be ready to &quot;recut&quot; at least fifteen.
And also, a piece of clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to reckon with this during a creation of a model.
The fact that image and style are sometimes half the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is still cautious.
And known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem comes second).
And if someone gets a styling done from us, then we have to rely on the fact that they dictate to us with a high probability a completely different (smaller) size than they actually have.
Then we just have to browse on google and make sure if the boulevard info mentions the celebrity in question, if she has lost weight or gained weight etc...
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not flattering yourself, keeping your opinion.
&quot;When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items, you can&#39;t just throw it all away and tell her, My God, how awful.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;ll find a few things that you think are pretty and he&#39;ll advise you what to wear them with,&quot; Mario says.
This one showed us concretely what must all contain what is called the &quot;placovka&quot; or stylist&#39;s bag.
It&#39;s the one you hang around your waist and carry around for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for depilation or even safety pins, there are also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), clips specials with which to close a garment in the back, if it is too big (the pin or other type of staple cannot be used because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we weren&#39;t just people who listened but tried something in a practical way, they taught us how to resole shoes properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is even, the sole could be damaged, especially on the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently hurt ourselves.
So you really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The skill I am reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I am beginning to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is disputed across America.
Revision
From a trouble-free run, a series of stupid mistakes by people who don&#39;t care turns into a routine morning trip to work.
It satisfies everyone&#39;s ambition to a certain extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new part subtitled The Run produced high expectations ahead of its release.
It promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and release a kind of game from the playable parts that wouldn&#39;t just be counted with points.
We were therefore curious how the added passages will be during which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
They are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing drags down because of some unnecessary faults that have already existed for several years.
These are not really errors but rather an expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
The result is that each race is done on a different route and the stages planned in different environments which are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are moreover quite pretty even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Finally it is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snow-capped mountains is very pleasing visually.
The proofs are also from time to time embellished with an atypical element.
For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm which significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Besides that, the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few, but that&#39;s enough.
There are moments you strive to overcome the requested number of opponents (like in a classic race) then you will race against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then another duel with an opponent awaits you.
From time to time you also have the police come into play and try to make things difficult for you.
New are the out-of-vehicle passages.
It&#39;s more of an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What&#39;s surprising is that there are fewer such moments than you&#39;d expect (to be concrete there are only three).
With the result it is good like that because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements which decorate the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but we cannot say that it is negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to look elsewhere.
But although you can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet developed.
We don&#39;t expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you don&#39;t have any idea when colliding with any object how your auto behaves, it&#39;s not is therefore not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other lightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy aerobatics.
Or else finds itself in pieces.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken your face or you have gone out into the scenery, the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you have used all 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it&#39;s more of a tool, in case something goes wrong, than something you can actually rely on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and you have to find the solution by recalling from memory the piece of route in question.
The big problem with this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain bends that you have to pass in a certain way otherwise it won&#39;t pass.
Otherwise you will encounter &quot;civilian&quot; vehicles in a given location, always in the same configuration whether you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds early or one minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent pass easily between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you have to either step aside and go around them or brake.
It doesn&#39;t matter if you go in front of him because it is &quot;calculated&quot; in such a way that for the given situation he always comes close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages as well.
During the whole time of the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent who precedes you in the same place.
This irritates the most in the late game when you&#39;re rolling over a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The adversary must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it blocks the view of other oncoming vehicles and you collide a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it&#39;s a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don&#39;t have time to follow everything that happens.
And it does not matter if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You must pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars there, however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for city driving, American muscle cars for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic trappings for highly technical driving such as winding roads in the mountains.
And the challenges mode, which are races in particular locations that you know from the adventure, goes really well with the main story scheme.
You not only receive medals but also experience points which are added to your profile which is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different items begin to unlock:
This connects on-line with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results obtained with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult moves to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you comes a metro train that sends the car straight to the scrapyard.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone really thought during the creation of this game or if the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not great, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What bothers is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold up, and in some cases tragically so.
This especially concerns crashes with a large number of participants when smooth imagery is no longer of any use to you.
The sound part is good and the track is your choice.
In order to appeal to as many people as possible and especially to young audiences a new soundtrack has been created in the style &quot;I mix everything&quot;, but it can be expected that no one will buy the game for the music .
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game didn&#39;t have these stupid errors we could safely say that this is NFS&#39; best production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for the fouls to smack you in the eye with the force of an airfield reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
&quot;The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions&quot;
&quot;I did not expect such a harsh war&quot;.
&quot;It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role&quot;, this is how Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she succeeded in describing the different bodies of the EU and their relationships so clearly and visibly that many lecturers at Charles University Law School would envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her &quot;understandable and open about Europe&quot; motto.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
&quot;Right from the start there were the criticisms that he&#39;s bland, he&#39;s a piece of cake, he can&#39;t do any job and I have to say he took everyone&#39;s breath away because he holds his role to perfection.
&quot;He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicates well with them and has a clear vision of the direction Europe should take&quot;.
She explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defense Policy as part of an answer to the question: &quot;Who is who in the European Union?&quot; &quot;Which telephone number should I call?&quot;, therefore as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater clarity of the Union&#39;s policy vis-à-vis states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs solved the growing financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, &quot;activity was in full swing&quot; not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which continues to resolve even now.
It is also necessary to approve the new seventh budget of the Union which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels &quot;For an understandable Europe&quot;.
&quot;I really don&#39;t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted gherkins, differently large bananas or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky&quot;.
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in EU institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative rather than positive aspects.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault results, according to her, from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group.
&quot;Believe me, when the Poles, the Magyars, the Slovaks come towards me, this Frenchman says to me: &#39;Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?&#39; at all happy&quot;.
According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future, new tough rules in terms of budgetary policy await member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed one, which prevails rather than a &quot;new European Federation&quot;.
&quot;We have countries in the euro zone and others outside the zone.&quot;
&quot;We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation&quot;.
In the first place, it was said that the countries which want it cooperate with each other and those which do not want it stay in their corner.
&quot;There will be many institutes of this type and there will be a really two-speed Europe&quot;, expects Mrs Vicenova.
From this point of view she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases according to which all the topics having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all the members of the EU and not only members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the term that most closely expresses IBM&#39;s strategy, the closest would be &quot;the long term&quot;.
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt to be very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm&#39;s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that many of the world&#39;s problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Its slogan &quot;THINK!&quot; has become the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was the foundation of Watson&#39;s carefully crafted corporate culture.
For us IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it always remained faithful to its basic values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around it.
It has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more&quot;, declared for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the thirties, took care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance paid by the employer plus a uniform elegant employee service and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and salespeople.
Similarly IBM has a well developed customer relations system.
The company was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the past few years has been doing so-called jamy, online brainstorming from which a lot of future strategies and innovations have come.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that assures it of a secure position in the business domain.
&quot;From the beginning IBM had a concept more of an institution than a technology firm,&quot; said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at the Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
&quot;IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,&quot; added Geogre Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the &quot;Big Blue&quot;, as it is familiarly called in the United States in view of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest firms in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services from server products to nanotechnology.
It has numerous patents from all American technology firms and five of its employees have been awarded a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are for example the cash dispenser, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the floppy disk.
IBM found itself this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time in 1996 it overtook Microsoft.
Preview in advance
It is not all the innovations and productions that were preferred by the customer and at the time - IBM, for example, did not succeed in betting on its own OS/2 operating system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“Once your business is built on moving forward, you can&#39;t emotionally hang on to the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano points out.
For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, Microsoft&#39;s competitor, which basically stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a dominating place.
However, still in 1990 she was with more than half participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Beginning in 2000, IBM sold low-yielding assets for $15 billion, during which time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
It now appears that IBM is passing the current crisis without being worried?
IBM&#39;s share price has rocketed from 2008 by 120 percent, the firm&#39;s net profit continues to grow.
The logo of the IBM firm is to change everything but not its values.
We can therefore expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old &quot;time clocks&quot;, clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the company&#39;s Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - it is on Watson&#39;s ideas that the identity and culture of the company are based until now.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During Watson&#39;s first four years in office, revenues multiplied to $9 million and began the firm&#39;s expansion into all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC which determined the computer standard of the time with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The successful strategy at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept &quot;a smarter planet&quot;.
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and city management.
As far as commerce is concerned, IBM has recently developed a &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot; platform which helps salespeople manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team dealing with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don&#39;t want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it&#39;s over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she could not wait and made clear rules for the future life.
&quot;Pepa can come home, but not like my partner&quot; explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova shelter in her house in the summer, she had no idea that her marriage would not last.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer away.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned herself, accepted her husband&#39;s affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to greet him on the doorstep of the house.
&quot;He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will kick him out&quot;.
“He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,” Rychtarova leaked, showing that she has broken away from her husband but they only remain in a relationship decent.
The fact that Darina closed the door on him is not a problem for Joseph.
&quot;I respect my wife&#39;s decision.&quot;
&quot;I will stay with Iveta and not change&quot;.
&quot;My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy&quot;.
&quot;With Darina we chat in a completely normal way but we don&#39;t sleep together,&quot; Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not prevent it.
&quot;We are not sleeping together and I am not interested in knowing where she is going, with whom and if she is having an affair.
I know it&#39;s my fault, I fell in love with &quot;Iveta and I take all the responsibility on me&quot;, concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, everyone, like the other, is able to pull them &quot;out of their sleeve&quot;.
My dear ladies, you are going to know in the following lines feminine vices which succeed in pumping the blood from the veins of men.
purchases
Does your other half tell you that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one item of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of the sales?
In your case, we can speak of purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which one would resist window shopping in clothing stores, looking for pretty clothes for oneself and then trying them all on in the cabin (ideally in different colors)?
And while shopping is a hobby for most women, it can be hell for a man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse to wait at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
&quot;I&#39;m not too fat&quot;?
&quot;I need to lose at least 5 kilos - should I start exercising?&quot;
&quot;Do you like it?&quot;
Don&#39;t these sentences remind you of something?
Yes?
You are therefore one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It&#39;s not the question that you should stop caring about yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to their partner always complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases, the more poisonous women become.
Order and cleanliness come first
It&#39;s like an endless merry-go-round.
Washing the windows, vacuuming, cleaning the floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you remark to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have dirty the sink, dirty the window in the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to bear in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of undermining
&quot;Put that used tracksuit in the trash.&quot;
&quot;Are you going to put those old socks on again tomorrow?&quot;
&quot;A wet towel has no place on the floor&quot;.
If you do this undermining on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn&#39;t have to do so much undermining...
Defamation, defamation
Defamation, mockery but also insults against someone are also specific to some women.
Women are particularly relationship oriented and so are happy to deal with topics like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a harmless little quip here and there.
The hand on the heart is however a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, mock, even despise others and are for those around them - especially at work in a women&#39;s collective - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr played twice in Philadelphia&#39;s victory in Monday&#39;s NHL game on Carolina ice and is once again the top Czech player in the competition.
From the perspective of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made one more assist and was named the game&#39;s best player, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek who plays with Jagr also registered two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told reporters across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great night.
&quot;I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick&quot;.
&quot;I have felt it&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes that feeling hits you,&quot; Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored on the Flyers&#39; first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault from the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes goal for the puck and presented it to striker Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a run, but the start of the second game belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds converted a fourth goal.
&quot;I love playing with him.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t want to say he&#39;s the best player in the league but he&#39;s definitely in the top three,&quot; Jagr said of his center.
&quot;I never thought I would play at the end of my career with a hokeyj player like him&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m really happy about that.&quot;
&quot;I want to play on him&quot;.
&quot;All these years in the NHL the other players on the team tried to play on me, now it&#39;s my turn,&quot; added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she finished with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out further complications which ended at two against one.
&quot;Pronger made excellent attacks in our zone.&quot;
&quot;He kicked the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) went to the far corner of the cage.
&quot;I tried to hit it and I succeeded,&quot; described the last goal of the game from his Voracek perspective.
Philadelphia came in with that win as the Eastern Conference lead.
Montreal&#39;s Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo as he went out in the second period due to an upper body injury.
The Candians did not hold their two-goal lead against an experienced defender and lost after a penalty kick by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec didn&#39;t convert any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mainly bothered the local coach rather than lost points because they only played the match with 5 defenders.
&quot;It sucks&quot;.
&quot;We only played the match with an experienced player, the rest were young people&quot;.
&quot;But there is nothing to do, it&#39;s like that&quot;, says Jacques Martin.
&quot;Replacement after replacement was not enough and we couldn&#39;t resist&quot;.
&quot;We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our zone.&quot;
For that we had limits,&quot; added one of the PK Subban defenders.
Czech defender Ondrej Pavelec took part in Winnipeg&#39;s 30th attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets&#39; goals, which ended a 5-game losing streak.
How have travel prices evolved since 1989?
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mostly to countries of the socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays to East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a western inclination and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, you had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or else have a &quot;good knowledge&quot; within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency deal that was a condition for traveling west was denied to &quot;politically incorrect&quot; people who couldn&#39;t travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was however not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought for themselves and this habit lasts until now.
The travels of the Czechs have since experienced a great revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 vacations in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak, last year Czechs spent 4 million vacation days abroad in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in the western neighboring countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west, which everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example in Paris the travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip in those days was to take your own tinned food, sausage, etc. with you to save money.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after decades to be able to freely buy western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for trips, travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter connections which, thanks to contracts, have reduced costs considerably compared to what there was before.
At the end of the 90s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free connections with practically most developed countries around the world apart from the USA which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations starting from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period which symbolizes our post-revolution development happened in 2008.
on November 17, 2008 the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to completely belong to the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including additional charges. Crowns per person.
The general assembly must find its President but this risks ending in a situation without a solution &quot;one pat&quot;
Almost 5 months already, Czech football is without a President and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic will not yet be known after another General Assembly which is to take place on Thursday in Nymburk. .
However, there is still no agreement on which voting rules should be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality who will lead football into the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era has football reverted back to differences between the chambers of the Association which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully shown on September 16 when a new president had to be chosen.
The General Assembly delegates met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was not even a question of dealing with the way of electing.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, statutory representatives or also fully empowered officials.
On this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the help also of the Office for the State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences still continue over the rules for the election.
It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the crux always remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the trap.
&quot;The bone of contention lies in the following fact: either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model&quot;, noted one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the candidate who has received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins in the third round.
Moravia is rumored to be ready to step aside so that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the voting percentages.
&quot;Only that would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and that would completely reject the bicameral concept&quot;, admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian side and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he considers that the regulations of the elections established according to the statutes benefit Pelta the most among all the candidates.
&quot;I would like us to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association&quot;.
&quot;So that there are no more absurd ideas imagined by a representative as during past General Assemblies&quot;, declared the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
&quot;The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone&quot;.
&quot;Football will be on a wave of happiness again and there will be more enthusiasm for cooperation&quot; adds the officer from Jablonec who among the three has the most experience in football management both professionally and at the level regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
&quot;I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the rules on the fly&quot;.
&quot;This can again cause a deadlock in the General Assembly&quot;.
&quot;I still hope that sound reason will win,&quot; said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the whole football management will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorice, among others, did not take off for technical reasons and an alternative was sought to take part of the executive committee to the ground of reprisals.
In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the parties torn within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka&#39;s financial problems.
Paclik goes to fight for the position of President because he sees no suitable candidate.
If the head of Plzen footballers Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put campaigning for this high office.
&quot;If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I do not stand for election.&quot;
&quot;But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate,&quot; Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik&#39;s motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl precisely to try to prevent Pelta from reaching the head of the AFRT which would a priori be the favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that if he wins the elections, he would hold this post of President only until 2013, the year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not linked to the world of football.
&quot;I discussed with people who would have the profile&quot;, he says.
&quot;For me it was terrible when some told me that they didn&#39;t want to be identified with Czech football at this time.&quot;
“I would like to change this image,” he added.
What is said to particularly embarrass Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man of controversial fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing on the vote of the delegates &#39; the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position of President.
&quot;If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football.&quot;
&quot;And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less football friendly,&quot; Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta&#39;s name was mentioned a few years ago during wiretaps as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got off without any sadness.
&quot;I don&#39;t know what prestige Pelta would bring to football.&quot;
&quot;And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA&quot; says Paclik, who said some time ago &quot;if Pelta becomes President, I will sell the Plzen club&quot;.
Should Paclik win Thursday&#39;s vote, he would have to prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September which had ended in a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with.&quot;
“He has great abilities”
&quot;He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of representation&quot;.
&quot;But as Association manager he wouldn&#39;t be able to.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t put my nose in what I don&#39;t know&quot;, indicates Paclik who in September attracted great attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Referees Committee with Ludek Macela replaced by Dagmar Damkova .
Paclik says he would be up to the task of leading the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and that he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated its triumph in the first division with his support last May.
&quot;I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it&quot;.
&quot;I would curb the influence of certain interested groups which, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to situations in bad taste&quot;, added Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level politicians would make it possible to obtain more gambling tax money for sport.
&quot;This is one of the key points that the new President should take care of&quot;.
&quot;If it&#39;s about the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,&quot; he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Pilsen club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be &quot;above parties&quot;.
Pelta is linked again with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
&quot;It&#39;s not ideal.&quot;
I don&#39;t see any reason to pass on my actions from the Pilsen club to someone if I have to come back after a year and a half,&quot; Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes which should put an end in the future to quarrels about of the regulations for the elections.
The official from Jablonec is very optimistic before Thursday&#39;s meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the success of the football representation today should calm this squabble before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised precisely to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and present it in a broad context.
&quot;People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President on Thursday.&quot;
&quot;They feel it&#39;s the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association&quot;, he adds, but he is above all linked with the Jablonec club, has worked for a large number of years to Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
this is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that prevailed during the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately at the General Assembly in June some statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone noticed”.
&quot;If it weren&#39;t for all these various interpretations we would have already had a President since September&quot;, underlines Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took all the attention of the delegates.
&quot;If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take on all the responsibilities in the event that it does not work out&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s a principle without which we cannot exist,&quot; Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his adversaries.
He has previously declared that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl whom he recognizes in view of his training in law and that he knows full well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He also hasn&#39;t attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
&quot;He has been in football for a year and has already had some success.&quot;
&quot;His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s also why some now have doubts about his character,&quot; Pelta told his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It should be a football showcase.
&quot;And I would also endeavor to finish all the cases which begin with that of the Gypsies or else the continuation of the scandal of corruption.&quot;
&quot;I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football,&quot; the 46th candidate told Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change in people.
&quot;I should get to know all the employees,&quot; he told Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he thinks that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
&quot;If there is a single point of contention on how to vote in the third round, we will manage to overcome it&quot;.
&quot;Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its helm,&quot; as Pelta optimistically declared two days before the likely defining day for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start hard work
&quot;If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it seems.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and making the members of the Executive Committee responsible for different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
&quot;As President I want to take care of football as a whole&quot;.
&quot;International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and successful youth football.&quot;
&quot;But I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ll do all of this alone,&quot; Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
&quot;I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area.&quot;
&quot;And I will distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward&quot;.
&quot;A lot of people won&#39;t be happy because it&#39;s going to be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,&quot; he added.
He reportedly said he would not run again due to a critical atmosphere.
&quot;About me, it is known that I work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;but I need to know if it&#39;s worth it and if I will have people behind me who will constantly put obstacles in my way and cast doubt on my every action&quot;, explaining why he hesitated.
&quot;A lot of people still told me that I shouldn&#39;t give up because they would give up too.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a trust I can&#39;t betray,&quot; he says.
What motivates him, they say, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
&quot;Over the past two years there has been a lot of work done and I don&#39;t want to let it down.&quot;
&quot;There are processes that have been launched which will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them.&#39;, he declared with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union does not return to how it was before Hasek.
&quot;I believe in systematic work and this is something that Mirek Pelta does not know how to do&quot;.
&quot;Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen.&quot;
&quot;I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for supporting someone&quot;.
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it, not just those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
&quot;And if anyone says otherwise, I&#39;m ready to do my best for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it&#39;s time to consider the second division being divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian whose winners would end up in the first division.&quot;
&quot;There wouldn&#39;t be a situation like now with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem right now is finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Pilsen club, has entered the competition for the post of president, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
&quot;I constantly feel the support of the Czech Chamber which elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes&quot;, declared Rajchl who envisages among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the law on games.
He says on the contrary that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all.
While he says about Pelta &quot;that he is disqualified because with him Czech football would lose credibility&quot;, he thinks second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
&quot;No one can doubt in Pilsen that he has done a superb job this year&quot;.
&quot;If elected he would surely continue with what was started by Hasek and make no noticeable change among the people in the Commissions.&quot;
&quot;He wouldn&#39;t want to waste his success,&quot; said Rajchl, who assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A leap into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in UFO optics, magnificent pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after touring the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in sparkling water baths .
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past 18 months, there is one item that should not be missing in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she gazed at the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and admired the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she immediately jotted down in her notebook all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: &quot;Badefreuden (Joys of the Bath&quot;. The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, &quot;Hardcore concrete buildings&quot; in the Taunus.
She has conducted her &quot;trips to the most exceptional baths of Central Europe&quot; in 13 countries. Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fan of bathing culture.
Meder explains that she doesn&#39;t have much of an interest in the sport, but she finds herself drawn to the water in a totally different way.
It&#39;s irritating that swim fans have to settle for staring at blue tiles and put up with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe in the heady scent of spruce forests or can listen to the chirping of cheerful birds in the park.
“I once wondered why swimming pools must in fact always be so ugly,” said the Viennese.
&quot;So I was starting a collection of beautiful baths.&quot;
The surface of the water reinforces the architecture doubly
A dip in a swimming pool and the volatile sauna oils - the feel-good factor in the swimming halls are enormous because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had taken a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor, there is a surface of water in the swimming rooms.&quot;
&quot;It is on one side transparent, but on the other side however reflects the beauty of the entire building.&quot;
All the surfaces present themselves optically in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume &quot;Badefreuden&quot; makes an interesting 190-page report on the architectural and cultural history of the historic wellness oasis - it certainly makes you want to jump into blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable examples during her research in Hungary.
Alongside splendid wellness baths like the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zürich bath you have the whole city in view, you can admire the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise skyward.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all swimming pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate the smell of sulfur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of petroleum, which is hard to believe, being in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its ooze sticks to your skin as soon as you drop into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded field.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Glancing out the window of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she observed the weeds flourishing between the panes.
She observed the opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The spa palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its conception in 1844 but also a Moorish room in the Alhambra style which was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the spa palace has remained the favorite bathing place of swimming pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because she is from Schwarzwald.
&quot;It&#39;s already a great achievement to fuse so many different construction styles into such a great unit,&quot; says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines commodity speculation in detail
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its commodity speculation?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to research the consequences of speculation for the world&#39;s poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg-
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of those questioned even demand that the German bank and other credit institutes discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world&#39;s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities is pushing prices up and that banks share a complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign aligns itself concretely against the head of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But the majority of the experts meanwhile share the opinion that the bettors have detached themselves from offers and demands - and are profiting at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, &quot;no business is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank&quot;.
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report accusations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, after which the results of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds its Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: &quot;The speculation of rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way, how banks are today are detrimental to the general interest.&quot;
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
&quot;Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,&quot; Bode said.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it&#39;s about starving people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake.&quot;
Ackermann&#39;s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he does not have to worry about much - his successor will care.
One in two would terminate investments in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already taken part in the organisation&#39;s campaign.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute carried out questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments where food price bets are made.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would cancel, according to the survey, all investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to those around them, 49% answered that they would think about canceling their account to change banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, stood empty and then fell into disrepair.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass sheds, its lively and bold looks and its new building materials which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer&#39;s pavilion for the 1958 Brussels World&#39;s Fair is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the &quot;Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture&quot; for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
The construction is considered to this day as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian World&#39;s Fair.
With its legendary four-cylinder house from BMW and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally rose to international fame in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the World&#39;s Fair in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the artworks on, so not a good environment.
However, it was also used for a long time, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building had been empty and increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name &quot;House of the 21st century&quot; and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opened the first exhibition - a stroke of luck from every point of view.
The new beginning was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who in 2007 became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby&#39;s, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has carried out particularly well the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, it has obtained public funds and private sponsorship and has established its operation.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal performer.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht&#39;s secession and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was &quot;a place extremely important&quot; place where he had seen &quot;virtually every weekend&quot; the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following its move to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was &quot;an abyss in energy&quot;, says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was fitted and the roof replaced with special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coverings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a dim light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it&#39;s almost new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a red-brown rust protection tint.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it once was.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
&quot;Often good and inexpensive materials had to be found, which also appeal to the monument protection office&quot;, says Krischanitz and draws attention to a rough basement floor.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building has remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, &quot;which came from Brussels,&quot; Krischanitz said recently, a typical &quot;Drop-in-the-City&quot; story.
Such architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;awaken a clear conscience&quot;.
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a matter of a stroke of luck of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden rises precisely the &quot;quarter of the central station&quot; while newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may be coming: the House of the 21st Century could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the temporary art center in Berlin, and as it is said , it is already negotiating with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has drawn up a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; will spend in this regard more than 70 million additional this year.
The daily &quot;Bild&quot;-Zeitung previously reported, citing an internal group crisis plan, that investments totaling around 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and platforms should, among other things, double and increase to 16,000 people.
The aim is to clear the platforms of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the switches needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago station master Rüdiger Grube warned government and industry at a summit conference about train accidents that have also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
Thus many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
Also, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had plenty to do for years, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often in the workshop, after an axle breakage occurred on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot; pays millions in penalties to the USA.
After the boss Josef Ackermann affair there is news in the USA: the German bank &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot; must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with it in the USA: the Frankfurt institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), for settle a dispute due to the failure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial markets regulator NCUA brings a whole series of accusations to the big banks, and that of having incited the cooperative banks to make false promises concerning the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost tremendous value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
“We are satisfied to have been able to find a solution on this subject, without the parties starting a procedure in court”, said an interlocutor of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not admit any fault in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has agreed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed concessions from both banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for cooperative banks in the USA and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage incurred.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks to task and in the summer took JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs to court.
Regarding the issue of mortgage documents it is &quot;Mortgage-backed Securities&quot;.
The credit houses are at the base.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for many banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events date back a few years, a stormy wind is currently blowing over American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous actions to obtain compensation or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She accuses 18 major international banks, the two American state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having benefited in kind during mortgage deals of around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, these are several operations for a total amount of 14.2 billion dollars for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand, that the Frankfurter answer for &quot;substantial losses&quot; but however without quoting a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had dismissed the claims as unjustified and says it wants to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett raises 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal sums in IBM&#39;s IT business.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad forecasts.
However, he read IBM&#39;s reports and changed his opinion on investing in this sector.
He must have already realized much earlier that IBM mainly offers IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight&#39;s attack in the world of finance.
Therefore the IBM IT activity grants itself the right to call itself now &quot;Mr. IBM&quot;.
Because Buffett revealed on the CNBC economics show today that he has bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a major shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said IBM never knew about the commitment until now.
He praised the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
&quot;You did a great job,&quot; Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been banking on lucrative IT services as an operation of accounting centers for some time.
The over 100-year-old IT pioneer offers software and consultation as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
But on the contrary Buffett rather attacks rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machinery.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a whole series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old octogenarian had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and had raised it to the rank of one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense for making money earned him the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;.
After the announcement of Buffett&#39;s investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock market.
&quot;Big Blue&quot;, as IBM is also called, has a stock market value of more than 220 billion dollars and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he does not want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the &quot;Zwickauer cell&quot; the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot;, which would now be reborn.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek business in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey as well as the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turks the specter that we thought was dead for a long time reappears: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this context right-wing extremist against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been questioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
&quot;Is it a return to bloody ideology&quot;, &quot;This was the title of the internet publication of the Turkish daily &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot;, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was allegedly a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
It is in a reasoned way that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration to the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a story of success.
Reports from some Turkish media are like a slap in the face: &quot;Germany&#39;s gift for the fiftieth anniversary&quot; is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - &quot;Haber X&quot;, which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also the German publication of the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not hesitate to draw unambiguous conditions.
&quot;It&#39;s starting to stink&quot;, is the title of Ahmet Külahci&#39;s column.
He points out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived very critically on German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it did not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to carry out research in certain suspicious circles of the far right, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: &quot;If the affair continues to be sloppy, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and armament&quot;.
&quot;it will be the best self-defense&quot;.
&quot;Inner peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of information and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network&quot;, writes &quot;Selen&quot;.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made it clear.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what distrust and distance through acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was above all the failure of German policy after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how of taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burden.
The current Turkish media report once again shows how deep mistrust many German-Turks have had towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
Lake Zürich&#39;s scandal bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and is now slipping from crisis to crisis.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it became known in July that in 2013 he would occupy an almost equally spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, hailed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved solidity and passed on kind comments to future colleagues.
&quot;UBS has passed the Turnaround&quot;.
&quot;I look forward to the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;.
And yet, from the month of September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank&#39;s security systems and burned around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the UBS board of directors Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been considered unwell - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship already in May - not in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and President of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
Suddenly he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since deserved the title of &quot;the biggest scandal bank in Europe&quot;.
Indeed, UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently it was the biggest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS was managing on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from affluent clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich says: &quot;I always took UBS as a model of a good bank in front of my students.&quot;
&quot;From today&#39;s perspective, one wonders: how could I have simply been so wrong?&quot;
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it became apparent that for the first time something was wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, chairman Peter Wuffli surprisingly retired, who until then had been considered a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later we sensed why he left.
The bank division had been inflamed with sub-prime documents and had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of 13 billion francs and gave up on it.
For this it did indeed find investors, but who, a short time before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed over in silence, to the point that we never even learned his name.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to again announce losses amounting to billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, retired.
In October 2008 disaster followed: UBS was, due to its investment mistakes, in financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - as it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS in 2007 amounted to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
&quot;We couldn&#39;t save UBS again,&quot; says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of wealthy clients, who had evaded taxes perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of 780 million dollars - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
So UBS has more or less published that it has assisted in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the removal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus the bank had lost in a few months its credibility in the two main sectors of business: the banking investment because of bad speculations and the management of assets because of the aid to tax evasion.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as we thought, that UBS would come out of it, there followed this unfortunate story of title dealers: a single title dealer flames 1, 7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking, it still doesn&#39;t seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk management has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the financial director of a large German bank is sure: &quot;the problem of UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand.&quot;
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long since assumed their function, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for the money - and the world might well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it&#39;s only a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany&#39;s can be found here among the traditional Swiss shops, as are those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You arrive in the entrance hall of UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are clad in marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank&#39;s logo, a large label for &quot;safe.&quot;
UBS knows what clients are looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another driven out of the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS would have become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would have moreover spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say about it.
&quot;And even so, they have long since adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle like the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “The Crash of UBS”.
With up to around 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, the politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three big Swiss banks concluded together a huge group.
A bank was founded, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and has steadily grown.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of UBS supplemented: a rich, but lethargic bank with a strong asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but admittedly already more strongly internationalized bank. .
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board of directors.
&quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,&quot; says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the modest, tall intellectual, who is very good at models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who worked his way to the top with his apprenticeship in banking.”
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: &quot;He thought his models were reality&quot;, says Geiger.
&quot;It&#39;s a tragic fall.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the downfall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group always uttered the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the &quot;League Tables&quot; rankings, which at that time documented the success of Banks.
After all, UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already worked for him.
In matters of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisers, who had the responsibility, pointed out a weakness, however: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in American sub-prime investments that have invested.
It morphed into a massive machine that packaged and smuggled valuable documents based on US mortgages – but also retained risk.
Even when other banks had long sought to descend.
“Still in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was in flames, UBS bought there,” says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than expected.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far wobbly.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to come up with a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking must atrophy vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss-Italian was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank surprisingly parted ways with his predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he must sustainably manage the affairs of UBS, the Bank of Zurich communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring investment banking back to where it was in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won&#39;t be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she ?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He has so far only publicly stated that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe at the end of the week discouraged American investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The suppressed industrial production on the continent has dashed hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only last week half full, not half empty - but now the problems are once again pressing to the fore, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially financial stocks were on the sell sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index noted at the close of trading a loss of about 0.6% to 12,078 points.

In Frankfurt, the Dax ended with a drop of 1.2% to 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 countries of the euro zone has sharply reduced its production and adjusted to the end of the recovery.
As announced by the statistics office Eurostat, companies produced in September, 2% less than in the month before.
American investors expressed themselves in a skeptical way: &quot;We are not an island, on the other hand dependent&quot;, declared Steve Goldman of Goldman management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, only confirmed this caution: &quot;it is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis&quot;, he said in an interview at CNBC.
Therefore, in his view, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle to the winds and entered America&#39;s tech industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of this traditional group, and allowed it to note almost more than 1%, against the trend of commercial management.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.

Clever crows are spreading through cities
In many places, rooks are considered a &quot;bird problem&quot;.
Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as fast as possible. The crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities complaints from residents are mounting over the filth and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the &quot;bird problem&quot; is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive rooks out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
The conservationists based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The use of chemical products in agriculture destroys more and more the traditional living spaces.
Hunting, arranging and felling typical brood trees made life difficult for the birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the massacre of crows in this region.
Critics found capturing the birds in traps and killing them with clubs particularly brutal.
“Normal eviction, eviction, is useless,” noted Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Destroying nests with pressurized water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;Animals are moving away, large colonies are dividing, and they&#39;re spreading out to other places.&quot;
Eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
&quot;We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.&quot;
The problem cannot be solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of eviction of animals with aversive conditioning and eye-catching offers, in order to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected &quot;info panels instead of chainsaws&quot; in order to establish completely different relationships with the: &quot;We can finally bear a pimple in the face better with a dose of self-confidence. &quot;
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-educational-pathway of baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent rooks.
This project has meanwhile been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: &quot;That&#39;s a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other&quot;.
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: The rooks not only use working instruments to arrive at a treat but they make their own tools as working instruments.
Cambridge University ethologists were testing four rooks recently, just how smart the birds are.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to knock down a scaffolding with stones to get to a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone had to be of certain size and shape to bring down the platform.
In a second try, the crafty crows then had to solve a chunkier problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their spoils with their beaks.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket from the small pipe.
Three of the four rooks one succeeds even from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo pulls Portugal to European Championship 2012
Bosnian and Turkish hopes for a coup remained unfulfilled.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czechia and also Ireland will take part in the 2012 European championship.
Portugal, Czechia, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifiers for the 2012 European championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal lost against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and made their fifth appearance in the European championship perfect after the 0-0 match.
The Czechs reached the second leg through Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first leg (2:0) had already been obvious.
Nothing was also hotter in the 0:0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a break 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in qualifying for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick from 30 yards ahead into the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his ability to shoot from distance and shot from a distance of 25 meters to make it 2-0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour did not achieve anything, got their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a header ball directed below the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek fired a goal for the Czech
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding took center stage.
After an attack against Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the counter side, Stark awarded a controversial hand-played 11-yard penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek&#39;s team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had their greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation from the penalty area just wide of Cech&#39;s shot.
After the break, the crossbar had to come to the aid of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs already shot down, once again, the FC Seoul striker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey were missing out on Zagreb&#39;s footballing miracle meanwhile.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the third bench of EM 2002 in the same way, the Croats could enjoy their fourth round in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long range shot only the post, striker Kazim Kazim couldn&#39;t even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn&#39;t let anything burn.
Apart from VfL Wolfsburg&#39;s Mario Mandzukic, who was replaced by Dortmund&#39;s Ivan Perisic in the 62 nd Minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the pitch.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the MI since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a 4:0 success in the first leg for a preliminary decision in the 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the visitors.
Ireland pushed into high gear early on but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy&#39;s Robbie Keane was given the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian defense was able to prevent a possible goal from the first goalscorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and squeezed the ball down the line for 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe&#39;s largest software company, SAP, intends to invest billions in China over the next few years and will nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, around two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be awarded, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
&quot;We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,&quot; CEO Bill McDermott announced to clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from approximately 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of SAP&#39;s 176,000 global customers are located in this growing country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group&#39;s Strategy 2015.
SAP plans to increase turnover bis 2015 to 20 billion euros.

The Personal Mass Slaughter
Peter Englund&#39;s new book offers depth and generosity. Titled &quot;The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War&quot;, it begins with a long list of characters that will make your heart ache.
A tip for getting started: Tear up this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic tale by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an extraordinary book here which he accurately describes as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;
It features some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussion of strategies and materials.
It&#39;s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a &quot;book of what it could have been like&quot;. It includes &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and Sorrow&quot; encapsulates the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to rock climbers, doctors, paramedics and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Others prisoners of war. Some will lose limbs, go mad or lose their lives.
Their lives flicker here like candles in a church: as some go out, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund&#39;s book departs from traditional history books.
He brings a denial to the idea according to which the First World War can be summed up only by the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
&quot;Beauty and Sorrow&quot; skillfully depicts other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under beehives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When cannons sound in the distance, and you&#39;re a stay-at-home mom, do you stay or do you run?
Who&#39;s coming anyway?
Hardly anyone can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, &quot;the lack of facts has been fleshed out with guesses, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and Sorrow&quot; follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mostly drawn from memoirs, letters, and other previously published material.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or thrilling, but are most preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and coping.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: &quot;Ersatz, everywhere ersatz.&quot;
&quot;Substitute coffee, faux aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons.&quot;
He is suing on replacement food in Germany.
He describes &quot;meat made from cooked rice mashed in mutton fat (and finished off with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skin; shoe soles made of drink.&quot;
It claims that &quot;837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees.&quot;
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and says of the war: &quot;You feel that after all that is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in your hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such polish is synonymous with civilization, and that there are no barbarians behind your starched and studded shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and no one will notice or pay attention.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice oneself, one hopes to have an audience” he writes.
It is unfortunately rather comparable to &quot;a condemned man strangled in secret&quot;.
Other observations relate to the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
&quot;The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition&quot; writes Peter Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot;
He seizes on the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species within the bestiary of the turn of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-tailored clothes, who performs his butchery while seated behind a counter .&quot;
People act in unexpected ways; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
&quot;The most grotesque expression is found in the trade in gonorrhea pus, which soldiers buy and smear on genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital,&quot; he wrote.
&quot;The most desperate apply it to the eyes, resulting in lifelong blindness.&quot;
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund&#39;s prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war “unleashed forces that were uniquely uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion.”
People are beginning to wonder why their rulers are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as &quot;Great War and Modern Memory&quot; by Paul Fussel, or &quot;In the West nothing new&quot;, by Erich Maria Remarque , rather than complete.
Peter Englund&#39;s book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most damning I have read in a non-fiction work.
I will not reveal it.
But it&#39;s as if he had come out of his book, grabbed this page with the list of people from your hands and burned it with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be very empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the start that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence underscoring the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could not be repeats of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which went against department regulations and spawned a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was rolled out after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared by observing the unfolding of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall&#39;s Island, in preparation for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that involve quickly moving large numbers of police - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move around the park came &quot;at the last minute&quot;, said a regular, referring to the operation as &quot;just a drill&quot;.
&quot;The few police officers I know who were called didn&#39;t know they were going to Zuccotti Park,&quot; the person said on condition of anonymity.
&quot;The only ones who know they would go there are at the top of the police department.&quot;
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were turned away by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday&#39;s operation involved officers from various police units, including task forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers familiar with particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said many people came and went through the park during the day, like migrants. One o&#39;clock in the morning was therefore an auspicious time.
&quot;It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the fewest people,&quot; he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before responding.
Lights and recorded messages blaring from loudspeakers seemed to intimidate protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park wearing their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their things and left.
No tent was hit until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other teams of police were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the Chief of the Police Department, said the action was taken solely for safety.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly restrained by the officers.
Mr Browne said TV camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture footage.
As Police moved west through the thick jumble of protesters&#39; belongings, including luggage, plastic turf and leaf bags full of clothing, Sanitation Department crews followed, clearing everything the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged out. The images were released on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took up position near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the Police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr Kelly said.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for &quot;disturbing public order and rebellion&quot;.
Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of the Police Department, is the highest ranking officer to be on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although present, &quot;was not directing the operations&quot; Mr Browne said.
A second group of police waited along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case any intervention was needed.
Barricades were put up on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street to the south.
We saw the Police widen the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the liveliest actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police cruiser. Others were seen slashing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came flying out of the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of school aides sues the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school aides who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs. The impact is disproportionate on schools with disadvantaged pupils.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, in an attempt to have the layoffs overturned.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7th. Union leaders likened the layoffs to political revenge for not letting the city access a health care fund run by labor groups that would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that closed in June.
A council member fired back, saying the layoffs of school aides weren&#39;t specified in the budget in any way.
37th District Council officers said they would file a Notice of Claim, warning the Education Department that he would be sued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuits in Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city Department of Education will serve as the defendant. Plaintiffs will be represented by eight terminated workers, all of whom are black or of Latino descent, like most school aides who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokeswoman for the city&#39;s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to draft complaints obtained by The New York Times, the union is banking on the number of layoffs at schools in the city&#39;s poorest neighborhoods to bolster its claim of unfair treatment, saying poorer schools will lose out. the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school aides lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts. south Bronx neighborhoods.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aides employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of school children live in poverty, the lawsuits say, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of well-to-do parents who can raise funds for fill the budget gap.
Public School 36&#39;s budget was cut by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also says high school principals may have been misled by certain language in a memo authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term &quot;overrun&quot; to describe the action, although &quot;overrun&quot; more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the Complaints Project, “sixty-six parent coordinators were terminated,” and “not just for overspending.”
Mission accomplished: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
It would finally seem that the Republicans and the Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the question of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and US involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the people Libyan for their revolt and the American troops for their &quot;courage&quot;.
&quot;This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; said John Kerry.
&quot;It&#39;s bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot;
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been straightforward until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the wording of several resolutions aimed at whether to approve a US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and never received a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to cut funding for US operations in Libya.
The US mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress upset enough to criticize Obama&#39;s handling of the mission, but not enough to pull the rug out from under him.
Congressional indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution &quot;commends the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and determination in pursuit of freedom&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the United States armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.&quot;
The resolution also affirms &quot;the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide lawmakers like it did last June?
Senator and Commission Chairman Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had yet to read the very latest version of New Project.
In the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other matter, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but not without trying.
Goodlatte&#39;s amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring – the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate – and others are slight variations on precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House alone of the balanced budget amendment, and another handful that would “control federal spending.”
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - especially new Republicans who wish to gild their resumes - the chance to brag about being the &quot;author&quot; of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August required the House and Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be struck down if two-thirds of the states object.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as in the past.
During the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 during the 110th.
The pace is slowing from the early 1990s, when members typically proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
&quot;Massacred but not beaten&quot; says Gabrielle Giffords in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her at close range in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared Monday night on a TV show, sang Broadway&#39;s &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said he wanted to recover first rather than return to Congress.
While appearing on ABC&#39;s &quot;20/20&quot; newscast alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult comeback following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, going through his head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text relating to the debt ceiling.
In her first TV interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery &quot;difficult&quot;.
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied &quot;pretty good&quot;.
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of &#39;20/20&#39;, which aired the day before the release of the couple&#39;s new book, &#39;Gabby : a story of courage and hope&quot;.
The special traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, we see him on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
Months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A nod.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: &quot;What&quot;.
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (&quot;Toast&quot;) asking to change her breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords&#39; recovery: the Rep is seen singing along with doctors to Cyndi Lauper&#39;s tune &#39;Girls Wanna Have Fun&#39; and Tom Petty&#39;s &#39;Free Fallin&#39; ?&quot;.
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said she had no recollection of the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article to her about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and for the first time asked for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri jail and being vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
&quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot;
Upon her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said &quot;I was beaten.&quot;
&quot;So I would say, &#39;Gabby, you haven&#39;t been beaten,&#39;&quot; Mark Kelly said.
You were just slaughtered.
And you&#39;re going to pull through, recover, and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City&#39;s homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in suits and ties rose to their feet to cheer him on.
“Service men and women are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, spring fundraiser organizer.
A senior military official at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, the United States Army Chief of Staff, saw the role of the troops differently.
&quot;They were presented as some sort of orphan,&quot; the senior military officer wrote in an email.
I&#39;m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know it.
But it was not respect. Just pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praises are lavished on the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a price, say some soldiers.
The public increasingly acts as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
&quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
&quot;But it seems the only way to sustain us is to lock us into the role of unlucky spirits.&quot;
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of returning troops from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place in secrecy among veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that the public would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look upon them with awe as they faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if &quot;an angry and violent veteran lurks beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt a few people interviewing him were subtly asking if he would be able to hold up under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately afterward. his return from combat.
“When you bring up the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalls when talking to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely celebrated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way we did in World War II,&quot; said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, kudos from politicians and the common people largely focus on the depth of a serviceman&#39;s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
Army faces mounting pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a momentous hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will stand trial against the military for alleged inaction over rape.
If necessary, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the next one.
Private 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims she was raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she encountered a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It was a wake-up call,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan put her worries aside.
I thought: no, he is 19 years old.
&quot;He&#39;s from Texas,&quot; she said.
&quot;I should have followed my intuition.&quot;
Minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman&#39;s bedroom, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the floor and raped her, she claims.
This week, Nov. 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other service members, some still serving and some not, will anxiously await the court ruling in a landmark trial in Arlington, Va., which will decide whether a trial against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rapes within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 in the following months – 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares to attack the laced soldiers, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
“Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders.&quot;
The lawyer also says that since February she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Instead of rounding up all the plaintiffs in this case — thus putting all her eggs in one basket — she will file multiple lawsuits, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by US attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the strategy of the defense, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be sued by serving or non-serving soldiers for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
&quot;The alleged harm is inherent in the plaintiffs&#39; military service,&quot; the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially barred from fighting, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely all-male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in establishing contact with local women.
Result: in these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in a combat situation.
It&#39;s time for the military to modernize says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic vibe.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of &quot;personality disorders&quot; attributed to the victims of the rapes in order to give them leave - a fact relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women&#39;s Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way they handle claims for benefits for people who say they were sexually assaulted on the service.
Nine independent bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense&#39;s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, by the Pentagon&#39;s own estimate, that figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also looks at the percentage of cases brought to trial: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the military went to trial - half the percentage in the civilian justice system.
Plaintiffs in Susan Burke&#39;s case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman&#39;s case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the fact.
That night, she said, she was asked to recount her rape in detail 11 times to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a &quot;rape kit&quot; (literally a rape kit), and her attacker&#39;s blood - from a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits before a judge in a trial where she is questioned about having sex with her boyfriend earlier the day of her assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day the verdict was given,&quot; says Elizabeth Lyman.
&quot;I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started yelling at court.&quot;
&quot;I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, &#39;It was not his trial but mine&#39;.&quot;
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was fired on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Whether or not Lyman and the other plaintiffs&#39; case will move forward is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he points out, &quot;In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.&quot;
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction stands between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by accountability.
&quot;The odds are heavily stacked against them...but it&#39;s important that they try,&quot; he added.
These things only change when the good guys have the will to fight.
If the lawsuit does not turn out in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs&#39; attorney, will round up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials.
&quot;We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform,&quot; she said.
Where until we die, either of two options.
The walls have eyes: Researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been seized with a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time leading up to the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme groups. right on social networking sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Connect to Facebook.
&quot;We realized it wasn&#39;t that hard to track them down,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is packed with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that searchers could simply use the site&#39;s advertising tool to find the people they&#39;re looking for with scientific precision - the way marketers have done for years.
Jamie Bartlett&quot;s team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to complete a survey, which asked questions about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
&quot;It&#39;s a new way of doing research,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be male, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, &quot;those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.&quot;
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new go-to tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to research everything from health issues to social trends through likes, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, the &quot;data supernova&quot; is generating a search explosion, increasing the number of search jobs with the site&#39;s name appearing in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn&#39;t approach on the street.
&quot;Before, when you tried to carry out surveys on people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;You had to go to the party, but they would never let you in,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook avoids all of that - you have direct access to their information.&quot;
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were significantly more likely to be alcoholics than college students. discrete about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that co-workers of students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status too often mentions alcohol.
&quot;You can&#39;t treat a problem if you don&#39;t diagnose it,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children&#39;s Research Institute located in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
&quot;We know how to identify children at risk, who would otherwise go unrecognized.&quot;
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site&#39;s data team studied statistics for love status and Valentine&#39;s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections and a National Happiness Index (using information only available - champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site can make its treasure trove of data available to others for research).
But Facebook users know the site is watching them whether they like it or not — in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is granted access to your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven&#39;t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to gather information other than through the Internet, online is a whole different story.
&quot;I don&#39;t think a lot of users have ever thought about a researcher looking at their profile,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Knowledge Lab in London, based on a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
&quot;As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends.&quot;
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,&quot; says Neil Selwyn.
That&#39;s why, despite his background as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen are still the best tools anyone can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
&quot;Social studies is supposed to be about the social aspect - and the social is not in front of a computer.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighter when he first appeared at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Templars of Norway,” he explains to a courtroom filled with 500 people.
&quot;As for the jurisdiction of the tribunal, I challenge it, because you hold your mandate from organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I admit the facts but I do not plead guilty.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he &quot;didn&#39;t want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions.&quot;
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, speak to the victims&#39; parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another twelve weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would monitor all visits and correspondence very closely for eight weeks.
Around 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
“I found him cold and inhuman,” a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian television channel NRK.
&quot;I was not comfortable, but I personally moved on a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot;
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked reporters and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of court.
Despite the odd idea that Breivik belongs to a broad &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge determined he was not crazy. He also said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But that does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
&quot;I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn&#39;t,&quot; said a relative of one victim.
&quot;It would have been much easier.&quot;
7 lessons from Steve Jobs&#39; lost interview, in theaters this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most telling in a recently found interview with Steve Jobs, which will premiere this week as the opening act for a film in major markets, is how well this creative mind understood the processes and product workflow.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flow chart improver - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from a &quot;disease that makes them think a great idea does 90% of the work...[but] a considerable amount of manual labor separates a great idea from a great product.&quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;. This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare chat.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already hard at work on his new computer venture NeXT, aiming for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the Cringely interview is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies disappeared in transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video was found in the director&#39;s garage.
This video, slightly edited, is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in theaters next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about expounding on technology philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments where Steve Jobs&#39; perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely&#39;s questions, nudging him to get him to speed up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is an oddly prescient aspect to Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad about other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It&#39;s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs&#39; career, but there&#39;s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then puts them into action.
Here&#39;s a quick recap of seven standout sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
&quot;Through all these years, I&#39;ve always asked, &#39;Why do you do things?&#39; and the answers are constantly the same: &#39;oh, just because they have to be done.&#39;&quot;
Nobody knows why, nobody really thinks things through in a business.
That&#39;s what I discovered.
Steve Jobs goes on to elaborate on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; estimated at a glance, then adjusted with a &quot;variation&quot; - he developed an automated factory that ensured the accurate calculation of business costs.
On whether to play a trick on the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the &quot;Blue Box&quot; he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and make free long-distance calls.
The device has been written about extensively before, but Steve Jobs&#39; euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is infectious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a payphone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&amp;T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
&quot;We would wrap the ball in different things half a dozen times and you would yell into the payphone and it would come to you a minute later at the payphone next door,&quot; Jobs explains with a laugh.
&quot;We were young and through this Blue Box we learned that we ourselves could create something capable of controlling billions of dollars worth of infrastructure worldwide.&quot;
We didn&#39;t know much together, but we knew how to invent a small thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don&#39;t believe Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to recount a wonderful trick he and Wozniak hatched: He phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices burst out laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and canvassing Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looks up Bill Hewlett&#39;s number in the phone book and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute chat, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated.&quot;
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company&#39;s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered &quot;the first desktop computer ever.&quot;
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube. I fell in love with it.
As a teenager I went back to HP and started writing programs for that machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
At the start of his career, when he was settling down to sell a few printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working with only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember big fights…being yelled at me saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had had enough, walked out and went to see a designer. &quot;
Ninety days later, we had a mouse we could make for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
On big companies running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?&quot;
You have a monopoly on the market, so the business is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can scale it, so [these are the types of people] who end up running the businesses and the product-focused staff are left out of the decision-making.
The genius in product that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can&#39;t imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times her current height. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
&quot;A huge amount of manual labor separates a great idea from a great product...as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about its intricacies.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can&#39;t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It&#39;s about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you&#39;re creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
That&#39;s part of what makes the Macintosh exceptional. The people working on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done amazing things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents as court meets
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive issue of whether opposition to President Obama&#39;s health care law will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases in question involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, legislation that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges have agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental 5:30 argument is expected next March, and the outcome is likely to further destabilize the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court&#39;s decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue the bill&#39;s rejection is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as US Solicitor General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement&#39;s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was among two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a longtime group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter has been pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference in the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, top Republican in the Senate and declared opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at Federalist Society events for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt be arguing by Canon&#39;s code 4C, which states: &quot;A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or appearing on the program of such an event&quot;.
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial stake, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
&quot;The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court.&quot;
Their presence and participation in fundraising for this event disproves any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who claim they too easily mix court business with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas&#39; wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as solicitor general for the Obama administration when the first challenges to the law were brought to the trial court level.
Her critics pressed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case, saying she was too invested in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing signs record $18 billion order for airliners
Emirates airline is ordering 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal estimated at over $1 billion.
It&#39;s nothing out of the ordinary for a company to receive an order for 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is quite a business when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing goldmine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released on Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced the most expensive commercial jet order in its history - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777s.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai which placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more planes, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing reported on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger amenities.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
&quot;It&#39;s clearly very positive for Boeing,&quot; said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
&quot;These customers in particular are of immense value.&quot;
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore not only have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to the airlines because it represents their biggest expense - would not be so detrimental to them since the country would gain money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their plane orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
&quot;They have a natural risk hedge,&quot; he said.
The Emirates order reinforces Boeing&#39;s dominance in the wide-body aircraft market and helps curb rival Airbus&#39; attempted encroachment with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing&#39;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced to postpone the debut of the larger version of the A350, which directly competes with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus postpones its debut to increase its thrust following the request of its customers to increase its load capacity and its autonomy.
Boeing Company shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president&#39;s sister obviously beaten in Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon&#39;s sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán in a violent election, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of the western state.
&quot;The intervention of organized crime during the entire voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country&quot;, reported Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote&quot; for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he&#39;s planning his comeback, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have edged only a little ahead of Calderon, who was leading in the polls heading into Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother&#39;s conservative Parti Action Nationale, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the initial results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon&quot;s home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many local candidates withdrew from the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as Michoacán&#39;s elections look, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, &quot;I think this victory is very encouraging for next year.&quot;
AsDB urges Asia to come to the aid of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro zone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world&#39;s two fastest-growing economic powers must &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He cautioned the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) against looking at Europe&#39;s difficulties with an &quot;indifferent eye&quot; and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe&#39;s leaders and resources would to avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy.
&quot;We are all together in this crisis.&quot;
&quot;So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
&quot;Asia can be protected up to a point but it is not immune.&quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them.&quot;
In recent months, the euro zone has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy is sliding into recession, and prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag presaged that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that such bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the United States&#39; financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - offered greater leverage. negotiations with Europe&#39;s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India&#39;s trade and industry minister, said &quot;India will do all it can&quot; to help the euro zone as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
&quot;Nobody wants the euro zone to remain unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.
&quot;We have monumental challenges ahead and we must maintain a high level of growth.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not a choice, it&#39;s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?&quot;
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help wealthy Europeans as they face their own significant economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid for the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2. per day, or even less.
“One day they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why India&#39;s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek civil servants in badly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to cause &quot;significant spillovers&quot; across Asia.
ADB forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face &quot;downside risks&quot; from the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop &quot;backup plans&quot; to protect themselves from an economic downturn and major capital outflows.
Stern warnings from the Pentagon on potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ratcheted up the pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It has set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan to the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
&quot;The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach a budget deal resulting in what is known as sequestration, would result in 23% cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
&quot;Such a large reduction, applied indiscriminately in this way, would render most of our ships and construction projects unworkable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other modernization,&quot; Panetta wrote to senators.
&quot;We would also be forced to part ways with a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to meet the target.&quot;
&quot;These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparedness.&quot;
The cuts would eventually affect combat troops, Panetta continues.
“While wartime funding of overseas contingency operations accounts would not be directly impacted by sequestration, wartime efforts would be adversely affected by severe disruptions in base budgets,” Panetta warned.
&quot;Contracting staff would be reduced, causing delays in contracts and contract oversight that support the war.&quot;
&quot;Staff managing salaries would be reduced, causing delays in payments to war contractors, and legal and policy support would be disrupted.&quot;
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
&quot;The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader in military might.&quot;
“We strongly oppose this drastic action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta&#39;s letter was released.
&quot;It&#39;s not a consequence we can live with, and it&#39;s certainly not one we should impose on ourselves.&quot;
&quot;Forcible confinement is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it shouldn&#39;t have to happen.&quot;
Whether Panetta&#39;s letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, even as he rose to the Pentagon&#39;s top job himself, accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might come - a military with a shell, but no core.
&quot;It is a ship without sailors&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s a brigade without bullets&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don&#39;t have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,&quot; Panetta said during his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
&quot;It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;De facto, it invites aggression..&quot;
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically set out how further reductions could &quot;create significant operational risks: delays in responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations&quot;.
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could be cut, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, next-generation ballistic submarine, new littoral combat ship and new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its proponents say it&#39;s an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and others rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how pervasive deception and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has come across as an idiot by quickly issuing denials that are contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to his coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, no one who has lived through history will ever forget the media circus President Bill Clinton started by lying in his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Accounts of cheating on school and college tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave test answers to students in order to look good on their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we encounter?
On any given day, studies show you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are white lies.
Another study showed that strangers lie to each other three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone should acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game akin to, say, charades, where the objective is to shout out, &quot;I got you&quot;, deception detection is a serious branch of science-based knowledge. collected over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don&#39;t always stutter, blush or fidget.
Do not conclude that liars are hard to detect and hard to unmask.
A trained lie detector can uncover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years reviewing scientific findings in the vast and still emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are adept at reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more &quot;self-focused&quot; lies while women tell more &quot;other-focused&quot; lies - usually to protect someone&#39;s feelings. one - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are seen as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty for lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called &quot;establishing benchmarks&quot;.
This helps provide a benchmark against which to measure subsequent changes.
Observe your subject&#39;s posture, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally wiggles their feet all the time so you don&#39;t make unfair accusations when you see them wiggling their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and non-verbal deceptive behavior.
Treat these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Cheating people may immobilize their upper body when trying to remember their story, they may point their feet out the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit &quot;post-interview&quot; relief. - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all the difficult questions are over.
Interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject&#39;s vocabulary.
The notorious Scott Peterson went off the rails using the past while pretending his murdered wife was alive, sparking a nationwide search to find her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distanced language: &quot;I haven&#39;t had sex with this woman...Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of &quot;wooden language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well...to tell the truth...if I remember correctly...to my knowledge.&quot;
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for lie detection, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone&#39;s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan will be rerouted after threat of late US approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it&#39;s ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska Dunes, and is confident the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department&#39;s announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to Avoid areas of the Nebraska Dunes and the Ogallala Aquifer, vast underground water sources.
&quot;It&#39;s a real way forward,&quot; Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have pushed back any decision until 2013, after next year&#39;s election, although officials deny politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department&#39;s decision, and expressed his support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, he would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for legislation to force the area away from the Sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking and irrigation water.
The State Department&#39;s ongoing environmental impact assessment found the project would pose only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department&#39;s inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, centered on two questions.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a Hillary Clinton campaign adviser in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing young child to vomit in fear
A New York family say disco diva Patti LaBelle launched into a rampage in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building, terrified their baby girl to the point where she threw up in fear.
The &#39;Lady Marmalade&#39; singer&#39;s tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered &#39;personality changes, sleep disturbances&#39; and &#39;increased fear of strangers&#39;, says her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk went to get the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and said, &#39;Do you know what your daughter is doing?&#39; I said &#39;yes&#39; and went to get her,&quot; she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
&quot;She told me in an aggressive tone, &#39;You shouldn&#39;t leave your daughter near the door,&#39; Roseanna Monk says.
&quot;I answered him: &#39;what you say or think does not interest me.
She became enraged and started using swear words - the word &quot;&quot; and the word &quot;&quot; in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to spray me with water from the bottle.
She stated that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
&quot;I said to this woman, &#39;Look what you did to my daughter,&#39; the child&#39;s mother said.
LaBelle threw herself on the mom - who was still holding Genevieve in her arms - and had to be restrained by those around her who dragged her to a waiting car, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
The family later sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle&#39;s attorney and representatives did not return our calls for comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family&#39;s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and the family plans to donate any money received to charity against the cancer for children.
&quot;The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.&quot;
Climate adversity has dampened the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez&#39;s management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it was the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled of change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, aside from causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state&#39;s economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the frost damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 million 835 cultivated hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest 21. 07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate of the state during the first three quarters of the year an accelerated increase was observed, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand unemployed Sinaloans, an increase compared to the first semester of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
&quot;What we observe is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering. money, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way, it&#39;s not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and use them in something,&quot; he said.
Detained Migration
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
&quot;The number of people who leave the state to work abroad in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when entering they already have a lot of difficulty finding of work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work there, which causes unemployment to rise,&quot; he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in this state works there without contributing as worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the lag for the state is the low salaries, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the IED of the State reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent regarding the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.280 billion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, in July the State Government requested from the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no benefit of indebtedness was observed in any sector of the economy of the state.
reactions
For the representatives of the business sector, the first year of government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
&quot;The performance of Sinaloa&#39;s economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we have lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the efforts of all and above all the already synchronized good progress of this new team of Government, let&#39;s hope that next year will be much better&quot;, he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts at the start of the year held back the state&#39;s economy and restricted its performance and growth.
&quot;The low economic flow is the product of several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn quickly enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations we had,&quot; he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers&#39; Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa declared that one wants to channel the State towards productive activities of more dynamism.
&quot;In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and the economic direction of the State, because it is important that we detonates the full potential of Sinaloa&#39;s material and human resources,&quot; he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex underlined the importance of establishing a vision of the future which better channels the Government&#39;s efforts.
&quot;In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program&quot;, declared- he.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in the way of managing public policy.
&quot;There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do&quot; , he said.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marihuana
A resident of Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100 day fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Republic has informed that the convicted small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offense against health, in its variant of possession of marihuana intended for sale.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The little trafficker was traveling in a pick-up type van, white in color, in which he was carrying a black bag in the luggage rack of the vehicle and on the co-pilot&#39;s place a small backpack in which the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Center for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Offenses.
Debts to contributions to works
The works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes risk not being finished or registering serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, pointed out Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the construction programs have progressed, they are in a situation of risk, because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
&quot;They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end they haven&#39;t given us anything, although since July they were to give us part of it&quot;, he says, &quot;and we, for not register any delays, we have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money&quot;.
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided on that occasion.
&quot;We had already suffered this in the previous sexennial period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year we, in order to be able to have access to these programs, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid,&quot; he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the state authorities to provide these resources, he declared that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finances, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements for that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
&quot;They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven&#39;t given us anything.&quot;
The Court validates &quot;the analog cut&quot; in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogical signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the last years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree which advances the so-called &quot;analog cut&quot; from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary for the &#39;invalidate have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree which details the actions to be taken to make the transition a reality. on digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, because the regulation in the matter of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission ( Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favor of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree and admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions foreseen by it for the digital transformation.
The plenary session of the ministers resolved to reject also the complaint formulated by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which the minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general norms the measures so that the public administration prepare for it.
&quot;Nor do I consider that if he did so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected&quot;, and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the &#39;Federal executive, which has the constitutional mandate of running the state.
The substitution of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization which involves a decision of public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, &quot;because it also includes economic, social, political and national security&quot;.
These issues, he stressed, &quot;require the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive to the state&quot;.
He recalled that a large number of countries all over the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in any way the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured .
We analyze the possibility of a &quot;vote by vote&quot; count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of &quot;vote by vote&quot; counting is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, last November 9, the electoral body approved a series guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not approve either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal term. for this electoral process to enter into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided for by the Law of the Official Gazette of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the state agent for the constitutional reforms, because he has no right to &quot;sanction or challenge&quot; them.
Interviewed on the possibility of &quot;vote by vote&quot;, María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counts of the votes by the body local election.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it is possible that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of the ballot and count in the file of the ballot box is not with the president thereof; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate presumed winner of the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the ballot is equal or below a point of percentage; whenever at the beginning of the session an express petition of the representative of the party and/or coalition exists that presented/displayed the second of the indicated candidates.
The total count of the vote can also be carried out if at the end of the common count it turns out that the difference between the supposed winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, in which case the electoral packages that were subject to the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the total 923 minutes.

Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authorities presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for offenses relating to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered with shots fired in different parts of the body and with the final blow, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at kilometer 1.5 of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.

A meter away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were lying face down.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because casings were not found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were callouts directed by one organized crime group towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the gate.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government which will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and jeopardized the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will assume his post.
Monti said he would present to the president the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
&quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country&#39;s ability to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The &quot;framework is now well drawn&quot;, he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in less than normal time, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, market volatility pushed the yield on Italy&#39;s 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level Greece and Ireland must have been at. saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers&#39; association Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: &quot;We said that we would support this government a lot&quot;.
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti&#39;s chances of success have been boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi&#39;s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
&quot;We believe that Professor Monti&#39;s efforts will have a good result,&quot; Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
Monti&#39;s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups and youth and women&#39;s organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who empowered an extremely quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italy&#39;s debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before bringing the elections forward.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, a sign of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate trying to include political figures.
The experience of Spaniards is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called up from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 called up has participated in 50 matches.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today&#39;s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium in San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA&#39;s monthly ranking, have a large record of class A inter-selection games, the Habs only have defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 games. international.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) over Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in the powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense year-round activity in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers for the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the greatest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (0-1 defense in London) equaled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Habs today and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral flyer of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke centre-forward Raúl González with 102.
Close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and next to Michael Umana are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The lessers.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn&#39;t even come to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not started yet.
Spain&#39;s historic goalscorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
&quot;Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready for one of their best shows next Sunday at National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to perform in this country.
That&#39;s what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is on the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour, and Sunday the 20th will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will present themselves at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m., next to the group from Los Angeles The X and the Nationals from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are going through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I&#39;ve only been to Costa Rica once on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it moves us to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion towards the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people are already saying that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does add a bit of pressure to your visit.
Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve offered in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We gave a gigantic two shows in Sao Paolo and hopefully that got us in shape for this show in Costa Rica.
We are really, really looking forward to performing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have lots of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that&#39;s how we learned it, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have given huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never performed there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What should this be?
I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine records and we can perform over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that&#39;s why it&#39;s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven&#39;t performed for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe how much you have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don&#39;t think any of us imagined that we were going to form a great rock band, and the fact that we&#39;ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and to be able to continue making music together is very emotional for us.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn&#39;t be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are great friends with the folks at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It&#39;s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
Once in a while, a band pops out of a town, but it&#39;s much weirder when five or ten bands pop out of the same town at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we&#39;re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it&#39;s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It&#39;s also very strange that a band like yours stays united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that&#39;s a lot longer than a lot of bands normally last.
First, I believe we are all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all close friends and because of that there are musical avenues that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other&#39;s music and it couldn&#39;t get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don&#39;t spend too much time on tour because it&#39;s easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
If we don&#39;t forget that people are there for the music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without getting into the head of the fact that we is famous and a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn&#39;t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when i listen to a song or i see a picture i think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and a lot other things with him.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
National group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group that we liked the most, so we can&#39;t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&#39;t know.
He&#39;s the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge alive despite the fact that it&#39;s out of fashion?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time and, if it&#39;s relevant now, I think that&#39;s wonderful, because it is music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first his music had more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It&#39;s interesting, because I believe there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that qualify as very obscure songs, even though those may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and those are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there&#39;s trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even that way we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for loss of muscle strength in his magpies, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various ailments, including tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Special Operations Directorate of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people due to an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point in a long agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be &quot;conducive for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations&quot;, according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French proxy Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens in the meeting. of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude countries that continue to be tax havens from the international community, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations from its ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group formed by the strongest emerging and developed countries in the world, since November, and has in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to hurry the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the &quot;gri list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), included by countries that do not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes three-dimensional with &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;
Super Mario fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month to the stores of all the world, was designed from the beginning to exploit well the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
&quot;Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,&quot; said Nintendo&#39;s specialist press manager in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;Nintendo&#39;s first video game originally designed for this medium&quot;, since until now hits like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo&#39;s spokesperson maintained that, despite being in 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is an &quot;accessible&quot; video game that allows for fast and smooth gameplay.
Álvarez claimed that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to do a &quot;second round&quot; at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and &quot;not succumb to illusions optics&quot;.
This foray of Super Mario into three dimensions also supposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachioed plumber must cross platforms mined with perils to free Princess Peach.
Even if I player find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of &quot;playable&quot; Luigi.
Colom backs Portillo&#39;s extradition to US
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy to launder 70 million US dollars.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country which claimed Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom affirmed that his decision obeys the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He affirmed that during his mandate &quot;he had not helped&quot; in any judicial resolution and he had given course to all the extraditions that he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done assumes an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional instances to try the former agent of the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was cleared for embezzlement of Q120 million at the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the pre-extradition trial, but the Prosecution appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people with little education, without work, with drug addiction problems or marginalized.
Yesterday&#39;s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of heads of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Next to the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor and current Eco Municipal Councilor -socialist Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the general director of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the great hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in very difficult times and so are the current ones, but he added that the work done so far &quot;is a good basis&quot;.
The president gave Trinijove as an example of knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
&quot;The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,&quot; he said.
Property overrun with squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 Rue Balmes were living through has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned at noon yesterday the building they were illegally occupying and where they were organizing micro-parties that despaired the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
&quot;From this day on there will be access control&quot;, affirmed the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of that of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues there. of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of the property were doing her unfair competence, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had to respond to complaints from neighbors about noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house. and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which have been more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors in the area.
The manager of the nightclub explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he “forgave” her the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week &quot;the immediate evacuation of the building to put an end to the problems of coexistence and good citizenship that this caused to the residents and the degradation of the area&quot;.
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the past few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in some apartments there were flights too.
It is in this sense that he added that &quot;we must end with impunity and be implacable against the antisocial behavior generated in the property&quot;.
Also yesterday, the Mossos (local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 pm the police moved to number 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were entering the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the advisability of the summons beyond the controversy over the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York&#39;s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again became, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-eastern axis. south, otherwise high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park if not Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall called a mega-competition made up of 16 competitions for all the access doors to Collserola.
A gate brings back the park idea, definitely.
That&#39;s it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It&#39;s almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient chosen caste talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the rare opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who presented themselves there coincide.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front &quot;it is necessary to&quot; debate on &quot;the mountain front&quot; because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks of houses has not been completed.
&quot;You have to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex&quot;, gave the verdict the architect for whom the title of &quot;Doors of Collserola&quot; contains a &quot;lexical trap&quot;: these should not be thought of &quot;as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action is needed&quot;.
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some perils&quot;.
Perils that derive from &quot;the uncertainty of the projection of the public space&quot; after the experience lived in the 80s and which had in the area of the Forum &quot;its swan song&quot;.
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
&quot;To limit something means to already establish the next step&quot;, that is to say, its overcoming.
&quot;We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters&quot;.
Sticking more to the question, Modol opines that, simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region &quot;can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no&quot;.
Modol recalls that there is already work done by the Patronage of Collserola which &quot;must not be lost&quot;, thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project &quot;from the first moment&quot;.
In addition, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;quite a success&quot;, he says) that we had to create: &quot;We, the architects, should be only an instrument&quot;.
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition lack a global vision of Collserola: &quot;16 transversal competitions have been called - he says - in the mountain sense- sea, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole&quot;.
This makes, at least in this case, that he opted to participate in the 16 contests.
Alternatively, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the strip immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal attorney of Casino Red has granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the lawsuit initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal attorney of Casino Red grants him a pardon in the Second District Criminal Court, which is following a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic quota from him so that the mayor of Monterrey allowed the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the PANist mayor and on September 2, he was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before Public Prosecution Officer 3 of Patrimonial Offenses, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor dismissed the charges of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Penal Center of Cadereyta presumably for having blackmailed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; but he only spent a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial confined in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás&#39; guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to request a pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom within the next few hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and which of the associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to release the name.
By virtue of the file 197/2011 the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim can be made in relation to the lawsuit brought against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for damages and no punishment either.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the gambling house, at 3:50 pm the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate release that the judge has issued.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives communicates the details of the air accident in which lost his life the secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) has informed that the results evidenced on the accident in which lost his life the secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, indicate that the helicopter hit directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the takeoff of the airship, the pilot found that the climatic conditions were adequate to fly.
“Elements which seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage”.
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements necessary to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
&quot;In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in any other location, the impact presented structurally.
&quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground presented a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was operating at cruiser speed and it happened on soft ground ascending.
&quot;This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact,&quot; he said.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather situation:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions at takeoff, and as the aircraft progressed towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low cloudiness.
Selected routes:
It is probable that because of the cloudy conditions the crew sought an area of lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was neither loss of control nor alteration of the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The dispersion model of the aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter struck the ground in structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the location of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During fieldwork parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the ground had a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees inclination .
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a careful search in an area larger than the circled area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place. under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the &#39;Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity&#39; protocol, which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population with or without the right is invited to participate, to come to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the tests for minors are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8 the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent obesity. onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As November 14 will be celebrated as World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires relating to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays all participants will be given anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (the aim is to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
&#39;The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; as far as overweight is concerned, a dramatic increase has also been observed&#39;, underlined the IMSS specialist.
He said the rationale for searching for the markers is based on the fact that the country&#39;s population is different from others in its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African ancestry, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the integral evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they present a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they must carry out to prevent illnesses.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - corn flour meat pie wrapped in corn husks -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the reports that the cobblestone were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair around 200 thousand currants each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM , who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavement is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places in which the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore the formation of currants.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a collection of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give to the cobblestone its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state. , while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating forces, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, these would spread better, thought the chemical engineer.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, we put a last layer called wearing course, made of fine stone, that is to say, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the wearing course also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material of which it is made must be careful.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these greatly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the ground gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer and it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes blackcurrants.
In the process of formation of a currant, he says, the first thing that gets spoiled is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be attended to at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Researchers System explained that the vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of currants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the vehicle load and guarantee its satisfaction, for avoid the frequent formation of currants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow currants to be repaired easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did the de Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to obtain the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle receives her title number 14 of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content herself with being on the winners&#39; podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico ascended with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums up 14 titles of Princess and Melina one to a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation has demonstrated that she has everything to be the new Miss Colombia, since she was not elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the juror to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question &quot;What was the book that marked you and why?&quot; by Martín Murillo Gómez, from Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of candidate de Valle to this question:
&quot;I read a lot, I quite believe in literature, I believe it&#39;s a form of culturalizing oneself, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is &#39;The Little Prince&#39;, it&#39;s a fairly deep book.
Now I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I&#39;m reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called &quot;The Burning of Blood&quot;.
This answer did not please first of all because of the term &quot;to culturalize&quot; and secondly for not explaining concretely in what way each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the outcome &quot;universe and wise, what has to happen is happening.
And for everyone, please read a little, &quot;The little prince&quot; is a great book&quot;
Among the hypotheses launched there is that according to which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogotá insinuated that being the favourite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best handmade costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on the stage&quot;.
And it was noted in her first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and her two coronation eve runway shows.
Although at both parades she seemed confident, it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;Como en casa&quot; (Like at home), of Canal RCN declared that the fact that Melina had been designated princess &quot;confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most of the prizes during the contest does not receive not the queen&#39;s crown&quot;.
Also, Valle dodged the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That&#39;s why two days before the election the international juror Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
&quot;Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects&quot;, explained- She.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in her behind and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate &#39;Natural beauty&#39; with the body more healthy, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen groomer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina didn&#39;t have the best body, that there were better ones, &quot;but her fibrosis problem on her abdomen, which in reality for me hadn&#39;t been too noticeable, gave him points on the last day&quot;.
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgical interventions which she had undergone.
&quot;The surgeries are good, but Valle didn&#39;t know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.&quot;
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest is giving out for the first time, after the fashion show in a bathing suit, a cruel prediction arose which came true last night, it was said that it was a small gift from Raymundo to Melina for not giving her a taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
So was the work of the person from Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali fingerprinter has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &#39;Alfonso Cano&#39;.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4, a CTI dactyloscopist from Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprinters who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of &quot;availability&quot; of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in the field of forensic investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having taken adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big awaited him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the oldest guerrillas in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant from the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don&#39;t lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the corpse&#39;s fingerprints with those on the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the person in charge who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
In search of the footprint
For a fingerprinter from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot;, is very significant.
A lot of people don&#39;t know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science with no margin for error that can be crucial in solving crimes.
Aside from identifying dead bodies, fingerprinters support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When caught, many offenders present false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The researcher told that in a case of robbery he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had leaned his hand to extract a safe full of jewels and money.
&quot;The walls are difficult because they are not of adequate surface to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts&quot;, recalls -he.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently a man was found dead, with drink bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a parent may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a print on the bottle matched.
While this doesn&#39;t guarantee he&#39;s the killer, it puts him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that &quot;fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents&quot;.
When they appear, a sampler or strip is used to collect them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declines database, or to the National Civil Registry.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&quot; said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is how it is shown in the CSI television program.
As all that glitters is not gold, everything you touch does not necessarily become an imprint.
It can however be used, if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The &quot;outraged&quot; defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators jostled in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
Much of the people acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators jostled in front of Piazza Zuccotti, where they wanted to gain access thanks to a judicial order that allows the &#39;outraged&#39; to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
&quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations. “, says one of the spokespersons of the movement “Occupy Wall Street”, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the &#39;outraged&#39; response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made it all the way to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order barring the evacuation forced from the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the &#39;outraged&#39; have occupied a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, property of the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the Police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the concrete number, assuring Efe that he saw a few journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are centenarians of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned compound - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning&#39;s evacuation must be analyzed.
Some demonstrators who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of this judicial order at that time and they were even delivering it to the agents who were guarding the square, which caused &quot;some small clashes&quot;, said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing &#39;laws issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they previously used&#39;.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city has suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but alerted them that local laws do not allow them to s set up with tents and sleeping bags.
The town councilor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Piazza Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators were &#39;breaking the law&#39;.
Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming &quot;a place where people don&#39;t come to protest, but to break the law and in some cases to harm people. &#39;other people&#39;, because &#39;some stores had received threats&#39; and residents were afraid &#39;for their quality of life&#39;.
&quot;The evacuation this morning at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; added the movement&#39;s spokesperson, who accused the mayor of &quot; not respect freedom of expression&quot;.
&quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; officials also said they do not plan to organize &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas television program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear in the television program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen&#39;s assistant in &#39;Home Improvement&#39;, lifeguard in &#39;Baywatch&#39;, bunny in &#39;Playboy&#39;, wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside &quot;crooner&quot; Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will appear on the television program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1. interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot; drummer &quot;, Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary supporting a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian-Canadian comedian who recently performed part of Charlie Sheen&#39;s &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth,&quot; appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV&#39;s Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from controversies.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a &#39;bitch&#39; during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy had been paralyzed, still convalescing after the devastating earthquake which became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster for the Japanese country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses at 300,000 million dollars, a blow which, despite the difficult global context, seems to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page definitively: the GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
That recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - supposes, in addition, the greatest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus for the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse which invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan woke up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo went back to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the &quot;safe havens&quot; chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the uncertain forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of the big technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue their sieges in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower its guard.
“We must monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates inflection points in the global economy highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it fell four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in the 100 level, n dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens fuels doubts again
Papadimos says tweaks will be approved, but curators won&#39;t sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premia triggered and uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze leading out of the Great European Debt Crisis.
The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos signaled yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of hundred days established in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he was not going to support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, that of February 19.
&quot;The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit,&quot; Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message from Samaras clears doubts about his position: &quot;We have pledged to help the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything more.&quot;
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the bodies which must release the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment of realization adjustments.
But the European Commission, still angered by the impact caused by Papandreu&#39;s hiatus in the referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will only release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign not &quot;an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible&quot;.
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return &quot;very quickly&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government &quot;the elements necessary to pay the sixth installment&quot; of 8,000 million, even if it there is no definite date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: &quot;They are instruments for progress and hope&quot;
The Queen underlines the &quot;preponderant&quot; place of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain &quot;has reached a preponderant place at world level in the role of Micro-finances&quot;.
Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second largest donor on the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose &quot;essence&quot; lies in the fact that it is an &quot;instrument for progress society, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings&quot;.
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that this type of operation is &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, &quot;very especially, in that which has as its objective the reduction to half of the number of people who live with incomes below one dollar a day, to which the &quot;poverty threshold&quot; is fixed.
Spain &quot;continues to work&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with &quot;responsibility&quot;, pointed out Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, &quot;guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women&quot;, the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have &quot;achieved a lot of goals&quot; and &quot;we face a lot of challenges&quot;.
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to drive &quot;two basic goals&quot;.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families will come out of the poverty line in which they now live. .
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;has followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía underlined as an &quot;act of justice and recognition due&quot;.
And she described the father of this instrument as an &quot;admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&quot;, the work of which she knows since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know in the field. its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d&#39;Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and &quot;at each meeting I was able to observe a continuous evolution &quot;, explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifier of &quot;head of the family&quot; gathered in Valladolid from the &quot;banker of the poor&quot;.
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
&quot;Ethical Imperative&quot;
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to limit cooperation with developing countries to periods of economic prosperity, since this is a &quot;permanent obligation&quot;.
Jiménez considered that microcredits suppose &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty&quot;, and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not leave it alone or the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is &quot;one of the main lines of cooperation for development&quot;.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; of giving &quot;confidence&quot; to &quot;excluded people to whom everyone closes the door&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that &quot;opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity&quot;.
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not initially on the program but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who consider the government&#39;s policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and can -to be Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which were entitled, at the end of their speeches, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor - and of the motion - is contained in a slogan: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe but more Europe&quot;.
Not only because Europe means peace but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro&quot;.
For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe&quot;.
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage. &quot;in order to give a face to Europe&quot;.
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Admittedly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the weight of each country on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to strengthening the weight of Germany.
Anxious to appease the climate within her party, the Chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither did she seek to win her congress on the back of the &quot;small&quot; European countries or troubled countries quick to criticize arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is sick leave fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15 to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme – recurring since 2007 – of the fight against social fraud and welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in a context of rigor, but is no less heralding an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First for the purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on private sector employees a fourth day of waiting before taking charge of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days&#39; salary, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks arousing anger, but which would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic significance: imposing on civil servants a day of waiting without compensation in the event of work stoppage (they have so far no waiting period, compared to three days in the private).
While these questions are under discussion, the majority are also relaunching the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to work stoppages.
&quot;The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will reimburse&quot;, warned Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL, Sunday November 13.
As with other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, this has in fact been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have most often borne fruit.
The French no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let&#39;s focus first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances represented 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days off work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned said they had taken no sick days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was for less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to a month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28 % in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave represents very little compared to undeclared work.
As for fraud, it only reaches a low level.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term stops were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of stops of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of &quot;unsuitable or unjustified&quot; cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore 169,000 “unjustified” cases, out of several million employees who had taken sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in lost tax revenue per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to them.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to revive its economy.
This is what the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, declared before Parliament on Monday, November 14, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
&quot;To continue the efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of budgetary adjustment&quot;, declared the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
Implementing the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on October 27 will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, as the country&#39;s participation in the euro zone &quot;is at stake&quot;, he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos predicted that the country&#39;s public deficit will be reduced &quot;to around 9%&quot; of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 % in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday gave his support to measures already approved to try to end the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
“We will not vote in favor of new measures,” he said during a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He said he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and the debt, and fighting waste, but opposed any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures , Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says committee of experts
Canadians live in death denial, says Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls on governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to provide better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in death denial.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to this effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts related to various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is necessary, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.&quot;
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite most Canadians&#39; wish to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, in the country, it is in Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, that is to say the practice euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
&quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already come out in favor of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, respondents believe 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or terminating care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The committee of experts also asks that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls on governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to provide better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Me Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, described as &quot;extreme&quot; the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
&quot;This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide,&quot; said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary yesterday of the report.
Me Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values that contribute to the social fabric of society.
However, &quot;in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints&quot;.
Health law scholar Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the report&#39;s findings, calling it a &quot;pro-euthanasia manifesto&quot;.
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes in particular the data in the report regarding the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely the Netherlands and in Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a &quot;conspiracy&quot;
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a &quot;plot&quot; against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have come out in favor of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to &quot;leave power&quot; in Syria, where around 40 civilians and members of the regime&#39;s forces have still been killed.
&quot;If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase in Syrian political life,&quot; the King of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, said in a statement. a BBC interview.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu deplored that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
&quot;Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,&quot; he said, referring to neighboring Syria, towards which Turkey is taking a further line. harder.
The United States for their part welcomed a &quot;strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime&quot;, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
&quot;The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly tough tone&quot; in the face of the repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesperson for the department. of state.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces died in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians died &quot;during exchanges of fire and heavy machine gun shelling in Jobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem nevertheless estimated that the country was &quot;moving towards the end of the crisis&quot;.
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which according to him constitutes &quot;a dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;will not give in&quot;, he added, assuring that &quot;the plots hatched against Syria will fail&quot;.
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a &quot;civilian protection mechanism&quot; and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favor of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which according to him is locked in &quot;paranoia&quot;.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis resolution plan decided on November 2 and providing in particular for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the grip of the dispute and the release of the demonstrators arrested.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday deemed the Arab League&#39;s decision &quot;incorrect&quot;, while China urged Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from the markets and sacrifices from the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to train his team and implement a program, which will contain &quot;sacrifices&quot;, in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting the unions and employers today.
He is expected to set up a relatively small cabinet made up of technocrats from outside parliament.
&quot;Monti spoke of an important program with many sacrifices&quot;, said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President of the Council designate.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, for his part said he expected Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support. .
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a shortlist, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the jitters in stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In &quot;democracy, there are specific deadlines&quot; to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying he was &quot;certain that the markets will be patient and will understand&quot;.
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern took over, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The prime minister-designate is expected to put together a team comprising mostly technocrats, although he has stressed that he would like to include &quot;politicians&quot; in it.
The new government should last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr. Monti pledged, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim of Italy &quot;returning to a protagonist&quot; in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change&quot;.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called in particular for new austerity measures.
The Italian &quot;boss of bosses&quot; Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, &quot;because a country which has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters&quot;.
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a &quot;change of era&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;Berlusconism&quot;, the &quot;professor&quot; symbolizing &quot;the challenge of serious &quot; and an &quot;other Italy&quot;, according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 200 billion euros in government bonds.
A Russian scientist helped Iran&#39;s nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA expressed last week its &quot;serious concerns&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; to Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the center to establish a company producing &quot;nano-diamonds&quot; in kyiv.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to &quot;strong indications that Iran&#39;s development&quot; of a nuclear detonation system &quot;was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only was familiar with this technique, but which, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked most of its career on this technology within the military nuclear program of its country of origin&quot;.
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses increased by 50%
Crimes and misdemeanors against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence either declined slightly or increased little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence perpetrated against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase, against a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% drop in against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and misdemeanors.
The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, with 47.3% motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
&quot;After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and misdemeanors increase again&quot;, underlined the human rights organization Human rights First, &quot;the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant&quot;, added organization in a press release.
&quot;Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; added one of the organization&#39;s leaders, Paul Legendre.
“The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses,” he adds, saying this could include improving police reporting on “hate crimes”.
&quot;Hate crime&quot; in US federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now gender.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes to the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new &quot;activity&quot; tab and another &quot;name&quot; allow you to follow more clearly, live the activity of other &quot;Twittos&quot;, the Internet users whose messages (&quot;tweets&quot;) we follow and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they are forwarding messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested &quot;on a small percentage of users in August&quot; before being released to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its non-instinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to repost someone else&#39;s message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, opens thus to a wider public with a handling more comparable to that of the general public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated with sharp &quot;tweets&quot; on the interest of this innovation.
&quot;It&#39;s unnecessary, invasive, and looks too much like Facebook,&quot; @jemb123 wrote.
&quot;The Activity feature is going to help me track certain things on my Twitter feed better,&quot; @dannykronstrom tweeted.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary &quot;golden rule&quot; in the constitution
Austria&#39;s ruling Social Democrat/Christian Democrat grand coalition government decided on Tuesday to enshrine in the constitution a budgetary &quot;golden rule&quot; to reduce public deficits and thus avoid possible downgrading by rating agencies. Austria&#39;s sovereign rating (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion. maximum set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If Austria&#39;s creditworthiness were only lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year&quot;, argued the Vice-Chancellor and Democratic Minister. - Foreign Christian, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following up on a request from the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro zone on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is close to the &quot;German model&quot;, Germany having been the first European country to adopt such a &quot;rule&quot;.
By 2017, the structural public deficit must decrease each year by 0.75% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the Federal State must not exceed 0.35% each year. % of GDP, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring the public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
strong yen
Noda threatens further intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
“We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen climbed back not far from historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency which had just set a new record strength since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has since risen steadily, boosted by purchases from investors who see it as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar traded around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency harms the archipelago&#39;s exports because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of income derived from abroad by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
&quot;Japan is struggling to rebuild&quot; since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), underlined Mr. Noda who fears that this rise in the yen will kill in the bud the fragile reprise.
The world&#39;s third largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption weighed down by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister judged that the high yen did not reflect &quot;Japan&#39;s economic fundamentals&quot;.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution&#39;s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot;, suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), increasing to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling on the amounts it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the market with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, stock markets falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is still undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets are sinking a little deeper into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With renewed pressure on bond yields from troubled eurozone governments, equity markets around the world continue to give back some of their recent gains.”
&quot;Nervous investors are all too aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market participants about Europe&#39;s ability to contain the debt crisis.
&quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has its sights set on Europe and trading will continue within a narrow corridor of variation until investors see evidence that the situation has stabilized,&quot; said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone is penalizing the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is moving to its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth 1.3570 dollars, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s party, the CDU, meeting in congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing in particular for the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the EU. European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the South, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has asked the markets for time to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
New Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that implementing the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on October 27 would be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government.
Spain finds itself in the crosshairs of the markets, while legislative elections are being held in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate differential (&quot;spread&quot;) between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Awaiting Eurozone growth figures
In terms of statistics, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised the figure for the second quarter downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it is truly the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the whole of the euro zone is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must trump dogma
If there is one subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy for an electoral meeting to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place nuclear power plays in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
With 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will cause electricity demand to double by 2050 unless we deprive a huge part of the world&#39;s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight against climate change, a subject that has disappeared. of the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation plants.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few , pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, they decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their fleet by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality thwarts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a jump in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal.
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worth pondering.
European champion of wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; by virtue of which, its emissions of CO2 and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill that is 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show.
It should be remembered that our country&#39;s energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Highly exporting, it involves a galaxy of specialized SMEs on international markets and makes them very creative of jobs that cannot be relocated.
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing to a trickle the 6 billion euros of annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no such thing as a miracle power source, any more than there is a diabolical one.
The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Safety Authority which exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing power plants and the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human fault caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
The result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR has a design that makes it capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the way to seize leadership in the unavoidable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate that is so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - overcrowding of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of numbers, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of &quot;country of human rights &quot; from France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment to which foreign students are subject that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (see Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France &quot;does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters&quot;.
But it is only rarely analyzed from an economic angle.
There is a fairly broad consensus between left and right on this subject.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers&quot;, and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot; cannot accommodate all the misery in the world&quot; in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we deign to grant to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will make it possible to solve our &quot;migration problem&quot;.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay off electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) , there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration stunts growth and hurts jobs.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they risk replacing national workers, especially the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly working in jobs in sectors with job shortages.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not keep pace with the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals. .
Giovanni Peri has thus calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labor Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of €150,000 to public budgets on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the start of his term, to pick up the missing growth points &quot;with his teeth&quot;.
The teeth in question, by serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, we still have to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember it, which, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would suffice, for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon &quot;the Little&quot;, that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, while being the necessary condition of democracy, is not its sufficient condition and can even become an “instrument of oppression” as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and above all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodie of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect the double value of revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them the Republican soldiers are no longer pulling in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to need and in scattered order.
A blank check to the absolute European monarch or a jump with both feet into the void of nationalist withdrawal: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we don&#39;t want cleavers but a joint, full, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - we would not know where to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that bows to the diktats of the markets and the rating agencies, that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe which is humiliated on the international scene.
We are worried about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After having long fought this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic government.
Either.
But to think so without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;make&quot; republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be enough there.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe, genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let&#39;s make Europeans.
&quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards are becoming widespread
The world smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should indeed end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, telephone with SIM card, etc.), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most buoyant segment is that of contactless technology, which makes it possible to pay for public transport or pay for purchases by simply tapping the card against a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share should increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the supermarkets are working twice as hard.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move up a gear, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French establishments have undertaken to systematically distribute contactless-equipped bank cards to their customers in the future,” announces Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out transactions.
&quot;They&#39;ve fallen behind.&quot;
&quot;But they should finally see a real boom next year.&quot;
&quot;We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide&quot;, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Crédit Agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to market an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even affirmed that Algiers has now &quot;acquired certainty&quot;.
“The way the two organizations operate and the reports from the intelligence services show that there is cooperation,” he explained without further details.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have brought to light bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the French and Nigerien investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made directs towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
&quot;It&#39;s a step forward but we should probably wait for more formal proof before talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram&quot;.
&quot;But it is possible&quot;.
&quot;We have known for years that the sect benefits from external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active&quot;, tempers Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this &quot;support&quot; had been increasingly evident in the development and discourse of Boko Haram or in its operating methods, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or increasingly complex explosive devices and same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa &quot;Western education is a sin&quot; - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this impoverished region, the association enjoyed rapid success.
It becomes politicized and demands strict adherence to Sharia law while its activists take up the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, stepping up attacks on police stations.
Abuja&#39;s reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While AQIM has taken over Mali and Niger, while the Somalis of al-Chebab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready &quot;to share all the information&quot;.
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe him.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying thunderous declarations and shortcuts in matters of foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - fuse.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and to blame them &quot;for manipulation of their currency&quot;, a theme carrying in an exasperated America by the migration of whole sections of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if that means starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama&#39;s ex-ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly choked on an attitude that &quot;flattered&quot; the emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama&#39;s current position).
But Huntsman, who is languishing in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
&quot;If elected, I will stop Iran,&quot; he boasted.
&quot;If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.&quot;
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations vis-à-vis this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, displays an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently unaware that China has had the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine when it came to anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, thus labeling him as weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers the national security record of Obama, who eliminated bin Laden, to be rather positive.
From Iraq, she is wary of military interventions that lead to stagnation.
And, by arguing that America must be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more accurately.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic, between an orchestra and a fine buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline which directly connects, under the sea , Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte together turned the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network. .
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube linking the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed at the end of 2012, making it possible to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, ie the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will indeed make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot;, in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But this is at the cost of a weakening of energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in barely five years, to bring about the triumph of its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavy consumers of gas and whose deposits are in decline.
&quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically&quot;, confirmed François Fillon in inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent major gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in large numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-encased steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, uninterrupted over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but those responsible for the project abandoned it when the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state company permanently established off their coast.
&quot;In the event of damage, we stop the flow of gas in less than a minute,&quot; says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders who have planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the gas pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, towed by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers precise information on any deformations in the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which retains 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF joined it (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty years renewable, all of the gas transport capacity.
&quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of gas actually transported&quot;, specifies Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to recover their costs, since only Gazprom bears the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy shore lined with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, the temperature and the specificities of the incoming gas, before it is transferred into the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
It smells of adventure, of hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves in an off-white color, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (mole skin) which designates a varnished cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine has brought up to date an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century&quot;, says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to reach 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a composite portrait of the buyer, because the notebook seduces the businessman as well as the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees when it started, has almost 100 today and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has managed to impose her identity.
&quot;We followed the spirit of the times and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails&quot;, explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched a &quot;Detour&quot; exhibition where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard print cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diary, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a whole range of supports.
A success that made people envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was taken over by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities still so high?
Around 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
&quot;No, underlines Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association which organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.&quot;
“The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable.”
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher.”
&quot;However, there is still a lot to do.&quot;
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before accessing employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the bac and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, against 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria which singularly complicate the return to employment, and which &quot;constitute the crux of the problem&quot;, according to Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
There remains the unsaid, the mentalities which evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association indicated that the managers questioned have &quot;a low level of knowledge of disability&quot;, with an &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled people&quot;.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, which date from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
&quot;We are now around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of “taxed” establishments, just like the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc.&quot;
&quot;But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: &quot;So happy&quot;
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening (8:45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after his striker&#39;s gesture of humor against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
&quot;I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian&quot;.
“I want to move forward,” assures the Lille resident.
As for the contrast between his club and selection performances, &quot;it&#39;s a whole, he justified himself.&quot;
&quot;In Lille, I&#39;m there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium.&quot;
&quot;I have to take my marks.&quot;
Spared against Romania on Friday evening for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally &quot;shine&quot;.
Without however omitting the notion of &quot;pleasure&quot;.
Les Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I&#39;ve always been a supporter,&quot; he says.
Inevitably, this helps to further reinforce the &quot;special&quot; character of this meeting.
Especially since opposite, &quot;there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)&quot;, he recalls.
&quot;We ran into each other earlier.&quot;
&quot;Being able to play against them is just happiness!&quot;
Good-naturedly, Leekens for his part spoke of &quot;pride&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; to play &quot;a gala match&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; also to note - as a &quot;neighbor&quot; - that France has &quot;become a very high level team again&quot; a little over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
&quot;Laurent Blanc did a thunder job,&quot; he enthused.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would see himself sharing the plane with the Blues heading... to Brazil in 2014.
&quot;Our little Belgians are growing up,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;We are building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot;
&quot;You will realize that in the next matches.&quot; The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento&#39;s Portugal begins its comeback play-off against Bosnia (10:00 p.m.) with great optimism, this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, the two teams lacked realism.
&quot;At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country&quot;.
Paulo Bento already sees himself there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to unbolt.
In view of the first leg (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but they were unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved them.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but it does come with some risk because we didn&#39;t score an away goal.&quot;
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience which should be there as hot, even if the game obviously looks &quot;very tight&quot;, according to an optimistic but lucid Bento .
&quot;We are expecting a very tight game, but we are completely confident that we can get the upper hand,&quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012&quot;, nevertheless relativized Carlos Queiroz&#39;s successor.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, which however involves a certain risk because we didn&#39;t score an away goal&quot;, regrets Bento.
&quot;We are going to play against a team which has a lot of technical qualities and which has players with a lot of individual qualities,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the start in order not to &quot;give them time to think.&quot;
A good idea, provided you are realistic this time.
