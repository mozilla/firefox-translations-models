The remains of UKIP who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, and then discredit them with a thinly veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing nuts, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a cloth does not constitute evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence surprised a lot, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to manage to get over it.
I'm not, of course, where you're getting from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
It is talked about so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and flooding are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have fixed anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland the '' TIGER OF EUROPE'' was boasted, a few years ago.
We knew the rest!
It starts reading the article again.
It is tempted to make it appear that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, impots on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible work march, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not enough to "pave" for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80's of the twentieth century, the irlacent was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development is not a long quiet river, it is on in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes really paid by multinationals.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has returned to a huge year, and there are new (and expensive) cars all corners, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since the beginning of the school year.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will ignite soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hook on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and stripes on the old will soon be forgotten.
That said I’m flying with him next week, so I hope it won’t be on one of these two once patched up.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers extra for the additional fear that we were willing to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I've never taken Ryanair and the last 3 times I flew it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give themselves to heart.
Any of the articles about Ryanair trigger dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the base fare only have to attack themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair is not going to be happy with the extra costs of this incident.
I wonder what the delays are going to be and whether it will be necessary to compensate the passengers and, if so, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of the air traffic controllers at the airport.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a nice trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally teems with people.
People do not come en masse for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending...
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sundays, packed with people with 50% tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in tax.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right that employees enjoy, with exception.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister in charge of the economy nor, moreover, the Minister in charge of foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
As they shut it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that wish to work on Sundays.
In Montreal on Sunday a.m. I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my City of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life that he defended tenaciously against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, use to pay the inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some not terrible.
No doubt his estate would want his piece of the pie, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 He stood up to the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise the money from inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's that simple.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market by public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, infrastructure projects being by definition not very renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real French evil: the distrust of dialogue
Back to Princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
The weakest of us are not in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has the RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has returned to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on the income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate the one who invests for a return at the time of retirement and the one who lives from his annuities.
A property for rent or even two for a couple above, it is vice
The little genius of Finance singularly lacks imagination.
The new deal was a policy of major works, but at a time of lack of great infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth is emerging in response to a recession that is only a wild degrowth and therefore brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then, the need for investment is glaring: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
Taxation that promotes high incomes and rentiers.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is truly a gallop.
Samsung’s profits are being hurt by the iPhone 6 and its same-line competitors
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for Apple's benefit.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people attach no value to the design, for them the options, the functionality and the price prevail.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for “a better platform.”
Is there a "best car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving laptop industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in our best interest to all.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it wasn't an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course Parisian bobos) could they tell us which authors they fight ideas about gender and tell us the books they intend to fight.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I love you, and you're a smart and cultured person.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have his liveliness of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backlog, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean : acknowledge that , culturally , send Judith back to Holopherne , it does.
Who is afraid wonders the world?
What are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We see how much these studies affect the most intimate in them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of idea.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read ,Jean, that Le Monde has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@ : With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only presentation of their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But hey, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, that's the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon showed up briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud really enclosed the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special Blood Moon Flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey is making the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return its true color to it as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, right?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are improving greatly on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over Melbourne's suburbs.
I'll put a TAX on that eclipse.
ANYONE WHO looks at this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it eventually (necessarily) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize about the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Superb photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing on the inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so that one can make an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15 the results of miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock market collapses.
Yet they seem the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of the Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What in case of error of the Ministry of Economy?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The rest in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No The State is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the temporal horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the life of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing material and intangible investments pledged by the growth of tomorrow and therefore future revenue.
Some elements of response.
An unfortunate decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of the world’s pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical procedures, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues the politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with the drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the one in the United States, you should find out how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and “research.”
Read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as differences from country to country on what is over-the-counter or only by prescription.
This is reinforced is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that curb it and the expensive permits needed.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, Madam, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for the doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital official.
You can't HOLD patents on the grass...
If "researchers" in the social sciences did research instead of politics and networking, their "works could be used."
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy not research.
We can not say “the research is complete it must be applied” and then in the same jet “you have to experiment at all times”.
If your research is accomplished, why experiment?
If your research is not completed, why do you ask that they be applied?
Can I be explained how a “researcher” can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn to use new technologies but how would they learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
Pisa testing is just an indicator that makes an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
A single way to train teachers: to distance from training sophists and ideologues and that practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrice reread the paragraph on the stages (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: “It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system.”
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot hope that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have their place in a modern teacher training
Education theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
To give more weight to theorists of education would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally messy: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would like even less to have surgery by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP for the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR examer thanks.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I will just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = vol.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the proper license, you are depriving artists of their livelihood.
You can still debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school assignments, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson #1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property on the site under the terms and conditions they have passed by one click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 player with a friend on the school bus, they should be kicked out for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource of which we are full, the grumpy who says that everything is going wrong....
If it's a PS member who says so, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down is the speeches like yours.
@gus I have been working in a private company since always.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the null bosses that I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What do the French bosses expect to do the same ??
That the state holds their hands?
This state they accuse of imperity?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business leader verse on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who sulk and minaude while waiting for the permanent assistantship of the State!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the fall in wages if not their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But hey, Labour is going to get us out of boredom, right...
It is an international subsidiary.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from starting a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all for the decision to finally be overturned.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the contract to operate Crossrail for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they have told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
This may be because the management of the Dutch is on good track when that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a fighting girl.”
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To suppose that the fact of being "beating" is a higher quality to many others, the concern of others, the intelligence, the listening, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with that of surviving a disease: cancerous "fighting", who have no less died, I know of tiles.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we'll do it again too.
I'm not telling you that it's THE condition to manage, I'm telling you that it HELPs.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
As for the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have merit to come out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, if, having a solid morale probably makes it possible to accept heavier treatments more easily and to prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is a fighter in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "lord" it's something else.
Not with the deserved or with the courage.
These considerations are specific to the moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming a zombie.
Personally I caught two, dirt, fat, and if I "fought" myself as these fine psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only in clenching your teeth, suffering hell and taking the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers in at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told back then?
The communist turned nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what has been voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE LEAST Rule of International Law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
Westerners used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was quickly recognized by Western states that then lied from start to finish on the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not understanding the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like it).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece only a method of prediction of earthquakes works about, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is unquestionably useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules,” according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to follow therefore.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat come.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for delighting us, often, with these experimental prowess that are carried out in the world.
How would the animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
We do not have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been repeatedly observed (and for centuries) that some animals act in a strange way a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte about the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to have the validity of their work recognized on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before a seism.
So of course I am not a scientist but their assumptions had convinced me!
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this lead?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we clash with the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish turned strangely in circles.
I don't understand why we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as the mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to make a difference with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected as mayor and he didn't keep one.
It only emphasizes how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, right?
Because it is popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News for You.”
Because he's a celebrity and we've instilled in people the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and the same will be true for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be a joke
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing with him, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as president.
The French have truly and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read some books (there are, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “Strait of scrap” speak, unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the battle of Savo) do not want to return.
We have indeed passed the island of Savo, in the “Iron Bottom Sound”.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It is the little ones.

Your recit makes me rever, by identifying myself a little by the way (I also learned to sail with the Crocos of L’Elorn at the Moulin Blanc en rade de Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us reverse, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Peter, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think that the red cap that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there players in the current Serbian squad of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team
It's Bisevac the Lyon defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or before in the 70's and 80's and coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in the great team of Velez who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had sizes like Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal teammate of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *shiver*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a starter.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of pre-1913 Albania, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to the neighboring countries.
How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" when we see two towers collapse knowing that women, men and no doubt children are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the only fact that I could, even once, spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies in my eyes to a personality "border line" whose "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost circumspection.
No doubt that at the short time of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will just have thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in really and apocalyptically doing evil to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
Of grandiose.
It seems that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims consumed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We thought we were a little.
The "Christian/White/Gallow" West cannot measure the degree of frustation, anger, hatred of the musuman when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
Past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, must not push back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, the fall marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don't make your grumpy who radots clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm not developing immunity to germs from outside, that can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of surcharges for children, it is the amount collected by the State that comes mainly from the deciles 8 to 10 .
But in which concern the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to graph 2 .
The suppression of the half share concerning especially widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely under evaluation: 230M of euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not about to work out.
Well, we are not on the straw, but thinkers
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to endure much more than 75% of the tax hike, why not 90%?
Let’s continue and you will encourage these 20% to work less or to leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and OICs recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from amassing as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once the utility of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is ) to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are one of the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or else as much give up and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge head cutters have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we would not have had in a 5 star hotel and we did not have to show up at the reception or face the slightest hassle.
Just go to someone's house, sleep in it, put it behind and leave.
This will be my first option when I’m traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6am too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, that’s not true.
You just really ran out of luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
To his defense, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as if to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1 600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Supporting the troops,” sang the Bu$herie in every tone.
Therefore harmless weapons.
I am sure it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of saddam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
This is not very clear the author’s style: “in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it’s time to weaken the military to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is this always the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be strengthened a lot if we “made” them work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers currently earn more than engineers.
And let us not be made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But it does not show since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Moreover, it is so much the hideout at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we can not fill the CAPES with maths, come, we are waiting for you.
How do you not want to clog yourself with poorly educated keals whose parents spit on you by calling you a wanker?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Khurd population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first job graduated was in the sale, in London, to win three times nothing and yet it was a position for which you needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid £5 000 more a year and we did not even ask for the patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, do not worry if you do not find a qualified job, try to find something that pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed at graduate jobs, I would still be paying off my student loan
I don't like corporate work so much, so I hope to eventually spend either in the public service or in academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of the two-day streams such as art / letters / theater / media / philosophy / political science, that is to say what are called diplomas of unemployed.
I have one of those degrees and I finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above puts it, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower but we quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic sectors have been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve all the problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are two-day sectors?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you talk about degrees like media study or whatever the absconding stream you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real sectors.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture like literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better of a real territorial policy to relieve congestion in Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the end-bottom of Essonne and Val-d’Oise make 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the intra-mural and small belts already have many much more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several parks secured and locked, as there are already in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
You might as well benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well we could not find a place for A SINGLE bicycle attachment device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë.
Okay, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that stand out are: 1 / it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and do not care about the survival of the bikes 2 / we take full pollution in the head For me the bike paths are pis go, it is necessary to reduce the trafficby systematically verbalizing (even the bikes with the pres flat that must be adapted the code of the road written for cars 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the studded passages, not before otherwise cars and scooters do not get thrunned.
The bike paths are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Greater Paris?
Not a word on the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% velo moves is ridiculous.
I’m starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering begins, it would be better to find out who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it is not Russia.
Not sure how the world evolves.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases will be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents to ensure that airlines pay the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government/ultranationalists from Western Ukraine – and who want to basically demonstrate that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
The previous one: A 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for its actions.
No chance of Russia letting this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have said nothing like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a beotian in eco, it is distressing!
Called Polar is losing the north is joyful.
Only one Beotian question: is the poor man today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who most vocally criticize Piketty's book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, capital income, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital of today joins that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the two world wars that have lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is correct, one can debate it without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue one-way in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: how long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of its pavement summarized by the press wrong?
I haven't read or read it.
So I rely on the summary of his central thesis and this is the one that seems to me pure fumistry.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not been enriched overall?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember that she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old adage that the colorful perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my wishes of happiness to Malala, but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working-class neighborhoods of Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Is not Malala herself part of these “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “airtime” on this site.
You are a horrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely outrageous.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are in school and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide for herself on her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, insofar as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
Sorry she didn't put it eloquently enough for you.
This may sound contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little trouble finding her character of lookalike by Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I have to have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is above all the risks of stagings and montages that amaze me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules quite a lot the sanitization of today’s productions.
It escapes me a little to see you throw in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, for me, Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And well, I look a lot for her.
Then I think the series is sinning by writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don’t see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end up like 24 hours times what.
But everyone does whatever wants it!
It is by what I say “I will not look afterwards” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to him.
But then, that’s just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - coupons rather in the expenses of the state.
No, let's increase the expenses please.
Those who wanted to slash the expenses failed.
Triggering controversy over relatively small spending items, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the shift in direction that voters seem to be calling for and all this time some, in each side, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"Debt" is assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government taking ownership of a third of my income (even before I talk about consumption taxes) if I thought it would use it wisely.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies to almost unnecessary wind turbines and the nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residences look ridiculous.
Your first £10 000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35 000 a year will pay about £5 000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50 000 would pay around £10 000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200 000 pays around £70 000 (just over a third).
What about social security contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and that is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car thumbnail.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that this is a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But don’t pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes are going.
How can an unemployed man looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed would not look, it means that 80% are looking and do not find.
Being myself unemployed, do I have a better interest in others looking for it or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances accordingly.
Indeed I have not heard from Pôle Emploi for months, it means that agents are more busy with control operations than really getting job ads?
I do not see the interest.
Because it is not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then you have to do without Pole Employment.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks the users of a means of transport for their transport ticket, a head of department or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one screams scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I have dealt with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The file and control is currently taking over, while legally Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the border.
Non-employed politicians and French people give themselves rights that they actually do not have!
It is not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the valuation of wage labour.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality, we must have a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and population displacements at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of spirit to ban this year the Hadj in Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7 400 have had their visa application refused because of their home country or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 80's, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it to be heartless to offer to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put into strict quarantine.
Nobody's going out.
Only health workers can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're healed.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were infected after having contact with people in West Africa although they took “all the necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It spreads mainly by airlines.
Let's forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be put in immediate quarantine.
That he manages to convey the message of the first individual and the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from this conception.
It has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while religion, from the cerebellum, directs our actions from Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, it is only necessary to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiety"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you envision it pre-existed to Christ.
Hillel a century before him already said: "do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is all the Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces agapê.
Your "making justice, peace, brotherhood progress" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new game Alien, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not invented.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look.
Obviously not at work.
The joy flaps of the IT department block all the cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% discount, or do the £30 include the 20% discount?
Attention however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it sucks.
It's time to buy a new *made* video card
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I did not use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they will erase it from your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they are outside the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was 1940 France a "putrid land"?
Say, this Nobel Prize-winning one seems like a poisoned gift.
We must love it France by 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When we see who obtains the Nobel of literature one wonders if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we do not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
That would be better for judging.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate M.
Modiano has its true value, if they do not already know him!
On your side, continue to frequent Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let’s see who got the Nobel of Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi the terrible.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I don't stop seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me all the way here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible Superman III computer?
Hello Dantra, still the hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Beer and Cider Party in Nottingham.
It was messy.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving on the return on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a friend to play at the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of a beginner I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I arrive at 95 I will be as sharp as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read Buddha a little and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you are moving a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She reported the arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have our eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you reach the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but again, you make a monumental countersense: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who does not say word consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly demonstrate to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there is no doubt, I might as well say it.
Who does not say word consent, but consents to what?
Consent to a proximity to ISIS or the conviction of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, “take revenge” on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a fuck about Scotland because they have no seats on it.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" that he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death warrant of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leaders to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's more important.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected in England one day.
Splashing pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a great electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on issues that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it did well.
Yet he is still in the running to be prime minister in 2015 since he won the Labour leadership.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each player to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and up to the end.
It is “The lives of others” of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination with surveillance techniques.
Ultimately, it will have at least a sterilizing effect.

There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country appears to be run by a kindergarten class full of acid-powered schizophrenic kids.
It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot unless you win something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is actually shooting yourself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of reprisals or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is to be strongly recommended to anyone paying attention to the details rather than the c*noneries balanced by the mainstream media. The short article whose link you give is important and should be read with in mind the previous realistic observations/warnings from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who seriously fight the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world towards abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending other people’s children to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in my head.
We need a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should “we”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP which planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War in revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a lost place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a Turkish empire.
What a delusion!

I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reporting that really reflects the reality of the culture of the North of England.
No wonder that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.

The Palestinians have no partners for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, this was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative got up angry and vociferated: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not let down the guard.

Do you doubt that?!!! ...
Plus all this doesn't just revolve around Russell Brand, but Guardian reporters seem to be struggling to go beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist ballevous not written others.
This proves that you do not understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and innuendos (my 13-year-old daughter likes him, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling will be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole thing of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and instead cross their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles / videos that he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, the two parties, At no point does he say to simply ignore politics completely because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists that rather than just vote and disconnect for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, regardless of and try to influence politics from that.
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are weathervanes that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is arguing to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells the young people not to take the trouble to vote
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people were to debate what he actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The vote thing was completely distorted.
The uselessness of slipping a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years annoys me deeply since my vote really does not count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and members of Parliament who report locally to their constituents.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskyist billivations".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interviews Russell about a veranda, with even the nods added to the montage!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he is going.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the mainstream media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This “slingshot” reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the appointments of history where historians of trade have become a minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of ready-to-think condensed type Sciences Po for press kits.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on those scapegoats which are the keystone of their thought.
I believe instead that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thinking.
The problem of the relationship to the other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchistic, neo-lib and / or /libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the State, the first knowing how to seek the help of the State for its markets) in the sense of the least state / not at all of state at Foucault .
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a statement against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Nor support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of his then god, Stalin, the little father of the people.
Oulala, you have probably read a chouya too quickly if you have taken the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet puts a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty that the mechanism of accession represents in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by researchers in the humanities of the hard left who do not support that we do without allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese man for the last time.
In London and they were friendly to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990's the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think like white people!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violently anti-white remarks.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990's and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I was told, the Russians are mostly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the opinions of Australians about the Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two of them in my life (including one abroad), haven't kept bad memories of it, all people are equal and, in fact, those in London have been very nice that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we do not remember who we meet, all the people are equal, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here speak of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the said white.
How many Chinese men are with white people, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would PHYSICALLY attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, she is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left such as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: sorry, but the judicial circles are frankly a right.
As for the Judicial Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it commands to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
There is then the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The extent of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces to make a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided among these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance not being the subject of objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The previous preamble clearly allows the following to be included in the third ratio.
That of corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* that is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The field in question is that of the plundering* of heirs committed up to the means of procedural scams* by inheritance genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains good year badly year 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, some of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary is that the judicial institution has produced, during many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be thus plundered, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all the laws favorable to the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring these kinds of rational criteria then an elaborate form of lying?
Prices that are certainly totally prohibitive.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, custom-built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, could not.
As they say, the tastes and the colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks EPIC.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog poop on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the off-road tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a penchant for the longboard.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price in a bike, so “you see.”
The all-terrain tricycle seems to me particularly useful.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The trick is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know to be needed.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a draft, there are no plans to manufacture it.
I'm GLad that the "long distance" wheelchair is not coming to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive that damn thing.
Nearly 20 000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive shelling of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people who are under 18 years of age.
The eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation also, since this blockade inflicts a “collective penalty” on all civilians in Gaza.
"The entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market " ...
Ah that's not wood tongue, rather concrete and armed lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market, that is certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone with a heart and a moral sense.
The US has a well-guarded ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Do not forget also that after raising it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down by the population who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it over.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
Many are only looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and treat directly in cash, thereby bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
“That she’s renting on”?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We don't use the verb "to let" in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% in compliance with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers permission to engage in a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc. ?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it she would still be close to where you left her.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...

No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150 000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the rich is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism will not become poorer.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food therefore our food, with the structures of care therefore our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this in favor of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild bank minister to defend the interests of banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else a compent?
You call it what: turn your jacket over, put your pants down?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that neither side seemed sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if that was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea and in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really fit what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
“There was some confusion among the German ships about the fate of the two battleship cruisers, who had disappeared into the dark after stopping the shooting, and a chase began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as it approached it saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlight on the flag of the ship, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he set sail to the north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, with groping in the darkness before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have damaged them severely, so in the confusion they leaked to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several voices are raised by the UMP to request that it be enshrined in the law that an elected official definitively convicted is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected officials of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEE I PROPOSE A REGISTRATION ON THE WALL OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to coax those who will take advantage of their non-removability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who really try to make things happen, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small signs" of the sous pour la justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if trade unions on the right, even the far right, designated personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your affirmations are completely free.
If, currently the right pays the judicial news it is simply that it has committed acts that fall under it!
We do not have an example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not had preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the judicial union, which is on the left, is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it is no secret.
It is now questionable whether the "mission" of some judges is not smearing any more than instructing.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not civil servants like any other: they are the only ones to have the power to indict and incarcerate the whole-one-everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most hunky idiot of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is among the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all of them have made the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else have participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 70’s and 80’s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television’s light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But this is what happens to most stars who do not participate in the contests.
Few, after a tube, manage to make others.
Either way, most singers/bands can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
Can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar showers who smoke weed in their father’s garage and throw three chords on a poem elementary school level will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the people studied – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and kneaded with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations on a daily basis.
Except you're recklessly interpreting in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than say that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Mariannes and Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as a reminder to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It is deco ephemere to furnish the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of the sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the nettles not scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative critique of disciplines to laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
We are there in full (and old) controversy over the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book “The Shamans of Prehistory”, particularly the augmented re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Heterosexual men like anal sex?
To you, Mike, I could get into it.
So it's over between us?
I really don't understand why can't we continue to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn’t watch a musical on this, though, that would be too gay!
You could expect to have that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than sneer with these childish ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away then.
If these "childish ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, right?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Video amateur of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have taken out the safety car at the time or another vehicle (trigger for example) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not see fit to advance the time of departure (TV right, pub, money ...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share this view.
But it also happens that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restart a chance to beat the English who was leading then...
You are letting go on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it’s okay, I have a little time to flush out all your c*****ries.
No, just no.
There have been a lot of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts dead-ending commissioners for a distant story of the possibility of victory for one pilot at the expense of another.
It is not the FOM that takes out the safety because it is the FIA.
Size shade.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA above all to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner waves a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the complete video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the agitated stewards a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are more under the yellow flag.
Some comments show a grim ignorance of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag after the scene of the accident, hence the roden green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The police station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget about sex, the fear of not having sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that you really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people to be able to keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch the fear” It should be “derailed,” not “cough.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing.”
I wonder if all the people who are panicking that Ebola could start to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules beautifully and solidly this pseudo-journalism abject.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) for the government can make us slip away when it needs it.
I believe that it is perfectly logical that, if we are to be subject to a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven cases?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Is there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing through fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be of this world almost 35 years later.
Moreover at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the years 1980-90.
I’m a bluff, living with the certainty of spending there for years.
Testimonial completely useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as a scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@traffic: Testimonials cannot be used as a scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it’s bullshit, it’s an unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of the new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
What do you base the research on, then?
About fantasies?
Do you put at the same level fanciful theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Resilience”: the word hood worshiped by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D’ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords in the shrinks.
Cyrulnik gave us the “resilience” blow.
As he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he has tinkered with us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think about Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to bring out the Sentinels from the air...
And why then?
It was a great series and it looks like the people who bring it out are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang on?
The only solution that comes to mind is the humour like pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging.
Ah, because it's a children's series?
UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if we don't see the wires and the animation is done well. :-)
I can’t wait to see this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition the half-hour episodes now go to 05 h 30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have made it impossible to find anything.
The Temple Mount if it exists it is elsewhere.
Could be in Argentina??
This mountain is not sought after for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For the Muslims, Muhammad went up to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac there.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how much the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God recognize his own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To boast of tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naiads half-disbed, long-disturbed on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary though.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
Too bad the Reuters photographer did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone the Jewish faithful below, praying at the Western Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever-increasing remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of moaning and moaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not bored with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it held up.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage that this deal will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we begin to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This is a huge impact, when digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the XVIII there were unions in all regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave it (well, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and close its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, the globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the sindicat of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll be a union.
You're warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of category interests, the protected professions with trade unions are already quite well subject to the protection of trade unions, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us remove "through his delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
He will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely essential with the irruption of informational power.
And yet you opened, presumably read and commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off Review.” ?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been watching, and I can tell you that some have been seasoned well.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (albeit misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the mmmh pie...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has done like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master"!
Perhaps the extra pressure of friends and relatives outside finally had an effect for them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept out.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears the last week.
I like to cook but I can't imagine inflicting this on myself.
I am grateful to those who do and thus offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to decide, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the base a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green icing on Richard's mill did not make you want, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allotted.
There is also the cancer that awaits, with the solar winds.
Definitely, everything is happening to us right now.
A bad time to pass for humanity, hopefully.
You confuse the solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to “hunt” ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers.”
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets UVA and most UVBs pass.
You know you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a person when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to be pedagogical.
Without saying that I am a regular of melanoma, UV only ACCELERATE its development.
They don't PROVOKE it.
As proof: not all tanned people necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a toubib tells you that you should avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we take it to the blender?
or pass it in the blender...
I believe that the majority of those interested have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as frontline communication hardware.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it
Except a Nokia 3310.
More precisely, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone was removed from the main production line and we can't see how it could come back.
Therefore, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put all-test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
Oh the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in » industrials' We put forward super u but all the brands and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650 € (medium salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put their priorities where they want to.
For me, food is one.
Go without grudges, I kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecologists, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
This is total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining in this the left-caviar, from which they are sometimes from, for example by condemning the rejections of CO2 while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuferie also do not be surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I would like to be part of it, but I don’t find myself there.
The concept is not that complicated.
Boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the ecologists at all.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to face this giraffe.
She's so badly done that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic breeds of dogs that smoke while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is more than just representing the real.
If you’re just looking for this, a camera will do.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still enough to save money: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty forces us to say that France is downsizing, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
@edmond: that's what I said, look elsewhere where to save but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
That all those who have met little or no military thing dare come to say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
That the same potion is applied to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why Defence can consider itself a little busy!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees to say that they have to be made, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan to murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It would have to be done but especially that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself at each post closure, maternity hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not welcome the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most mind-boggling thing I’ve ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who commented make the same bad joke.
It’s the depression of scrolling through his Facebook feed and seeing that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone falls by chance on his ex on the bus on his way to work and realizes only there that his skirt has entered his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally stupid.
Not really, in my opinion the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and to grind his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the "internet."
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just really demonstrated that he is at the top of the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm falling backwards!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible dazzling and the unsurpassable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker as a divine glow.
God, that was really bad.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
We decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away....
Translate : Aeolians and solar farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the con-tributable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit oneself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is reduced drastically.
Electricity by renewables to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity through wind or PV renewables is already more GHGs on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with wind or PV renewables would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 moreover I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I have said.
For what I have not said it is you who lend me ideas I have said nothing about Germany nothing in fact you have not responded to what I said and like all the people of the right to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote from experts appointed by the German Government: Germany’s current programme of renewable energy is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be discontinued.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium mining and construction and if you do not count the water gas vapor of less effect than Co2 it is true to recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water vapor and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you mentioned Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It doesn't surprise me, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant in South Asia.
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Aklkata's Athletico winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The race for the low-cost pitcher pays for cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is only manifested with a helium that is too cold.
We may therefore not be in a defect in design, but of implementation...
Unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurer.
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate because many media resume the only titles of articles - and that many readers retain only these titles.
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is only a thrower problem.
