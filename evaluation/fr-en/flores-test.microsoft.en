This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details that fossils typically can't provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown brown on top and pale or carotenoid in color on the underside.
This discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called the rachis, but nevertheless show other feather-specific characteristics – beards and barbules – the researchers deduced that the rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists point out that it is indeed the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young.

The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in some kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers verify his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, said those accused had their faces concealed when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, none were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The lane where the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow rescue services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have found the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos and so on. of suspects."
The Crown Attorney's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., trained volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first cull campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday inducted a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to set the country on track for new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPods overheating were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman. »
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as I was... or even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she rests in a better place. »
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as it was prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more specifically how Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "gossip and political nonsense."
He is believed to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not the ground-based radar systems previously used, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation created the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to take much longer, following breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled in tiny pieces
It can be pulled into fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, moist hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushed toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women rubbed shoulders.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call into space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transport much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, car and many other means of transport.
Underneath are medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the smaller, much more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lion cubs.
Women are usually very close to each other, their family being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Troops of lions act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the ample roar of the lion, but rather a sentence whose words would be screams and rumbles.
Ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots stalk and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their path on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots track their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had his tongue forked. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no match for him.
Although the Romans consumed food that we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails as well as loir, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on their sides while they had their meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered the abode of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; The shops were just open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests made of Canaan earth, wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it that — while traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence read the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of the France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free France forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," which means large city or city-state and also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or interstate tariff laws.
Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the fifteenth century, while European navigators passing by referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings bordering the complex have been rebuilt in order to offer tourists a better glimpse of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35mm; It was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It's still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of the photographic sensor of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and this is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (APS format family, for example) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, badly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that creates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic elicited only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless submarine warfare.
During the 20s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wished to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest eras in the history of Chinese antiquity. Thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it is not easy at all to find, even if we know that it exists. When you enter the cave, you are completely isolated.
Above, one can contemplate nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives as well as his family members.
The "push" symbol looks like a V and the "pull" symbol looks like a staple or square with the bottom side missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while a bow towards the bottom is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own marks in pencil, but remember that printed bow marks are printed for a musical reason, and therefore must generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were obliged, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banks.
Naturally, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe running from the eleventh to the thirteenth century (1000-1300).
The Central Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that humanity's destiny is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology affects societies that are intrinsically conditioned rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
According to Romanticism theories, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the tenth and eleventh centuries and the fourteenth century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow means of communication, Western fashions could lag by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system using conserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); In some cases, the child's abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability from which the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; Some would have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, the support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way to help learners who are discovering a new teaching such as using a new curriculum or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little Microsoft Office trombone man is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student alone to manage.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered to be major factors in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities for interpreting human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two basins in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to respond has serious consequences: impaired growth, malnutrition and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" much the same way savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and drowsiness shortly thereafter (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent alarm clock, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed across the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person's degree of inner peace is opposed to the degree of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana Love Path and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras activated, and awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures put an end to the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through proxy armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties.  whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign during the Second World War. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known term shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
The "wagonways" were built in England as early as the sixteenth century.
Although the carriage tracks were simply made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Braces were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("upright man").
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even advocate for the alleviation of future suffering.
In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humanity.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs since they have wings and can fly.
But there's a lot about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Probably the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very adapted to parasitize humans.
Reduced bugs, like bed bugs, are nidicolous, that is, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their best interest, or that of the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue one cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to label either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
For example, you can go see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small country towns to work and come across other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a passenger car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its steady state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or, is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and passenger vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; Thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically approximately.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) throughput, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly away. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape enemies and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and mayflies.
A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
Sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
As much as 20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that the latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new ways of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and rarer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like making a heavy cart climb a hill. By dividing the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people feel good or are attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to stay "the good buddy" (or the right girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she has to change everything the group has created so far and do things their way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to dissension between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose on itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore make it possible to reduce the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injury, tumor and trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is the automation by machines of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual field trips. Students can look at ancient artifacts from a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a stunning piece of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try the blog experiment with unkempt grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to engage the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When properly used, blogs "can allow students to strengthen their analytical and critical thinking skills: by actively reacting to online content, they can confront their opinion with that of others and present their own points of view on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You will find Niagara Falls to the south and the Muskoka region and surrounding areas to the north, which have pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider the epitome of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent of its own, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too precious.
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they see as harassment. It is indeed common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing advances to men, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, one can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and trinkets of all kinds, but that's it for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma needs to be researched to understand the state of fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking treks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has a style more Arab than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km², it is divided into 14 ecozones, each home to a specific fauna.
It is one of the most famous amusement parks in South Africa and considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card that gives access to some parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draws Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon waterfront located opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the northern shore embankments.
This is the place that the British settlers invested. So, this seems like a good place to start, if you're looking for evidence of this region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often fully booked, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; It is 378 meters long and has two tracks 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the sixteenth century, Paraguay, once nicknamed "the giant province of the Indies", was born from the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish ushered in the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
The British pound is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the nearby islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics and summer temperatures exceeding 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it look colder than the thermometer says.
There aren't really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: rainfall is pretty much constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, they are nonetheless wildlife; Please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, moose, bear and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Tupua paramount leader Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland straddles two ports. The most popular are found in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe to swim, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are on Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary, but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are plenty of French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "café crème" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay special attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, box jellyfish arrived near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would stray from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing they will have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or get you other documents needed for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any modification or request must however be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to get up close and personal with the music event, you're going to have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Keep in mind that even if musical performances are over on the main stages, other musical performances may continue until late at night at other festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
St. Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are rarely found, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment in order to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone driving to high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like you're on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In everyday language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion on African land, and in particular in the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment allows them to be well observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them best with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walking", "walking safari" or "jogging") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be faced with a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies don't extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, they can be dried more easily. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be loaned, even if there aren't any in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid not allowing the fabric to overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, it must be done for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with in their home area.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some communities, duty-free shops present an opportunity to purchase goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections – usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
In contrast, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are baked and baked all year round, while cherries and plums point the tip of their noses in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often pair particularly well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid," depending on how much sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands in Indonesia, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without further qualifiers, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers an array of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese favor being peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: indeed, the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and quite narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider who falls.
Cochamó Valley – The excellent climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different granite walls and cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas of the mountains are impregnable. Mountaineers all over the world are constantly discovering new paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snowy slope with skis or snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", who organize their entire vacation around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to 5,000 BC. !
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the seventeenth century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski touring: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring.
This is similar to alpine-type ski touring, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rough terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than on foot – but you will very rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In typical circumstances, traveling through several countries therefore involves having to make several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat as one country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the area, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax agencies define property over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood among the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Even though, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term "gypsy" is often considered pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are travelling to is subject to a travel advisory issued by your government, your overseas health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather event that has the potential to cause damage, severe social upheaval or loss of life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of many kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
High winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Extreme weather events, both regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snowstorms with high winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of inclement weather that may affect their destination region, as this may affect the routes they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues covered here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to have scans while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a rockfall or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a fast current to deep water can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion that results from attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, the return to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again.  It is also possible that depending on your skills and whether or not you have been spotted, you may want to wait for help.
Reintegration shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your home culture.
In the beginning, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountain Range crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which rises to 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cell phone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and telephony needs.
Your local phone provider should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those planning a gap year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having taken gap year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
Generally, registration fees are required to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a top destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but other than that, this is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the seaside at all and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
Don't be ashamed of it: it's no different from the personal fears and fears that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well compensated for making fast deliveries. Often, in the context of an urgent repair, the question of deadlines is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts related to it.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on some routes it would have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Aviation regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better yet, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in seeking discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that they have a certain type of traveller who is willing to pay a high price for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares with full knowledge of the facts.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent hub for connections.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and lively commercial center, set around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glazed buildings, and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled, eighteenth-century market roofs, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and is home to an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures depicting doves on some graves.
It is worth walking for half an hour in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located to the north, is easily accessible and has been made famous among foreigners by Lord Byron's vivid account of its splendour.
Bus 403 from Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
Heading north, be sure to visit the beautiful Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a world-famous place for the apparitions of Mary.
Remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many living women and men who survived their time here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as the law establishes that it is the first official language.
Yet Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are only made in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often inaccurate, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave at your best, to act like someone well-mannered. This will make your travels much easier.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians evaporate quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly beech, spruce and fir, and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and elevation levels.
The region is also home to a very wide variety of animal species and birds.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and capercaillie can be spotted here, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders equally covered.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive with nothing, but if you bring your own, and in addition it has bright colors, you will be entitled to a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just as men must wear trousers covering the knees.
This garment can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie which means you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a great way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the next vowel.
Please also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" in a distinct way: "caro" means "expensive", while "carro" means "trolley".
Persian has a relatively easy grammar and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish might hastily conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their time was not as concerning as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures placed in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "one" from them.
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the collection of "specimens" will also have you expelled without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you get there.
But, located in the "high tropics" only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and a strong radiation of the sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also a few buses that fly north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or boating along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for hiking trails and popular cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christendom, it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions related to these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is traditional to spend Easter night awake in an open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the feast at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that arrived on these islands did so originally by water, by swimming or aboard floating objects, or by air.
Due to the great distance separating them from the mainland, the mammals could not complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark most of the day.
As the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japan's work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners may be accustomed.
The costumes are classic work clothes, and employees are called by their last name or by their function.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the agreement of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
