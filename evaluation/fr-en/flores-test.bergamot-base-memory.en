The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement by the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization rather than revocation of accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s survivors may have gone unnoticed for so long and is taking any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on the top and pale in color or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also helps to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called spine, but nevertheless show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and barbles – the researchers deduced that the spine was probably a further evolutionary development to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
The scientists say it is certainly the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young person.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

“Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of the planet’s large caves that maintain a constant temperature, but they look similar in that they are deep holes in the earth,” said Glen Cushing, a crew member at the USGS (American Center for Geological Surveys) and staff at the University of North Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally an experiment of low technicality: voters are isolated in a cabin, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the urn and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations in a fairly strict way.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can find that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the group of women sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, i.e. 2:11.60 minutes less than Austria's Claudia Loesch, first arrival, and 1:09.02 minutes less than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who arrived ninth.
In the women’s category in sitting skiing, four skiers failed to complete their course; as for the giant slalom, 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in this race failed to rank. 
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop.”
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared in court. 
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured. 
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow the rescue services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT. 
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody while awaiting her indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait has been widely disseminated. 
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that “journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they post photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecutor’s Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments will be made until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will focus on the dispute at the border that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority consents only for a period of five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Park Conservation and Heritage Manager at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were duly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday inducted a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members. 
This is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were sparked by the absence of elections, some of which were to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of defective iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had knowledge of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called “non-severe.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s adjournment of the report “really regrettable.”
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country. 
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said there were no signs of a tsunami. 
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by turning their buses to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot with his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births during his free time. 
Her research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the baby’s lung maturation.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election found that the number of opponents of transforming Australia into the Republic had increased by 8% since 2008. 
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's rule.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He could not take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, which is forbidden within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form protein and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, and more specifically how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors “chatter and political nonsense.”
He is believed to be running for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow devices to fly over shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on previously used ground radar systems, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
The additional transport is non-existent and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking lots and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport has created the possibility that the match can be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Equatorian Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have indicated that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although this process has been estimated to be much longer, following the reproduction between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant pinson, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled in fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be done very thin, and stuck on another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called “luminished manuscripts.”
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since the hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell. 
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every home connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, in Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women rubbed shoulders.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly. 
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has given us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat small, much more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task devolved to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lion cubs.
Women are usually very close to each other, with their families made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes hard), swim, jump from great distances and tow with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the lion’s ample roar, but rather a phrase whose words would be screams and rumblings.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, the ocelots track down and find the animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their way to the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. Ocelots track their prey by blending into their environment before throwing themselves at them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations. 
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species. 
We call this process “speciation,” which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We manufacture our homes and herbal clothing. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the superpredator of the time, it feared nothing except the other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palate, so everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had his tongue forked. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibalistic.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was not in size against him.
Although the Romans consumed food that we know, they ate some strange or unusual party dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails as well as the loir, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they were eating their meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later. 
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was going outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stone. 
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it that — traveling further west.
But regardless of his discovery, Equimal tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence. 
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words “Orinative Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776” could be read. The text is at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three-quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled. 
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of facing it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated the south of France and were heading towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The term “civilization” is derived from the Latin word “civilis”, which means civil and is related to the Latin words “civis”, which means citizen, and “civitas”, which means big city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates. 
The cities-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — the Congress being its only component — under the articles of the Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or from tariffs between states. 
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7 000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often geographically referred to as an "archipelago".
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European sailors passing by mentioned it under the name of Ilha Formosa, or “beautiful island”.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt in order to offer tourists a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues until today.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is the 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of the photographic sensor of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (by dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest of integer ratios) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format family) are equal to or approach this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, highly mistreated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that drives dynamism while providing protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's money market funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain was out of international waters in order to prevent ships from venturing into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic only provoked a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its boundless underwater war.
During the 20’s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the most bloodthirsty eras in the history of Chinese antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true for the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on the class, but on the calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes from other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name of "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy at all to find, even if we know it exists, and when we've entered the cave, we're completely isolated. 
Above, one can contemplate nothing other than the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can only see or hear very little from this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The plateau of Giza, or “Giza necropolis”, in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, gathers several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The “push” symbol resembles a V and the symbol “pull” to a staple or square whose lower side is missing.
The top means that you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means that you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to write your own pencil marks, but do not forget that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and that it is therefore generally necessary to respect them.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were obliged, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war spending of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that pushed the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Central Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Early Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological thrust or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: the technological development itself unfolds according to a process that goes far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that are conditioned intrinsically rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The massive possession of cars also leads to a greater impact of accidents on the road, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily harm.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to the laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted up to about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders were responsible for presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th–11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could lag behind 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothes.
Subsistence farming is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds originating from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same-sense ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
The members of a subculture often report their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered “ferocious” or wild. Some wild children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When fully elevated by non-human species, wild children display behaviors (within their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but more a way to help learners who are discovering new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is one of them too.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to query, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult for the student to manage alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach of uses and gratuities.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al. 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” have also been identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate variations between the two basins with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of reaction has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a little the same way that the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and drowsing shortly after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to come out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person’s degree of inner peace is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the profound conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures put an end to the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and belongings, while interfering with your enemy’s ability to move their people and property.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goatmen who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term of shepherds. These pastoral methods are still ongoing today.
The wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The crossroads were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on the top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus (“right man”).
Their predecessors, the australopithecs, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations can be found in the Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign in order to alleviate the suffering to come.
In many cases, it is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to the scientific and technological progress made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of humanity.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten project signed by Congresswoman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few streets away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as “Dunlap Broadsides”.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who made him read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs have survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs to be a result that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and provided with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic household drugs or chemicals.
Consult the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term “insect” is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are very suitable insects to parasitize humans.
The redusts, like bed bugs, are nestling, that is to say adapted to live in the nest or the habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the education of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method makes it most of the scientific research.
However, this is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to operate for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the phage’s DNA with radioactive phosphorus, or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, we can go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in the car to get to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a passenger car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere of its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and passenger vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) throughput, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape their enemies and find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarchan claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water from the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6 387 km (3 980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then much over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. It was the earth, the water, the air and the fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also emitted the theory that the latter are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to rarer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's like climbing a hill to a heavy cart. By dividing the core again, and then releasing a little of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under the continents.
There may be more Maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what in their environment drives them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg’s two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being to try to stay "the good friend" (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, conduct disciplinary actions, carry out evaluations, entrust responsibilities, and hold others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things in his or her own way.
After all, the chef is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to dissent between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to establish itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative new process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization is innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore make it possible to reduce the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, damage, tumors and brain trauma affect the behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and hardware to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly connoted science fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is to be automated by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, ability to answer customer diagnostics and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been put in place in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at the ancient artifacts of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design an annual website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often attempt the blog experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog is beginning to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “forces students to get to know the world around them better.” The need to generate public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that drives collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used well, blogs "" can allow students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinion to that of others and expose their own points of view on very specific topics"" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
You will find further south the Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings which have a pristine natural beauty.
All of these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the epitome of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent alone, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam into the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels to say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider harassment. It is indeed common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in the refusal of men's advances, and do not be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, it does not mean that it is acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and knickknacks of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city’s streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma must be researched to understand the state of fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla tracking treks among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Timbuktu” has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites, due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on the PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, it is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the best-known amusement parks in South Africa and considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It can be beneficial to get a Wild Card that provides access to some parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draw the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar graph, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire Hong Kong’s most beautiful panoramas, leave the island and reach the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the land of the north shore.
This is the place that British settlers have invested. So, this seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the world’s largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not, however, composed only of mangrove marshes: they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered with water/swamp zones.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other side) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30am and 7:30am.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Group taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nude).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a cable-stayed bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as the “giant province of India”, was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the book of the Falkland Islands (FKP) whose value is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The pound is a commonly accepted currency all over the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards are likely not to be accepted, although British and U.S. currencies may be. Talk to owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Montevideo being located in the south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are not really “rainy” and “dry” seasons: rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you have to stand at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the buffalo, the momentum, the moose, the bear and almost all the great animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40 000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated at a peaceful rally in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by phutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the “Number One”, a fairly ordinary, but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the “Manta”.
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have fears about it.
For Australians, the idea of a “cream coffee” is foreign. A short black is an “espresso”, the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate complies with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs and pay particular attention to the safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would depart from it.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat is found in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transport service to/from the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or get other necessary documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on the spot, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Remember that even though the musical performances are over on the main stages, other musical performances can continue until late at night at other festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed huts.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the locals who offer free alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters the judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to remain sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On the icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can not drive as if you were on the naked asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in a very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or blowing snow or blowing snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most significant moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, and in particular to the savannah, with the aim of witnessing the striking spectacle of wild animals in their environment. 
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and the standard equipment allows them to be well observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with twins.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, "foot safari" or "jogging") involves hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2 500 and 130 000 yen, with typical tickets costing about 7 000 yen.
By ironing the damp clothes, it is easier to dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that can be loaned, even if there is none in the rooms. 
If you do not have an iron or do not feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try to use a hair dryer, if you find one.
Avoid not allowing the fabric to overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is enough to boil the water for one minute; in others, it must be done for several minutes. 
The effectiveness of the filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they do not know in their home region.
Pests can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.

Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.   
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through remote backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even greater than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and cooked in pastry all year round, while cherries and plums point to the tip of their nose in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go especially well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid", depending on the amount of sauce it contains.

Indonesia has 17 000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of dishes simply seasoned, the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: indeed, the user's feet can get stuck there. 
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot taken in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of security measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Then, some stools, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large different granite walls and cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the panoramas of the mountains are impregnable. Mountaineers from all over the world continue to discover new paths passable on the slopes, where the possibilities are limitless. 
Downhill winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding to hit a snowy slope with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called “ski bums”, which organize their entire holidays according to skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to some 5 000 years BC. J.-C.!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians. 
Ski touring: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or ski touring. 
This is similar to alpine-type ski touring, as well as mountaineering, but not to incorporate these activities in general, which are practiced on rough terrain and require the use of skis and boots that are much more rigid. 
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel distances a little larger than on foot – but you will very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomy slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under traditional circumstances, traveling through several countries therefore implies having to make several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates a bit like a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the borders without passing through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax organizations define property of more than 100 years as antiquities.
The criteria vary depending on where you are; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe. 
Handicrafts can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer farming is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi and the cultivation that surrounds this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they were living on fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.

Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search of "Hostile Environment Courses" will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with hands-on experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training in the handling of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return trip in their possession. 
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose gender is not indicated (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.

Transsexuals in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The currents of tearing are the currents that return from the waves that break on the beach, often on a pitfall or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current to deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible. 
As soon as you get out of the current, getting back to swimming is no more difficult than usual.

People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers and travelers returning home.
The sound and light show to the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions of the region for children. 
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually, you can always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: the island of Livingston and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula blend into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain Range and crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which rises to 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular phone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony. 
A satellite phone usually does not replace a mobile phone, because you have to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as shipments that have the need for remote data transmission and telephone. 
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility. 
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, because it allows them to take a year of leave before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, having completed sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
As a general rule, you must pay a registration fee to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for boating. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You do not necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes. 
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but other than that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most cruises on the Baltic are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by checking the map above, Berlin is not located near the seaside at all and no tour of this city is included in the price of the cruise. 
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
You should not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or about not having control.
Transport companies are well paid to make fast deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repair, the issue of time limits is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts related to them.
On some roads, big companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses there has been a problem.
If they had sent goods by air cargo, on some routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to it faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that is where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better still, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, it is useless to seek discounts for seats in business class or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are very well aware that they can count on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they establish their rates knowingly. 
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very widespread.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone is able to speak Spanish.
