Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, refused the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs refused at second reading the proposed amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for reaching a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the regime's judgment as political revenge and has provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court also in the west.
The plan to annul paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its vanquished.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are the Islamists, but are they the moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has declared the usual law of Sharia law and we already know what it is about.
Libya is becoming a country without crime because for a theft we cut off the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the non-respectful possible of the faith are punishable by the death penalty...
It is the Quran that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order reigns as we cannot represent it and as we would surely not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial to the Libyans.
It is especially surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted the help with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who directed the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with every attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our policies turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold?
Perhaps not so much and the West can finally boast of protection from human rights.
As long as we are prevented from doing so by these followers of Sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published the information on GDP for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistics offices in the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published their visions of economic development earlier for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has a projected growth of 0.5%, that of France of 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany placed better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated for the last quarter.
The German economy in the third quarter grew by 0.5% according to the data forecast and recalculated periodically.
The eurozone and European Union economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on ten-year bonds is 28.45%
The bond yields of Spain and Italy are rising towards critical limits.
Problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and the goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has defended hard with also a good share of luck in the second part its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a big share of luck for the second.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification in the European championship.
The Montenegrains found themselves under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football caisse.
From the first minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams were struggling to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the center line.
Pressure from national footballers failed to break through the Czech defense, which responded precisely to long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred graduate students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has noted in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Israel reports of a possible attack by Iran's nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the case of an attack, the objective of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would not only be Isfahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The feeding of an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems overweight, 9% of schoolchildren will weigh above the average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important is the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, for example, 50% cold cuts is found more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the big little ones the sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and participated in 900 pupils from the primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, even obese, children is the absence, of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - snack- dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and cold cuts at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families each has breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been raised is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diets from opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is a great preference for sweet lemonades," the survey results said.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starchy food at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading to Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a check of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet was attended," the results of the survey said.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as their main course and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour or potato dumplings).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams and the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "bulstered".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) treated with the way to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without any particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically ammenuize wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus managed to emphasize beautifully the character and also not to dress too sighted types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth getting custom made.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides permanently, rolls up and does not fit the belt and so on.
For those with a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that given what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of personality mode as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, which maybe you know from the Victoria Secret campaign.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred pounds lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from the magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphic design.
The Moodboard, as we say for the end result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic design.
Also reflecting on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress the physical but creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, has kept us going through all this.
But this, until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single dress in a different way.
For this important example, variability is.
Like for example this trench coat that must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a picture like a dress.
Or you just have to go up the sleeves or the collar and have an immediate new look.
“Play with that,” he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the job you need to know the rules perfectly".
“You can then start to contravene it,” Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, towards what, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story which will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I must be ready to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to count on that during a model creation.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services is still cautious.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (just know something but what I look like goes second).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to rely on the fact that they dictate to us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than the size they actually have.
We then have only to browse on google and ensure if the information of boulevard reports the celebrity in question, if it has lost or enlarged etc...
Honza and Mario put us on the heart on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not flattering themselves, keeping your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort her closet and fill her with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell her, God what a horror."
“You’ll find some things you’ll find pretty and him that you’ll advise with what to wear them,” Mario says.
He has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, rolls for distillation or even nursery pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple are not useable because they could be used)
So that we were not only people who listened but tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resow shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
And so we stuck and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently hurt ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I report is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I’m starting to figure out more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fought across America.
Revision
Originally a trouble-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who don't care about it on a routine morning commute to work.
This fulfills everyone’s ambition to a certain extent, but it’s useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and release some kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how will be the added passages during which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole is pulling down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to settle them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get first to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
This results in each race taking place on another route and the stages planned in different environments that stand out quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also quite pretty even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Finally, it is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition from time to time embellished with an atypical element.
For example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to this the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to surpass the number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the timer) and then still awaits you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and who try to make the situation hard.
The novelty is the off-car crossings.
It’s more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help them by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What’s surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
To the result it is good as this because this element is not likely to hinder and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that there is nothing extraordinary right now, but we cannot say that it is negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is okay.
The problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet at the point.
We do not expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, so it is not completely good.
During the tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes off in crazy aerobatics.
Or else is in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken your face or you have come out in the set the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go the way it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and it is necessary to find the solution by remembering from memory the piece of route in question.
The great catch of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that must be passed in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you encounter on a given place civil vehicles always in the same configuration that you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds early or one minute late.
What makes things angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, you either have to put yourself aside and conturn them or brake.
It's equal if you go to the front of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation he always arrives very close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you still have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good number of times.
It is understandable that the purpose of this game is to do something exciting and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you are getting bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American displacements for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic attire on very technical driving for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know from the adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of conductor, different objects start to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog feature which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and gives you other functions in the community.
One of the hardest shots to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the darkness on the lanes (it looks like).
Your speedometer shows you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you arrives a subway train that sends you the car directly to scrap metal.
At the editor we had a discussion for a few days to know if someone really thought about when creating this game or if the authors really think we are fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What bothers is that in more extreme situations, imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is mostly about accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is of your choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest audience a new sound track was created in the style "I mix everything", but we can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the faults to hit you in the eyes with the strength of an airfield reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a hard war.”
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role," said Miléna Vicenova, who began her presentation at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from Charles University’s Faculty of Law could envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto “comprehensible and openly about Europe” very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, critics sounded the criticism that he is bland, that he is a leather circle, that he can not fill any mission and I must say that he has taken everyone's breath away because he holds his role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in an answer to the question: "Who is in the European Union?" "To what phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards uniqueness and greater readability of the Union's policy in the face of states, as is China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in a near time.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has beat its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself even now.
In addition, the new seven-semimal budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated, must also be approved because of the current economic situation.
Since it would seem that the budget will be slim and for savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As must the citizen understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas differing large or that no one has forbidden us to make syreckys.
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, according to her, results from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and a weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successor Czech Presidency, it then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak, this Frenchman come to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what else is this group of Visegrad doing?" and he's not at all happy.
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future it is new and tough rules on fiscal policy that await the member countries.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at several speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
In the first place it was said that the countries that want them and those who do not want to cooperate among themselves remain in their corner.
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a truly two-tier Europe," said Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis that all topics impacting the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not just the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The IBM Innovator Begins the Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "the long term."
For a large audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that many global issues can be solved if people are eager to think.
His slogan "PENSE'!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began editing in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the care company developed by Watson.
For us IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements directed to the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years because it has always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more," said the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have the holidays paid, insurance paid by the employer plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-crafted system of rewards for inventors and business.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at first brilliant in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has made so-called jamy, online brain-storming from which many future strategies and innovations come from.
It is no wonder that he has many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a safe position in the business field.
“From the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at Harvard’s School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world using its technology,” added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is colloquially called in the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technological firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of products from the server to nanotechnology.
She has numerous patents from all American technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries is for example the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technology firm according to the market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Overview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed in the bet on a clean operational system OS/2, the online Prodigy service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead of time you can't emotionally stand on the past," remarked Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem to build its foundations on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competition that at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, still in 1990 it was with more than the most powerful hardware representative of participation.
Starting in the year 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for US$15 billion, during that period it invested US$58 billion in the purchase of outlook technologies.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased his investment volume.
Now it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM share has grown from 2008 in rocket by 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
This can be expected that this flexible giant will master other crises.
IBM Story: From the slices of cheese to the thefts in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80's of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the former "pointers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the supervisory board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the firm's founder - it is on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of society have been based until now.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machinery for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson led, revenue increased to US$9 million and began the firm’s expansion in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so irreplaceable that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought Consulting’s Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded at IBM over the past three years – is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet.”
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and city management.
Regarding the field of IBM commerce, a short time ago, an "Smarter Commerce" platform has developed a platform that helps salespeople to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history also in our territory.
She established her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center of Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team responsible for speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future life.
“Pepa can come home, but not like my partner,” Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in her summer in her home, she had no idea that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned herself, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He's my sons' biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will kick him out."
“He won’t be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man I have a special relationship with,” Rychtarova said, pointing to show that she broke away from her husband but only stay in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set up a paper wedding and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk in a completely normal way but we do not sleep together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in where she's going, with whom and if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take on myself all the responsibility," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does that concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices that manage to pump the blood of the veins of men.
The purchases
Your other half makes remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy yourself at least one piece of clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of the sales?
In your case, we can talk about purchases like a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the window licker of the clothing stores, look for for yourself pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And while for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose weight at least 5 pounds - I should start playing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of something?
Yes?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more poisonous women become.
Odra and cleanliness in first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash windows, vacuum, clean floors, make dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the floor clean, to the children they have soiled the sink, clogged the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to bear in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn tracksuit in the trash."
"Are you planning on putting on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this undermine work on your partner this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think about bad you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much undermining work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflage but also insults against someone are also the proper of some women.
Women are particularly connected to relationships and so are happy to treat topics like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a small harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiful, even despise others and are for their entourage - especially at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hokeyist forward Jagr twice participated in the Philadelphia win during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals in the game.
Jagr after the match told reporters across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes goals for the puck and introduced him to scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a run, but the start of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said of his center.
“I never thought I’d play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.”
“I’m really happy with that.”
"I want to play on him."
“All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have been trying to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she finishes with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out any other complications that ended up with two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the puck, I got speed and (Read) went to the corner furthest from the cage.
“I tried to hit him and I got there,” the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came up with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he came out in the second third because of an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not hold against an experienced defender their two-butset lead lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was sick who mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost points because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We played the game only with one experienced player, the rest were young people."
“But there’s nothing to do, that’s how it is,” says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement this was not enough and we could not resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our zone."
For this we had limits, "added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender, took part in Winnipeg’s 30th attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How have travel prices changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and travels to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency agreement that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The Czechs’ travels have since seen a great revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days of vacation in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90's of the last century in the neighboring countries of the west caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example in Paris, travel organizations put Czechs to sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czechs trip was at that time to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech krona which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased, which has caused another important time around 1997.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter connections that through contracts have tremendously reduced costs compared to what was before.
By the end of the 90's of the last century, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world apart from the US, which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when was prepared the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully side in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15 000 kronor per person on holidays abroad including the ancillary charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end with a situation without a solution "one step"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without President and he risks that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic will not yet be known after yet a General Assembly to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting by-law to proceed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in leading Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football went back to differences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on September 16 when it was necessary to choose a new president.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was no question of dealing with the way of electing.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only , it appeared, the statutory representatives or also the officials vested with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the also assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue on the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerve point always remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round to not fall into the pat.
"The apple of contention lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model", noted one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round that of the candidates who have received the most votes in percentage within the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes in both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would make the bicameral concept completely refuse," admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the morave side and whoever the best would be not to change the bylaw and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he believes that the settlement of the elections established according to the statutes benefits the most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I hope that we will vote to the maximum according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are no crazy ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believe that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more enthusiasm for a cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the greatest experience in the management of football both professional and regional.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
“This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are trends in wanting to change the drawing regulations.”
"This can again cause a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I hope that the sound reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say whether the entire football management will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the torn parts of the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to battle for the position of President because he does not see any correct candidate.
If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put in the campaign for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election."
“But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate,” Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from reaching the head of the AFRT which would a priori be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in case he wins the elections he will hold this position of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they did not want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
“I would like to change this image,” he added.
What is said to be the main obstacle to Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of reverse fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates 'the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-profile trader, it would be even less favorable to football," said Paclik.
What shocks him again is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during wiretaps in the context of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away without any trouble.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".
In the event that Paclik triumphs in Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself for example as the leader of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
“I don’t put my nose into what I don’t know,” says Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke out about the cancellation of the Arbitrators’ Commission with Ludek Macela, which Dagmar Damkova replaced.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his abilities to run private firms and which he also manages since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups who tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy for the leader of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more money from the gambling tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should address."
“If it’s about the gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current affair with Plzen's club as something negative even if he himself claims that the president of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I don’t see a reason to pass on my actions from Plzen’s club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should end the situations of pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta has promised that if elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the quarrels about the settlement for elections.
The Jablonec official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success today of the football performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which was not held, promised to devote himself precisely to the national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He decided to run at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay could allow him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and waiting until Thursday there is a President.”
“They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead in the Association,” he adds, but he is primarily connected with the Jablonec club, has worked for a large number of years at the Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
That’s also why he has enough experience running Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the statutes were approved who were not perfect as all realized."
"If it were not for all these various interpretations we would have already had a President since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the full attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take full responsibility in the event that it does not work."
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he acknowledges in view of his legal training and that he knows full well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked for a long time Tonas Paclik who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and has already had some successes."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
“That’s also why some now have doubts about his character,” Pelta said to his opponent but remains, he said, true to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is according to him his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level until the national representation.
It should be a football window.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
“I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football,” the 46th candidate told Czech News Agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not bring about any change of people.
“I should get to know all the employees,” he told Strahov, where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there is a single point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will succeed in overcoming it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head,” Pelta optimistically said two days before the day, probably decisive for his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's General Assembly it would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the event that he is elected we start working hard.
He wants systemic change and to make the members of the Executive Committee accountable for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance football for young people."
“But I’m not saying I’ll do all this alone,” Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a specific area."
"And I will be distributing difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
“A lot of people won’t be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He said he would not stand for a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will keep putting sticks in my wheels and make doubts about every single one of my actions," he said.
"A lot of people told me I shouldn't give up because they would give up too."
“It’s a trust I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
“For the last two years there has been a great de facto job and I don’t want to let it down.”
“There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to arrest them,” he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union would return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta can’t do.”
“Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that he would only be for those who have been chosen.”
"I can be blamed for a number of things but surely not to support someone."
"I strive to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not just those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are any who say otherwise, I'm ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts one Czech and the other morave whose winners would find themselves in the first division."
“There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
Since Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
“I constantly feel a support from the Czech House that elected me its Vice President and knows that with me there will be successes,” said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and the gambling law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has enough to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
“If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a noticeable change among the people in the Commissions.”
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
by Julia Stanek
UFO optic paddling pools, beautiful Budapest pools: Traveling through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let rest its tired legs in sparkling water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted swimming pools.
If an indoor pool pleased her, she noted in her booklet without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal indoor swimming pools of Münich, the historic bathhouses in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She has taken her "travel to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of bathing culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimmers must simply contemplate blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach while joggers breathe bewitching scent of spruce forests or can listen to cheerful bird chisel from the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must actually be so ugly," she said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubly reinforces the architecture
A dive into a pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have gone to a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on a transparent side, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a report worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a leap into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Já
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof from the bath of Zürich you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor pool in St. John's. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which it is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and in the open air of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded ground.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was since closed.
Taking a look through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blooming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Bath Palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have come out since its conception in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a great yield to blend such different building styles into such a great unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
by Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on commodities?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has tasked a working group to seek the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials like corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions disrupt this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the stock market speculation on global commodities, pushes prices up and that banks share a complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign aligns concretely with Deutsche-Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting the same.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share in the meantime the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demands - and benefit the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no case is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake."
According to information from the SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode praised the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, how much today's banks are harming the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
“Deutsch Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the Chairman of the Board will not change anything planned on the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to care about it - his successor will be concerned.
One in two would cancel out investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30 000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute made questionnaires among 1001 people.
Just eleven percent have found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank’s clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their entourage, 49% replied that they would think about the termination of their account to change their bank.
21st House in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, glass sheds, bright and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight and suspended steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to this day as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian World's Fair.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW home and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His project of pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the World's Fair in the Swiss Garden at the South Vienna Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang artworks, so not a good environment.
However it has been used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck from any point of view.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as a figure skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she carried out the work of transformation among politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public and private sponsorship funds.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited, a café and a bookstore are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "virtually every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he was aware of the problems of the building, which lost generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a chasm in energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, glass-fibre-reinforced insulating glass was laid and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a panel of light sifted between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against rust of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as what it once was.
And all this under the close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and cheap were to be found, and that also please the protection office monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the "neighborhood of the central station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another construction Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the temporary art center Berlin, and as it says, it is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung reported beforehand by invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway facilities and docks should, among other things, double to 16,000 people.
The objective is to rid the snow and ice docks until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track devices required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Station Manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of train accidents also this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years had to do so, since it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after a rupture of axles has taken place on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of the chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up in the United States: the Frankfurt institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA brings a whole series of accusations to the major banks, and that it has encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
“We are satisfied that we were able to find a solution on this subject, without the parties initiating proceedings in court,” a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York said.
The Bank did not acknowledge any fault in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of 20.5 million dollars.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their genre.
The regulator also took other major banks to the party and in the summer he sued the JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Regarding the issue of mortgage documents, this is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the moment it is blowing on the American banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits seeking redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 major international banks, the two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for benefiting in kind when making mortgages about 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, which is several transactions totalling US$14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities are asking that the Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but, however, without citing a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as unjustified and said it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett grows by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies only reveal bad predictions.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his view on investment in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM offered primarily the provision of services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
A Warren Buffett investment is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business grants itself the right to be called "Mr. IBM" now.
Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic show, which he has bought since March IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He praised the management, who even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services as an operation of accounting centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old IT pioneer offers both Software and consulting and high-performance enterprise calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in the companies he understands business.
But on the contrary Buffett rather attacks the rail freight, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a series of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old octogenarian had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and erected it as one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM stocks grew by one percent on the stock market.
“Big Blue,” as IBM’s worth, has a stock market value of more than US$220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the world’s most valuable tech companies.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectre that was thought to have long been dead has reappeared: since the Mölln inflammatory attacks in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, but it has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "This was the title of the publication on the Internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, however, that one of the authors was a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
It is in a reasoned way that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration to the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It is with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports by some Turkish media hit the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of deriving unambiguous conditions.
"It's starting to stink," this is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the German authorities' mind to search in some suspect far-right circles, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armament."
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 90’s have explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could lead.
However, the attacks sharpened the feeling of the we in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it is mainly the failure of German policy after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be valued on the amount of his tax expenses.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German-Turks is towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of further clarification and re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake Zürich Scandal Bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has gone bankrupt almost in the financial crisis and is in the meantime skating from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July, that he would hold in 2013 an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved strength and has made kind observations about future colleagues.
"UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I am delighted with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and soared about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
from the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been considered suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank communicated Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
All of a sudden he then took responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later a bank professor in Zurich said: "I have always taken UBS as a good bank model in front of my students."
"From the current perspective, we wonder: how could I have just been so wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, who was previously considered a senior intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later we felt why he was gone.
The bank’s division had flamed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this it did indeed find investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was ignored, to the point that it was never even learned of its name.
However, this was only the first blow.
In April 2008 this got worse.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 amounts to more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
“We couldn’t save the UBS again,” said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the wealthy customer base, which had defrauded the tax authorities perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of 780 million dollars - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with a fine increased.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it has helped with tax fraud.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of money from customers.
Thus the bank had lost in a few months its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid for tax fraud.
And, as there was a little return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed by this unfortunate story of security merchants: a single merchant of title blazes 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not going round.
And we publish: with the management of risks in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: "the problem with the UBS is that it does not have control over the risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken office, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power plant in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which drives directly from Central Station to Lake Zurich, which is itself surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's, they can be found here between shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Credit Suisse Palace to private elitist banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other removed from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two major banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, it finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And even though, they have long adapted to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle like the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday the small country's governing coalition of the seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," author Lukas Hässig wrote in his book "The UBS Crash."
With up to about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Swiss - and has constantly recorded an increase.
What helped is that the two different predecessory banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with the strong point of asset management in Zurich and a poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks had a positive access to a lot of money, with which they were able to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Chief of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets along very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"This is a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always said the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to go up to the top.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it played a very important role.
Corporate advisers, who have been responsible for it, have, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Growth-huntedly grown, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed the valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages – but also retained risks.
Even when other banks had been looking for a long time to go down.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more sudden the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectible and are so far wobbly.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to investment banking, concentration to property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want (yet) to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday the head of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be transient when the bank with surprise part of its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, it has imposed itself: it must conduct the business of the UBS in the long term, said Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the progress of the mid-1990's.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly only until now that he was going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.

Smart crows spread to cities
In many places, frews are considered "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been hunted cities for a long time.
Some like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "° bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the frews of cities.
Experts from across Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected frews: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, development and felling of typical brooding trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 pairs of broods in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements because of the massacre of crows in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal clubs.
“The normal eviction, the ousting, is useless,” said Leer’s city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests with pressure water or felling trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
The ouster is only imaginable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal ousting to aversive packaging and eye-catching offers, to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was prospecting "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-chemin-chemin-educational des Carbilles at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent frews.
This project has meanwhile been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The frews not only use work instruments to arrive at a treat but they themselves manufacture their tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge were testing four frews recently, how much the intelligence of birds is.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone must have certain lumps and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a more stocky problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their booty with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four frews succeed even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a blow from the Bosniaks and the Turks remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the final tickets in the 2012 European Championships in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.

The Czechs reached the elimination return game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first set (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more hot in the 0:0 draw between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) leak against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with 11 metres-penalty played in hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his pulling qualities at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half-hour have not accomplished anything, had their first clear chance thanks to forward Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a headball directed to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech
Finally referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese yellow card (36th).
On the counter side, Stark granted an 11-meter penalty played in the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion made four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the Czechs' world-class guard already shot, again, the FC Seoul striker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the miracle of Zagreb football during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the third of EM of 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the visitors.
Ireland pushed to the next level from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defense of Estonia could have prevented a possible goal from the -first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and held the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China

“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” said Bill McDermott and his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund’s new book offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that shakes your heart.
A tip to start with: tear this page thoroughly and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this novelistic account of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here an extraordinary book that he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It has some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a “book describing what it could look like.” We find the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and salespeople.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose limbs, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives waver here like the candles of a church: while some are dying out, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
It brings a denial to the idea that the First World War is only summarized by the terrible war of the trenches on the Western front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina who stinks the cordite.
When cannon shots ring in the distance, and you are a stay-at-home mother, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Hardly anyone can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been fleshed out by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor from the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other already published documents.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them approach deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
Recounting the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on the replacement food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of crushed cooked rice in sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He claims that "837 permitted alternative meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive towards savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were destined for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in his hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When you're resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience," he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a convicted man strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming more and more a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butcher while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service to the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which the soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates to a lifetime blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way in which war has "triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion. "
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he's come up from his book, grabbed your hands this page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation remained covert of all except for a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with her presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could be no rehearsals of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, who went against the department’s settlement and spawned a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots — anti-terrorist measures that involve moving a large number of police officers quickly — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The final training session took place Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park came "at the last minute," said one regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
“The few police officers I know who have been called did not know they would go to Zuccotti Park,” the person said on anonymity.
"The only ones who know they would go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city was able to learn a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood – dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
M. Kelly said many people would come and go to the park during the day, like migrants. One hour in the morning was a good schedule.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spotlights and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The resounding lights and recorded messages of the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply rounded up their belongings and left.
No tents were hit until 1h45 said the police, leaving the occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the move was taken only for security.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, severely held by the officers.
M. Browne said the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved west across the protesters’ thick business clutter, including luggage, plastic grass and bags of leaves filled with clothes, crews from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called in to cut the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3h30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to M. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "disorder of public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer to be on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
M. Kelly, though present, "did not direct the operations," Mr. said. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
We saw the Police widen the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people to keep them away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5am, south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the condom of a police car. Others were seen digging tires from a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came up stealing from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
School aid union sues city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that lost their jobs last month, plans to file a trial in the city for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals on Wednesday. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The lawsuits are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, in an attempt to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aids, coordinators of parents and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October. The union leaders compared these layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city to access a health care fund led by the workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, mentioning that the redundancies of school aid were not specified in any way in the budget.
Officers of the 37th District Council said they would fill out a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of whom are black or Latin American in origin, like most school helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union was betting on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While no layoffs are counted on Staten Island, and just a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx neighborhoods.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aids from the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuits say that "It is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget of the public school 36 has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents’ coordinators.
The memo used the term "overtaking" to describe the action, even though "overtaking" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed", and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
It seems finally that the Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"This is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a move to reduce funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory — Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s mission management, but not enough to cut his grass under his foot.
Congressional indecision was overwhelmed by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or divide the legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Chair of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
In the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to secure a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other matter, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without having tried.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled in Congress on a wide range of issues.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to gild their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was approved last August, called for a vote by the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrats - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is being repeatedly proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be passed if two-thirds of states are opposed to them.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace slowed down from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," said Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared Monday night on a TV show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover first rather than return to Congress.
During her appearance on the television news "20/20" on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show addressed his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, said it was "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while doctors taught her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with doctors every day, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for the first time for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated while awaiting trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
“So I would say, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been beaten,’” Kelly said.
You were just slaughtered.
And you're gonna get away with it, get some food and come back even stronger than ever.
More mercy than respect for the troops
The event: A Wall Street Gala to raise millions of dollars for New York City’s homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in suit-ties stood at his feet to cheer him.
“The military, both men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer present at the gala, in which Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, also participated, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the senior military official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect. Just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is acting more and more as if he is sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who has led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds.”
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognizable or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most pity conversations take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the fight with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were making him interviews subtly asked if he would be able to hold the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about the service, you’re faced with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian said when he spoke to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely bleaked by such an unfamiliar country with the military and which sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as we do for World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of a soldier’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction on rape.
If so, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
1st-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, thrown to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others will anxiously await the court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rape within the army, thus going against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 months after – 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's going after the gleaned military, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs together in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, headed by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 50's.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in getting in touch with local women.
The result: of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situation.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in fighting this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center prepares a case against the four main military academies for supposedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the military, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to handle claims for benefits for those who report being the victim of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were introduced in Congress through a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also examines the percentage of lawsuits: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the military were tried – half of the percentage of the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Susan Burke's case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell her about her rape 11 times in detail to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was delivered,” said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court.”
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember telling my commander, 'It wasn't his trial but mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed under less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Will the Lyman case and other plaintiffs move forward or not, it's a long history, says John Turley, a professor of law at the University of Washington's Faculty of Law.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army finds itself decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavily against them... but it’s important that they try,” he added.
These things only change when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trial.
“We will continue to fight the military on this issue until there is reform,” she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a deadly madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, talking to some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Connect to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t that hard to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way mercatics have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team has discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right bands in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked were about their level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
By coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "Like", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the "data supernova" generates a search explosion, increasing the number of search work whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter,” Bartlett said.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information. "
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were far more likely to be alcoholics than discrete students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would speak too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behaviour and Child Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be recognized in another case."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The team at the site that handles the data studied statistics about the love situation and Valentine’s Day, the turnout in the 2010 midterm elections and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available – digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it is quite another thing online.
“I don’t believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile,” said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, according to a 2006 study he conducted while observing his students’ Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notebook and pen remain the best tools that can be used.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social is not in front of a computer."
"Cold and Inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he told a courtroom full of 500 people.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to detain Breivik for another twelve weeks, banned him from talking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About thirty relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
“I found him cold and inhumane,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally moved a little forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and walked out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a large movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may be comforting some of them.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
“I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it’s not,” said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, at the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be released this week in the opening part of a movie in major markets, is how much that creative mind understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organizational improver - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease let them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This slightly rebounded video is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to speed up him and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision for the future of IT.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
He explains them and then the implementations in a row.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"All these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to elaborate on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed about how costs were recorded - we often start with a "standard cost" evaluated at a nose view, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick on the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack the phone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The device has been the subject of many writings beforehand, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world. "
We didn’t know much about the two of us, but we knew how to invent a small thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell a wonderful trick that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love with technology (and canvassing Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“It had a remarkable influence on me. “It was the only company I’d seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated.”
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first ever-designed desktop.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode-ray tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles down to sell a few circuit boards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... I was shouted at pretending that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that was incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders were going to be wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it’s these types of people] that end up running companies and product-specialized personnel are sidelined from decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine conceiving a good product in relation to a bad product - the required manual labor.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have made its current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90's...
They snatched defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... As you develop this idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are some compromises to make... Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made for personal taste. It’s about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you’re creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal some great ideas.
This is part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with opponents of health law as the court meets
The day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to examine the issue of political discord, namely whether opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases in question involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges have agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental argument of 5h30 is expected next March, and the result will probably be likely to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming at the time when the court decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue about the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, there was Mitch McConnell, the Senate’s top Republican and a declared opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing wrong with the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would no doubt argue by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raising of organizations related to the law and others although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appearing on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court is following the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, chairman of Common Cause.
“Judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disassembles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a Solicitor General of the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
Her critics have lobbied for Kagan to recuse to hear the case, saying she has been too involved in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record 18 billion dollar order for airliners
Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-corride airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
On the other hand, this is a whole thing when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that Middle East airlines will need in the next 20 years 2 520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars.
Over the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 two-corridors.
Emirates, based in Dubai, placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to US$26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that flatters significant fuel savings and passenger amenities.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
“It’s clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own a lot of their airlines.
They therefore have the means to pay for these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them since the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora reported.
“They have a natural risk cover,” he said.
Emirates’ order reinforces Boeing’s dominance in the widebody aircraft market and helps curb the Airbus competitor’s encroachment attempt with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautics show came four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its debut to increase its push following the demand of its customers to increase its charging capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares grew 1.5 percent to US$67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president obviously beaten in the elections of the Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to take over the duties of governor of the Michoacán in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the top of the race for the governorship of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not just for the Michoacán but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview the Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They seized the polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have distinguished himself only by little from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother’s conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the elections a mayor of the PAN was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man we are waiting to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
ASDB urges Asia to come to the euro area to help
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone emerge from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the director general of Manila-based ASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and noted that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe emerge from the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the eurozone has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The thriving sovereign debt crisis in Europe has caused fears that the global economy will return to recession, and has sparked the call of the major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
M. Nag foreshadowed that the IMF would deliver any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans as they face their own significant economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid to the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on 2 dollars a day, or even less.
“One day, they will discover that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and that they are going on holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek civil servants in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
M. Nag said the eurozone crisis could cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The ASDB forecast for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 is now facing "loss risks" due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to “develop “contingency plans” to protect themselves from economic turnaround and significant capital flight.
Strong Pentagon warnings about potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already digesting 450 billion dollars in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional US$600 or more of cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an expense deal.
“The impacts of these reductions would be devastating to the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach a resulting budget agreement in so-called kidnapping would lead to 23% of cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, thus indiscriminately applied, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable – you cannot purchase three-quarters of a ship or vessel – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal.”
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
“Although wartime funding of overseas contingency accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the severe disruptions in core budgets,” Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war."
“Salary management staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline by the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta’s letter was published.
“This is not a consequence we can live with, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself has reached the Pentagon’s highest post with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen — a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter jet, without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of completing the mission,” Panetta said in her preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
"This is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"De facto, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable assumed risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cleaver, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
The list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate US$80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step towards improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how ubiquitous deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York City congressman and internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, passed for an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by compelling evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of campaign funding violations related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of the people who lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked while lying in his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on the school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students in order to be clear about their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or identifying lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charads, where the goal is to exclaim: "I've had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They do not stutter, blush or agitate always.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can uncover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial microexpressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation, or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies “centered on them” while women say more lies “centered on others” – usually to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "establishing benchmark data".
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally stirs their feet permanently so that you don’t make unfair charges when you see them moving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of deceptive verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Think of these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean towards a way out, change posture significantly, or present a “post-interview” relief – an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change in posture when all the difficult questions are gone.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skidded using the past while pretending that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distant language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval from the United States
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico — angering unions while soothing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval from a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, vast underground water sources.
“It’s a real path forward,” said Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska on Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have pushed back any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials deny the policy’s involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed his support.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, he would have to go through six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the 20 000 jobs estimated related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only pose limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the Department's Inspector General has ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear
A New York family says the diva Disco Patti LaBelle thrown into a rampage of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she threw up fear.
The singer's tirade "Lady Marmalade" frightened 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, so much so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "the increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was on November 10 last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife a kindergarten teacher Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk went to get the car, Roseanna Monk walked down into the lobby of their Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said "yes" and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle angerfully admonished the pregnant woman.
“She told me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter by the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "What you say or think doesn't interest me."
She became rabid and began to use swear words - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who still held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who dragged her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against childhood cancer.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,” said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators.
Low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillion losses for the agricultural sector, limited the state economy's growth opportunities, caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of allocations by the Jellies from the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which a 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year there was an accelerated increase, because from January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate has continued to increase to July to March 55 thousand 053 menA rate that represents more than 74 thousand unemployed Sinaloens, an increase from the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we’re seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, between which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a resource restriction by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars in an illicit way is not easy for them to work to earn them, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people who abandon the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment rises,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinalo labour market worsens by considering the high level of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to the INEGI, the 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's lag is low wages, the entity has the lower remunerations of the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of the Sinalian workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Aside from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the FDI of the State reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the State Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, mainly registered by companies in the service sector.
The debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, the State Government requested in July the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November there was no profit of the debt.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, herein included the State Government.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we had to align the effort of all and especially the already synchronized smooth running of this new government team, hope that next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said that events like the frosts at the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and have restricted its yield and growth.
“The low economic flow is produced from several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close a lot below the expectations we had,” he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that it is desired to channel the state towards more productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that we have been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of Sinaloa’s material and human resources,” he said.
Many to do
The President of the Coparex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still much to be done," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Public Prosecutor General of the Republic has informed that the convicted little trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crime against health, in his variant possession of marihuana intended for sale.
In accordance with the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving in a white pick-up truck in which he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle’s rack and on the co-pilot’s square a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of the Crimes.
Debts to contributions to books
Social works contemplated in programs such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished where serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although so far the construction programmes have progressed, they are in a risk situation, because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide the 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
“They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end they haven’t given us anything, even though since July they had to give us some of it,” he says, “and we, in order not to record delays, we started the books and we’ve made a lot of progress, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to apply for an appropriation to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
“We had already undergone this in the previous sex-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid for,” he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing.”
Court validates "analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important exchanges that the world has suffered in the last few years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have made against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree which details the actions to be taken to concretize the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, developed by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and admit the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the Ministers also resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures through general standards to ensure that the public administration is prepared for it.
"I also only consider whether it does so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the state leadership.
The substitution of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Adjourning change, he argued, would postpone the benefits of digitalization that involves a public interest decision that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state, encompasses a group of responsibilities that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State."
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already finished the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have the highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has invaded in a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
We analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes of the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" count is a reality with regard to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication within the time limits provided for by the Law of the Official Gazette of the State.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the state’s proxy’s proxy vote for constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because it has no right to “sanction or challenge them.”
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to carry out the biased and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packets, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no ballot minutes and counting in the record of the ballot block is not found in the president of the ballot room; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all ballot boxes in the election may be made where there is an indication that the difference between the assumed candidate winning the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates.
The total counting of the vote can also be realized if at the end of the joint count it results that the difference between the supposed candidate winner and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party from which the candidate has emerged second, in which case the electoral packets which have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said that he had even a truckail; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion on which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, for this he knows that his uncle is dying doing what he loved most in life: fly an aircraft.

Three abandoned corpses, located in the Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had presented to the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for offences relating to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered with fire in different parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at kilometer 1.5 drive from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the beige color and coffee the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; at his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue-colored jeans.
The three were lying on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because no shell casings were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a group of delinquency organized towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 people, between which a minor, who formed part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have a relationship with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the published information, in a first fact on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of their liberty was able to be saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 6:00 a.m., military personnel made a surveillance journey in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the verge of economic disaster
Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of economic disaster and jeopardized the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he would present the president with the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner for Journalists said.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The "frame is now well traced," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the trust in Italy that had been affected.
By highlighting the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets has placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s opportunities for success have been greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis has forced to resign last Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts will have a good result,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the government of technocrat majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches has added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish his meeting tour Tuesday at night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who has able to transition extremely quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defenses of Eurozone.
Monti said his Government should persist until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give it time to apply the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, a hint of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties make it difficult to try to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is higher than that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for the friendly of today, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, count a wide range of inter-selection games of class A, the Habs only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain an intense year's activities in national league and cup championships and disputes in European Cups like the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience limited to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the bigger record of the Spanish Selection is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international games.
Casillas will play today against the Habs and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral flyer of Barcelona, is 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the centre-forward of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Loan of the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have passed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While only Nacho Moreal has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
The historic goal scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
""Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to perform in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 19:30 hours, next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcription of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to spend a few days there.
So it makes us feel emotional about bringing our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity on previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying next to us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the larger shows we have offered in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered a two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very much looking forward to doing this.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we never performed there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this to be?
I think it's partially because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reason we loved these songs and we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
In the first place, I believe that none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue to make music together is very emotional.
We love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't get better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that arose.
It is also very strange that a group like yours keeps united and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
In the first place, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t get better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We have been a band for almost three years and we have not released a record before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it has lasted so little and most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song where I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
What do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's the one who sings it and I think he's doing it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge up despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have arisen at the same time and, if it comes up now, I think it’s wonderful, because it’s a music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music than ever before.
At first, his music had more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change for?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow up and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these songs, no doubt, represent that for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make obscure music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he has in the magpies, his family doctor informed.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and the loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has had four times tongue cancer surgery, he has weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and foot circulation problems, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of various ministers and bosses, will initiate this Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long meeting agenda with political, trade authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community resident in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propious for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a declaration that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of his ambassador of this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of emerging and developed countries that are stronger in the world, and has been in effect with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to dispatch the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "gri list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustached plumber switches to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of young people in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at everyone’s stores, was designed from the beginning to make good use of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who must say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” said Oman Álvarez, Nintendo’s specialist press manager in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", because so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a quick and smooth part.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to make a "second round" at the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario into the three dimensions also presupposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a nod to the followers of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachious plumber must browse peril-mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even if I play find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves of Portillo extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given orders for the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the money laundering of 70 million US dollars.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the country of the north that called for Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom affirmed that his decision is governed by the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term "he did not help" in any judicial resolution and he had given rise to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did requires an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former agent from the interval 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzling Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
To this is added the long centenary of workstations currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats that more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the goal of helping people with little training, without work, with substance abuse problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Next to the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
Also attended in the great hall of Fabra i Coats the current Minister of Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it carries out,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-feasts, evacuated
The invaders had adapted 11 of the building's 13 apartments, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of the number 51 of Balmes Street were living has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned at noon yesterday the building they occupied illegally and where they organized micro-feasts that despaired the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From this day on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited -, were carried away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the mass festival scene, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building occupied his business has dropped an 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair skill, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by the customers of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants of the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the trouble was so great that it even resulted in an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since the latter "forgives" him the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) has also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of living in common and civic that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights too.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end with impunity and be relentless against the anti-social behavior generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police moved to number 35 of Rue Mont-ral, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide with the desirability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Around the mid-80's, in the midst of the climax of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all the access doors to Collserola.
A door goes to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both with regard to its organization and regarding the reflection on the city is a theme of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who have presented themselves there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to debate" on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the pâtés of green houses was not carried out at the end.
"It must start from the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect for whom the title of "portes de Collserola" contains a "lexicon trap": we must not think of these "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban planning world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "a few perils".
From the perils that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in the '80's and which had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which we can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step", that is, its overcoming.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GGP) ] can cause authentic disasters."
By sticking more to the question, Modol opines that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola which "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he hears that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct that architects allow to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile is to lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a whole success", he says) that we had to create: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because bases of the competition are missing a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 transversal competitions - he says - in the direction of the mountain-sea, but there is not a longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole."
This means, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that carries out a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal power ground of Casino Red granted the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After passing 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red grants him the pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of an economic quot for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine functioning of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and kept in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was issued a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the corruption and organized crimes.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center presumably for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half of pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention center as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an order of capture was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás's guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the official of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who partners of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under file 197/2011 the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim for the trial against him is granted; he will not be asked for any compensation for damages and no punishment.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, travelled to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be closed.
He will also communicate to her the immediate order of freedom that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and another seven people lost his life
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) has informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people lost his life, indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so it met the requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations done in the impact zone do not report the appearance of floor parts.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact presented itself structurally.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a swire of seven to 30 degrees inclination.
For the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, General Manager of Aéroports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Maggiore State was operating in speed of cruising and this happened on an uphill soft ground.
“This information supports the hypothesis of normal functioning cruiser at the time of impact,” he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical normative, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM indicated adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft progressed to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low-level cloudiness.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the cloud conditions the crew sought an area of lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Localization of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last aircraft record on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft's remain dispersion model assumes that the helicopter has collided against the ground under structural integrity conditions.
Traces of fire or explosion were not detected:
In the disaster location there is still no trace in the aircraft remains of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the fieldwork, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a slope that had been going from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in a larger area than the encircled location, around the accident, dispersed parts of the aircraft were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the "Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents" protocol that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 20th Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation is invited to participate the population entitled or not, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the evidence is carried out to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sporting Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After achieving the goal of raising 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sport Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that of knowing the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identifying risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of familial heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays will apply anthropometric measurements (weight, height, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (seeks to identify people associated with childhood obesity) will be applied to all participants.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there was an increase in the 77 percent in obesity and in the case of 47 per cent girls in the case of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed," said the IMSS specialist.
He said the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American heredity, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral evaluation of children, which makes it possible to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila even says that the presence of dark colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic and even pre-diabete alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, physicians give it in writing to the parents, to whom each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they must make to prevent disease is explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of going on foot on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the greatest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat pâté with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrant
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the reports that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrant each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt paver is adequate, the blackcurrant could be reduced or even eliminated.
During his conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, he signaled, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles pass through it by generating forces, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, stubbornly stumble.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a last layer is put called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
Being the part of the block that receives and distributes the forces, the rolling layer also requires that the latter have an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be neat.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes blackcurrant.
In the trial of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that spoils is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of Valle miss to be the new miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her title number 14 princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for the fact that she was on the podium of the winners, wear the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico climbed with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums up 14 titles of Princess and Melina one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borre (1949)83), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people have is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision of the juror to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I believe that it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The little prince", it is a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This answer did not like first of all because of the term "to cultivate" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen happens.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Between the hypotheses launched is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Customer cuisine challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not shine on the scene."
And this was noted in his first presentation in the swimsuit at Hilton beach and his two parades of the day before the coronation.
Even though at both parades she had seemed confident on her own, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Como en casa" program (As at home), of the RCN Canal said that the fact that Melina was named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not managed to convince the jury about its interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a committed woman regarding her country’s social necessities.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects from his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left him points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition presents for the first time, after the show in a swimsuit came a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo gave to Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, if not as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typist went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past November 4 a Cita ITC dactyloscopist has made history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses that were to be identified were located.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having taken adequate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected was that of the man who ran the oldest guerrilla in the world, therefore he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the corpse, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant from the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In search of the fingerprint
For a Typediologist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Typing is an exact science, without margin of error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying the corpses, the typists support the investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher said that in one case of theft he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint with the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts,” he recalls.
Prints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
For the purposes of the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be a suspect of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the murderer, it puts him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI typist explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a sampler or a band is used to remove them.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declinquents, or the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is how one shows in the television program CSI.
Since everything that shines is not gold, everything that one touches does not necessarily become an imprint.
However, it can be used, if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
‘Indignants’ Defy Authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were jostling in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
Many of the people have accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The Integrals of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied Tuesday the authorities of New York by trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, in the place of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were jostling in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows the 'indignant' to camp in this place again, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp in the square again, we’re going to move to another place and we’ll continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,” said one of the spokesmans for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the "indignant" response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street power stations and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are centenarians of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property compound - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation is to be analysed.
A few of the protesters displaced until then carried and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time and they even delivered it to the agents who were monitoring the square, which caused 'some small clashes,'" said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the protesters.
The judiciary prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing 'laws published after the start of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they used to use.'
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, because of the judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, to whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to settle down with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the place to evacuate because it became “a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people,” because “some stores had received threats” and residents were afraid “for their quality of life.”
“This morning’s evacuation at dawn was repugnant and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman said, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Officials at "Occupy Wall Street" also said they do not plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protest, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas television program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 performing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a nursery a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian-Canadian comedian who recently featured part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is himself not far from controversies.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is rising one 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ending the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, convalescent even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the Japanese country since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's first estimates have calculated the US$300,000 million property losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page definitively: GDP raised one 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6% in annualized rates.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also implies the greatest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to the decrease of the 0.9% of capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable has raised a 1%, pushed by the increase in vehicle spending, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “safe haven values” elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in Eurozone and the forecasting unrest of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low results between July and September the yen’s contribution.
While markets continue to seat in the peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower its guard.
"We must follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods of Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it has dropped four decimal places up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below average, which is in the 100 level, falling eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellene Transitional Government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, reported yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of a hundred days established in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections for the date.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of October 26," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the Civil Disciplinary Code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras no outweighs doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything more."
The Conservative leader has gone a step further in its pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently requires, and has made it clear that it will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the va-tout of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellene parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "predominant" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a global predominant place in the role of micro-finance".
Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that has as its goal the reduction to half of the volume of people who live with incomes under a dollar a day, to which is set the "power"
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is envisaged not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which it is necessary to impel "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are emerging from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her policy of loans.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I could see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualifier of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid from the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía finished her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Etique imperative"
Foreign Affairs Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is a etique imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, it has stated that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and do not allow it to be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to the "excluded people to whom all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned for the programme but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, gave no room to doubt.
The idea-master of the Chancellor - and the motion - holds in one slogan: the response to the crisis "is no less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen EU control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, the inspirator of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is laid.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight the weight of each country on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to strengthening Germany's weight.
Anxious to calm the climate inside her party, the chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe enshrines a paragraph on the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Sick Stoppage Fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15 to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistantship.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in a context of rigor, but is no less herald of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First for the purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking care of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that is likely to arouse anger, but that would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants one day of uncompensated deficiency in the event of a stoppage of work (they have so far no waiting period, against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will refund," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's focus first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% concerned maternity and accident leave at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day of sick leave.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of sick leave were less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that controls are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term shutdowns were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of "unsuitable or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, therefore, 169 000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little in front, for example, to that of black work.
According to the deputy UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax shortfall per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece to implement new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to turn around its economy.
That was what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told Parliament on Monday, November 14, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos has forecast that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday gave his support to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
“We will not vote in favour of new measures,” he said at a meeting with his party’s MPs, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of deficit and debt reduction, and the fight against waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary 8 billion euros loan without written guarantee of all the parties they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, report by the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for this.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is required, with a patient who is deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, the experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, from the country, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consensual persons.
On the contrary, said yesterday by teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, there are more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, respondents estimate at 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or leaving care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the report’s authors say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Finally, when it comes to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the findings of the report of the experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts signatory to the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
“This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help to be killed,” said Deschamps, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
Now, "in society, he says, there are beacons and constraints."
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called a "pro-euthanasia protest."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the premises of the Foreign Ministry.
Diplomatic pressures on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russian support, resists them and denounces a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, took a stand in favor of a departure of President Assad.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria where about 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces were killed again.
“If Bashar was keen on his country’s interest, he would have to resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country for which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking on an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have died in the southern Syrian region of Draaa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.
Two other civilians perished "in exchanges of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis."
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not bend," he added, assuring that "the plots against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's crackdown, which he said is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the plan of exit from the crisis decided on November 2 and providing in particular for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the grip of the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that the Arab League's decision was "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU commissioner was in discussion with political parties yesterday before meeting today with trade unions and employers.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of parliament from one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the president of the Council-designate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are specific deadlines” for preparing a government and its agenda, he stressed, saying it is “certain that the markets will be patient and understand.”
Its appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern has regained the upper hand especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should be a team of mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
M. Monti pledged, once taken office, to work urgently and with the aim that Italy "becomes a protagonist again" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its budget balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new measures of rigour.
Italian bosses Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect deficit parameters."
M. Monti, renowned for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "era change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, largely drawing on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and was allegedly involved in the explosion-based synthetic diamond factory.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims rose nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% increase, against an increase of 13% in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen very slightly to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% motivated by racial differences and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disruptive to see these crimes and crimes increase again,” the human rights organization Human Rights First said, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious human rights violation,” said Paul Legendre, a senior official.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, adding that it could go through improved police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now gender.
Twitter is changing its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more readably, live the activity of other "Twittos", the Internet users whose messages we follow ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they are forwarding messages, signing up for new accounts, having favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of insiders, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating "tweets" decided on the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some of the elements of my Twitter feed,” @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
inscription of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of the grand coalition of the ruling Social Democrat/Christian Democrat in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" of budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration by the rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s creditworthiness was lowered by only one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in extra interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, deputy chancellor and Christian strike minister.
Austria is thus following a request from the Brussels summit of the eurozone member countries of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The operative part adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets in equilibrium.
The objective is to increase the public debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
“We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, said. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of vigor since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has been steadily raised since, boosted by purchases from investors who consider it a "safe haven value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back under the 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro was around 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago's exports because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign income by Japanese firms, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Northeast Tohoku region, said Mr. Noda who fears that this rising yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economic power returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households leaded by the disaster.
But the prime minister said the high price of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), increasing to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling on the amounts it devotes to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
rates are rising, stock markets are failing
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines the European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of vulnerable countries continue to rise.
Still worried for the stability of the euro zone, the European stock exchanges sink a little more into negative territory, this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yielded 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new tensions on the bond yields of struggling euro area states, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are all too aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7 percent, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow variation corridor as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is trading at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth US$1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, meeting in congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the return on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has called for time for the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with suffocation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain finds itself in the line of sight of the markets, while Sunday parliamentary elections are held in the country.
The spread gap between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new all-time high.
Pending the euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is really the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11am, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an electoral meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear power holds in them.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight against climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is neither the case of Belgium, which is subjecting its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only state-of-the-art power plants.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality thwarts discourse.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence exacerbated by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a jump in CO2 emissions driven by the construction of gas and coal-fired power plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
European wind champion, from which he draws 30% of his electricity, he is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of the wind; according to which, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the fine statements on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show an opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show it.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 jobs induced.
Strongly exporting, it leads a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative of non-relocable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing as a skin of sorrow the 6 billion euros annual of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to work sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of production of miracle electricity, nor is there any diabolical.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a safety authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing plants as well as on the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the previous two.
The result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German security authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, the stoppage of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the way clear to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers to dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "countries of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can not accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paying for electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarizing the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and hurting employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants risk replacing national workers, particularly the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly in occupations in sectors with employment shortages.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national wage earners, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not track jobs.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country that is experiencing a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make it possible to arrive immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (less expenditure revenue) of 150000 euros to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to go for the points of growth missing "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, by serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember it, which, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient, for democracy to triumph definitively from its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even be made "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, a separation and a control of powers, an education, the Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all a crisis in politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic combat have now moved, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer pulling in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessities and in dispersed order.
A white-seing to the European absolute monarch or a jump joined in the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cleaves but an exercise, common, by right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore popular sovereignty to the steering of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The end of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After having long fought this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for the European economic government.
Be.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new stage in European integration.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson is still valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are becoming widespread
The world smart card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should indeed be completed on an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader’s card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold around the world, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for nearly 10% of the overall smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long lagging behind in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the supermarkets put the double bites.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard pass cards this year.
To move up a gear, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French establishments have committed to systematically distribute to their customers bank cards equipped for contactless in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, managing director Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the necessary NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to carry out transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally experience a real boom next year."
“We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Societe Generale, too, said yesterday to prepare the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is expanding
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-suspected, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
“The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence services’ reports show that there is cooperation,” he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their captors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerien investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls made directs several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerien who has stayed at length in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to AQIM and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect has external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" have been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its modus operating procedures, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and of the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened people who are not very worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in hausasa means "western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is a rapid success.
It is politicizing itself and demands strict respect for Sharia law while its activists engage in the fight against the unholy central government.
The latter are aimed first at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invades the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will become radicalized and leave its northern strongholds.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram attacks the secure headquarters of the police during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia to Nigeria is now of concern to all security specialists.
While AQIM has invested Mali and Niger, which al-Shebab’s Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, in a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the intelligence".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplism and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsupported - are emerging.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race to nominate the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese in front of the WTO and question them "for manipulating their currency", a promising theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire swathes of his industry to Asia.
Too bad if it has to involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flatters” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, displays an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently unaware that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes on Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine when it came to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the overly precipitous departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, thus sticking him with a label of weakness.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers the national security record of Obama, who eliminated bin Laden, rather positive.
From Iraq, she is wary of military interventions that lead to bogged down.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama strikes more accurately.
Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly to Russia by moving to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with radiance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands Mark Rutte have together turned the wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site has the air of victory.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will indeed make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to the West European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a breach between Europeans in the East and the West.
Russia has, in just five years, made its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, heavily gas-consuming, and whose deposits are in decline triumph.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon, inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete sheathed steel to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures also had to be stepped up to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but project officials gave up while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company permanently established off their coast.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to experience a leak every 100 000 years.
The monitoring of the condition of the gas pipeline is provided by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, at a time wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it delivers precise information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repair.
The flow of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) were joined.
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty years renewable, all the capacity to transport gas.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided at 30% by the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to go into their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that is coming, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its rectangular black cover, elastic, off-white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (skin of mole) which designates a varnish cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back to life an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, his consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early stages, has almost 100 today and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has imposed her identity.
“We followed the air of the time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified his products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a range of supports.
A success that made envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled is opening today.
Despite a proactive public policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. "
"The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. "
"There is still a lot to be done. "
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many barriers before they have access to employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students of higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that particularly complicate the return to employment, and that "constitute the knot of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
Still the unsaid, the mentalities that evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "over-representation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual deficients".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, which date back to 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, managing director of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, increasing 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has only praise to do about him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to move forward," said the Lille.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and selection, "it's a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Fornig against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Without omitting, however, the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a supporter,” he said.
Obviously, this contributes to further strengthening the "special" nature of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crossed paths earlier."
"To be able to play against them is nothing but happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens spoke of "pride".
"Pride" to play "a gala match".
"Pride" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that France has "come again a very high level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a job of thunder," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well shared the plane with the Blues towards... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
“You’ll see it in the next few games.” The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimism its dam back against Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the go, both teams had lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to debound.
In view of the first leg (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, certainly, but he was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved him.
"It's a good result, but it carries some risk because we didn't score a goal away"
But at home, in their luminous Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there also boiling, even if the game is obviously "very tight", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We expect a very close game, but we are quite convinced that we can take over,” the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroz’s successor said in a statement.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, which however carries a certain risk because we have not scored a goal away," regrets Bento.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the start so as not to give them time to think. "
A good idea, if you are realistic this time.
