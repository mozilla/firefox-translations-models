Inflation in Europe has slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices, in the 13 countries of the euro area, was greater compared to the forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, said the statistics office of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have only reported 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the interest rate by saying that the decline in interests, with the growth of primer prices and the fall in the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "it is necessary to deter" inflation in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereals futures market ratings have increased by 88 percent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price rose by 52 percent and last month a barrel of black gold cost almost US$100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a crisis of the government
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December. Thus since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Polling Institute) has never seen such weak socialist support before, namely 13 percent.
For fidele voters, the difference would represent, because of the greater determination of the voters of the opposition, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
On voters who are so fond of voting, the number of supporters of both parties has increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low point, the proportion of those who have judged that the economic situation of the country is particularly serious has never been higher, it is rising to 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook for last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only a tenth predicts an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, said the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than good.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister and 27 percent trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that discontent with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 percent of those polled wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, currently this rate is only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
To the question concerning the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly go to vote and the additional 20 percent said that they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent complementary would probably participate. According to the current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education enrollment fees, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital expenses.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters, respectively, would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year is the difference that this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a significantly higher value increase of one thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already soared" in the grocery stores last December, no longer rose sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 forints, at a minimum, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was at 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forints.)
Unicum and live fish prices remained almost at the level of last year, however prices for the turkey net, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread of one kilo a 139 forints were found only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle recorded included.
He only prevents this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her Daily Shopping Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year's most expensive basket and this year's cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent difference while the difference between the cheapest of last year and this year's most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1 480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1 206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the VAT rate increase was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process perplexed trade, hypermarkets could not visibly determine which margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily shopping cart prices has evolved in such an excessive way that the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than the value of 2006 while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was greater than 1 630 forints than last year and the prices of the cheapest increased by 1 284 forints as well.
As we moved closer to the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items rose by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some basic necessities, the statistics institute has seen a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by barely more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the sudden increase in prices also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long shelf food in pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important queues formed at the crates of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the provinces, many multinationals complain to polling companies not to even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
Hospital hygienic conditions, insufficient number of beds, overwork of medical staff do not help block infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also making the economy on disinfectants
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured woman of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital but shortly after he had to return because of an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do a significant operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National System of Hospital Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Namely that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry the bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their noses without it developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a well-antibiotic-resistant bacteria that will quickly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, small weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find an MRSA only the or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the nursing staff is putting on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and seniors' residences, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological collection is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases are only born if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological harvesting is even rarer in outpatient care and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that the proliferent MRSAs of one patient has another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, significant deficiencies are also identified in hospitals in this area.
MRSA proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to the conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemics, the patients should be away from each other by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the patients are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable manner or the proliferation of the pathogen may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why this infection is being tackled everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) raises among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who had a fatal accident, was not drunk
The official finding of the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was drawn up.
He can be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since, who has crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizzy, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the public minister of the capital after the relative observation was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself facing him when he turned, with his personal car, in the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(By the way, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Traffic Act a car that initiates a turn must allow pedestrians to pass through.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the commissioner resigned from his position and he asked for his retirement because, according to the communication of the police, this accident upset him very much.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Prosecutor's Office in charge of the Budapest investigations.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
An additional 400 million euros for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements worth a total of 400 million euros on a credit line on Friday to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of 300 million euro for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects from the Cohesion Fund, a credit agreement worth 100 million euro of which has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The agreement on the appropriation of 150 million euro also concerns the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of 300 million euros for Hungary, the remaining 150 million euros will be able to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft of metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible amendment of the initial contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the metro funding with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of 8.4 billion euro for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations according to the interest rate related to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commitment fee.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned towards this country of the Balkans little cited in the past.
What, or who buys in this market of the EU which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more of them are looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik also.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also more and more numerous to buy in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the space of shops and offices promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are still looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others are coming from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. At the edge of the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers split into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The people who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, has a price ranging between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, has a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteres are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a big city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes second home buyers (since last December, Bulgaria is cited among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realizing a capital gain in the medium or long term.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly rising due to increasing demand.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in property prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of professionals are coming to an end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap that is supposed to define efforts to focus on the period of emission reductions set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are strong discussions on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The U.S. also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss accurate figures, while they were ready to sign an agreement on the reduction, until 2020, greenhouse gas emissions of 25 to 40 percent from the 1990 level.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
An agreement has also been signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The assistance fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member Governing Council probably under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) reported.
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent before 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the successful signing of the "Agreement after 2012", and it was ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make commitments adapted to their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time made a commitment on 8 percent less.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Minister of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place in the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was highlighted in the new report of IPCC, the international scientific body, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize, which is responsible for addressing climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
The units of the British army communicate, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to make themselves popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special teams working in Afghanistan in charge of video footage of the operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the headquarters of the operations of the air force in Kandahar and they are then transferred to London or the compatriots charge them on the Internet.
The political message is essential
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 footage on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British defence minister registered under the name "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and he is communicating videos about operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the Air Force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the defence minister, they were also used to make known to the general public the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this route costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment commercials spent on television, the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, told the BBC. On the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is stamped because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
Moreover, many videos had already appeared on the net presenting the areas of operation in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been racing for these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently using the America's Army shooting game downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers in the context of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffles and doughnuts in the ministers
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking doughnuts and coffee.
Another minister will organize a fete with live music, yet another will delight officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Fete, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, thus is entertained the power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas feed will be organized by the defense minister but it is not the employees of the minister who will be invited.
At Christmas, orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in the foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The minister plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministers, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Minister of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM feat will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4 320 000 forints and, out of the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this feat, the atmosphere of Christmas will be de rigueur, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost 4 700 000 forints and was organized Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The rental of the room cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas feat which is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, company managing tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the official.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building welcomed not only the NFÜ but the Minister of Justice and Police who, instead of a Christmas party, organized a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
This ball was five hundred people.
The feast began with the minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dance party on live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: the evening outfit was not mandatory at all at this ball.
Health, labour and local government ministers are preparing a sober feast.
The health minister will organize a show and a feast to his employees, within its walls, for 400 000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not invite his collaborators officially to a Christmas party but has a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have coffee and eat doughnuts, said the press service, the fete will cost only 350 000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the aula of the Minister of Local Authorities and Land Use Planning.
The Minister of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas feed in his large room with 436 employees expected.
It plans to spend 2 500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year of the same way.
No expected festive atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the feast taking place in the afternoon.
The Minister of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas feed will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the Town Woods, and according to the communication of the minister, 1 000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Education and Culture do not make a feast at all for Christmas, said the respective press services.
The Minister of the Environment's press service was not aware of the price of the official Christmas feed.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega-encils are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute, Friday, their strike commission which will be responsible for the coordination of the strike indefinitely on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams because the rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also be encumbered until 1pm.
The Unions of the league will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike of Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's shares.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health insurance funds, the unions will immediately withdraw the appeal at the encumberment.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the committees of encle will meet and decide on the continuation to be taken.
According to Monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health insurance funds will not take place until late at night.
Due to the strike planned for Monday, significant traffic jams are planned in traffic: the railways will stop work indefinitely and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are likely to be stopped.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the path will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call at the encle, the list of these is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations report striking for an indefinite period, others have declared a temporary job stop.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) have not managed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but, in the approach of the Christmas feasts, more and more are those who take the train.
According to current communications, Budapest's public transport will be subject to the start of service until 1pm, Budapest Airport between 7am and 9am, the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will make a four-hour end, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called to be encumbered respectively for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Association of Physicians will be attended throughout the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning statement.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year will be introduced in several stages.
The third claim wants a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, which would make it possible to put the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Minister of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company reports that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary.”
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is likely to provoke this situation, is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the case of the Roma to the representatives of radical and extreme political groupings who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national association of self-defense".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents to defense missions (disasters, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by referring to the inability of the police, the army, in other words of the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the resentment of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions in a civil aspect.
The emphasis on the civil character and the status of association therefore serves only as to avoid the legal traps of the registration of these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma unrest that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to be a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense."
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have "terrified" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had provoked heated debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the formation of their own guard as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat of the same way by organizing their own self-defense, according to the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request for information from the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The feat is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of the feast and, around the festies, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The parties are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state days and days of rest.
Rest days are often related to religious parties or to important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the electivators can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have in total eleven feeds marked in red.
March 15 is a national feat, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as is October 23, also the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is the feast of work and on November 1 and 2, we remember our family members and deceased friends.
Also, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
On the days of our state, national or religious feasts rarely falling on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the fete marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a particular regulation on the replacement days of the days preceding or following the feasts.
The law extends to all employers and employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service societies, institutions that turn uninterrupted and in service, because of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year’s feeds: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to the experiences the majority of people do extra hours or takes a vacation that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year’s Day at home.
Next year a lot of feats fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be fewer changes in workdays compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work floor to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a work day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the fetes because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly set off the collegues
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or we take up the challenge and we consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called a marketing department,” one colleague told you.
That you missed a date?
At best he’s sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them he forgot to get the message across (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but she disappeared the next morning?
You find your pen you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be angry with you for stinging their property.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be nice that there's no more and you need them right away.
You're chatting about the private life of the colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Do not tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury within you the information shared and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues also know.
You're declaring yourself sick without just a reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a heartbreaking pain because you feel bad or you feel you need rest that day, think that your work, your urgent affairs, your missions at the end must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't worry about your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to work or something can happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to tell your boss and colleagues to avoid that they're surprised that you're gone the next day.
Hooping, sneering, telephone
You immerse yourself in your work but the sneering of your colleagues is pulling you out of it suddenly?
You became, unintentionally, witnessing a phone conversation that you better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with hummings, slings, discussions aloud voice (which you lead above their head), footbeats, dirty words or discontents expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
You blame others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send a letter or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetfulness!
Do not blame it on the possible chaos in the office or your loud colleagues!
Recognize it if you made a mistake and if it presented inconvenience to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, repair negligence!
You feel too much at home in the office?
Putting on a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're not interesting anymore
We move slowly in the usual morning traffic.
All of a sudden, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm going up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir comes to join like a real jewel.
Mr2 is releasing Zagar's song Wings of Love.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug is getting different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are not long in the beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in Yonderboi's group before he embarked on his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in a same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dancing music and pop, began to make themselves known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The band playing early in small clubs began to be known by a wider audience when the wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble undoubtedly became "trendy" but no one asked them if they would carry this label.
The band reacted properly, it released a new and better record.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the past years at Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are well there with the reference to flying but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the first of the album at the Millennial Park.
On the album, there is a real hit for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to night, began introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine so (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit pushes me to ask a question: has your music remained music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aiming for a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; non-mainstream or underground, non-alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The music supposedly alternative, underground can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and become commercial.
A good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude works in this spirit also regardless of language or boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
La, people go to concerts and not only young people in their twenties but also the oldest.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Are you interested to know who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously happy to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
We have never made music for the market.
For us music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts where mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you will no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Will you follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made career rather west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in each other’s musical presence and let them unfold.
At first, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi because many of us are leaving his band and taking another path.
hvg.hu: On the palmares of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists of the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the choir with six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This track already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that something was still missing from this song.
The sequel of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang at night even the melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost right away and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the back plan.
There is no solo (except for a brief Judy Jay solo), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scene too.
Is it wanted?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back plan is only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let that these wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none about the music creation process, we had more difficult tracks during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything came together like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already "let go" this record.
These are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader has risked billions because of its inferiority complex
A concealer fraudster.
Thus its former employee is the French giant the Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, can in no way be considered incapable.
Unlike all major bankhouses, it recognized the US mortgage market crisis in time.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, who denounced him to the police.
However, if we stick to the deposition of Kerviel reported by the French media, including Le Monde, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis is beyond the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, are causing problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet it well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I won my first half billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel says and adds that he has, of course, kept nothing to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to having distorted the reports so as not to be screened.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Is he afraid of being discovered?
Rather not.
"I felt that just getting 1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does his desire to risk so big come from?
He has only gradually reached his position.
He had started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already a trader assistant and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
He knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he achieved his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he won half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this stock during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
This is where the coup at the beginning of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to cover the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his holidays.
"Last year, I only took 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another, "concluded Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kroner) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be for the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that Czech Parliament can obtain under these projects.
This money will be at the origin of an increase in the budget of the National Fund of Transport Infrastructure which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
Until now, Czech Rep. was one of the new members of the beneficiaries of the least successful EU funds.
The Tribunal upheld the 20-year prison sentence for Nicaragua's former president
Nicaragua’s Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former country president Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a US$100 million fraud (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, he was later released and was living under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be imprisoned again for the moment, according to the AP agency, not clear.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will depend now on the prison officers, or they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or go to prison again.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictional companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of that money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
We've adopted the budget
That's it.
The State budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford his refusal.
Unlike the agitated debate before the vote of the declaration of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed without any problems this law, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
Here's some kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why we give him more attention in the media.
The disputes of politicians are much more of interest to the opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not able to solve both:
The first being the large share granted to the mandate fees imposed by the law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, in dizzy, bonds, disproportionately indebted their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In previous years, they managed to repay these debts by the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this souch.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has already been going through a phase of growth for several years, as do the rest of the world, and ČSSD is sure to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
In place of this, they were indebted to the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that essentially falls back on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, at the global level, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the election, has been eliminated if a gap in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and anyone in power will only administer.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes ordinary costs be pushed back by mandate costs.
The 70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dispelled all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and grant this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what it manages to levy taxes and tax rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed in the money markets through auctions.
It will be a question for banks to sell, through an auction system, interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction 40 billion dollars and, in addition, it will provide 24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided on action at this point, aimed at preventing or even diminishing the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” writes Bernard Baumohl, a consultant firm’s report, Bernard Baumohl.
“Concervened action by central banks has diminished the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost US$60 billion because of unrepaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more losses in billions.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they must really understand what can still ensue,” says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“I hear the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after the failure to bring down the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English central banks have repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further cut in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ approach will not help ward off the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: Environmental debates are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to harm developing countries mostly.
President Václav Klaus has again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time came down on the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of the environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which is a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, shave solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often only encounter the caricature of my opinions."
Now, interested people can read his positions without them being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, in his view, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts carried out to influence the evolution of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose inverted opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driver's license on time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driver's licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities are on the way to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will take the road.
According to the authorities, have not renewed their driver's license especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There's a queue about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the delivery within five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers of vehicles who are unable to complete the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and will take the road without a valid licence, will face a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also treat the offence by using an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine climbs to 2500 crowns.
According to former information, was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to circulate.
In doing so, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
According to him, the driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like the identity card that must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Simply bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driver's licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driver's licenses.
Persons with documents from the years 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of the detectives passed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of colluding with the gang of David Berdych, will do thirteen and ten years in prison respectively.
The Superior Court of Prague thus definitively sentenced them by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were facing sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment pronounced today, only an appeal to the Superior Tribunal is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is waiting for the verdict of first instance for the moment.
However, he has already received in other trials sentences whose sum exceeds 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty for participation in 19-person hold-ups, the Superior Tribunal was now dealing with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused had questioned the prosecution since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted to criminals information from police sources, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang handed 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Koňařík.
In the prosecution, there is talk of gang criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Mainly armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered a serious attack on health, but also the abuse of power of a public official and prohibited weapons.
During the house searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser fire or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has been enriched by tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other Berdych hand-robbeds and a whole series of other people.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has so far avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are currently living in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer of the victims of the victims Igor Veleba wants to obtain from the hospital of Třebíč a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál does not agree with the proposal of Veleba.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very very high," Dostál said at the end of the hearing.
"To be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report commissioned by the opposing party.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands,” said Dostál.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded a million crowns for each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the negotiations of compensation.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were prone to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was best endured by men, although they were confronted with the remorse of not having been able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in front of what is happening precisely at the moment, summarized the content of the report Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola with the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika with Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed over, at the end of October, to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the hospital of Třebíč managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are forced by law to provide civil liability insurance.
In case of non-compliance, they must draw on the bottom of the reserve, exceptionally, they can ask the manager for help.
Until now, the courts have recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated from the tables were of the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko) brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed he who had used for the first time the title King of Valašsko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš agrees.
"There is a job of almost ten years behind us.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used for the first time the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
However, at the time, it had nothing to do with the plan to set up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of making Valašské Království's passports appear.
From a humorous action he emerged from it a business and a lucrative business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and he even offered the holders sales on the price of the visit of his farm and his theatre shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manéž program, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the project Valašské království," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and her team, which was intensively dedicated to the project.
The collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka a Harabiš, which culminated in the deposition "of King Boleslav I elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, a request that the court today reject.
What could clear up the matter is the tournament considered for the throne and half of the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn’t want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register, "added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
In fact, I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the shift, the driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many ways, be described as below average.
However, currently there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which is much better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes one step further, I only have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained for example about the space for the head on the back seats.
While there the complaints are over because the combi body means that even the great devils will, in this respect, be comfortable.
Let's go see it quickly
I will talk very quickly about the inside so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about seats or backrests that are too short is over.
The lateral guidance has also improved markedly compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also sensitive.
The cubi also sees the lack of space above the head already mentioned disappear.
A safe in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage hold.
I have to evaluate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy tie-up.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, the latter makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is in relation to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we see that the Peugeot remains very substantially behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to bring out the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the backrests of the backrests were perfectly straight, or a very low footstoop.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The automobile we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pipe clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, one must be aware that one has tested a fairly well equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-litre Otto engine is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
However, we have arranged in addition to airbags head, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle ultimately costs 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia the extra equipment and you will get a very similar number.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not going well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, raising concerns among the remaining concerns about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of northern Kent, where the conflicts between the remaining and immigrant of Slovak origin are beginning to be accentuated, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the chicane and the fights between the students have transposed into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who was hitting a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him with rasist remarks.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant carried out by two teenage girls.
The girls had allegedly addressed this man racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we were coming home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," said another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining people went so far as to qualify the conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the original inhabitants and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your holidays can come true if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and the all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Greater West Indies.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depot and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected in the very early 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who had him built, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, were circulating on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of showbusiness and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today then?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigouli and the once imported fiats have already for a long time, in a climate so salty and humid, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decrepit, nowhere else in the surrounding area there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended into the sweets on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see in motion small locomotives whose contemporarys are not elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct your steps?
Most visitors are not missing the best known places.
So there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Viňales in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exhuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile earth having caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is where the best quality Cuban tobacco is probably grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and that of sugar that have brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth has been embodied in the beauty and character of this small city city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí téměř noseměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a far-reaching place that still in the 50' years of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay aside.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't tear anything down either, everyone was content to have a roof over his head.
If one has, in Trinidad, more time than an afternoon, then it is worth also going to see interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of the Sucreries.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes alive after sunset and where the music only becomes deafen in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead there since Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern pitfall of Cuba, thanks to its unspoiled landscape, on the World Heritage List.
We make the best chocolate, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo stand, we see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
As they say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, say the Americans
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
Defence Minister Robert Gates said NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission to Afghanistan does not go as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing protest on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week called through Defense Minister Robert Gates NATO troops for greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to data from the U.S. military, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the period to come, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop today made similar remarks.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the three-day Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The last few months have also reigned conflicts between the countries involved in the issue if all the allies actually do everything possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
“The Afghan lazy people discovered: the Germans are playing, while ours are fighting,” Sun wrote in a document completed with photos of German soldiers playing at the table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild switched to counterattack by posting a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kroner is the responsibility of each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow this year 159.2 billion crowns.
Thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget, the ministry has reduced the expected sum to 152.8 billion crowns.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, from June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the debt of the state dating from early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 kronor is the responsibility of each Czech.
Throughout the past year, the state has been in debt with more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit expected for next year, we could cross the border by only a trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "One could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that the policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is mainly generated by the cumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury bills, annuity securities, direct loans or, for example, by borrowing from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has increased this year by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the state has increased this year for the moment from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The debt of the state called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt requirement of the state was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased internanually from the first to the third quarter by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be room for negotiation when the pension reform comes, "said the data Pikora.
Better than what we expected
It follows from the strategy of financing and managing the debt of the State for the year 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget, the ministry has reduced the expected sum to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially the deficit of the state budget which will clearly reach 76 billion crowns this year, in place of the 91.3 billion crowns initially planned.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources provided for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state annuity securities for 43 billion kronor and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion kroner.
She was now appearing before a court in Khartoum for appointing a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The Briton was accused of having left students from 6 to 7 years old to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a penalty of lashes.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with violating Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself bore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” he said, he said, was only an “innocent mistake.”
A review shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very caring towards her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class."
Recall that the name Mohamed is also the most given middle name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is of course a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“There is no immediate provision for violence, but we are entering a very difficult time,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The troika mediators, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo one last time on Monday.
The future of the province with 90 percent of Albanian speakers could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko deliver their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the Troika was tasked with further mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo to the Security Council, insist on a continuation of negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's UN administration, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,” said the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden where these “last-chance negotiations” were taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that Belgrade’s autonomy plan “belongs to a past that has led to murder and deportations.”
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says in particular that it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990's.
“For Serbia, it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say”
“Only one solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.”
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanian speakers would be “in consultation” with the West.
Bush pulls out an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference held Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “road map” for peace they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the deadline for implementing his "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli states" that coexist at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment to this effect from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in Middle East history, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-language daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of miscellaneous fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating Sunday, shortly after 17 hours, rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a beacon,” a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawazaki, "not approved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road" (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated "at a very high pace".
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” said a police officer.
The blood alcohol control on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before high, star-shaved windshield, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "acts of manslaughter and non-assistance to person in danger" at the IGPN, co-seized with the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the feet-holders on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police quickly left the scene, not lending help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious misconduct” regarding this point.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which you have to be very careful,” a police source said.
Liberation met with an eyewitness of those moments following the accident.
One of his windows overlooking the scene.
“We immediately went down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them,” says the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely haggard policeman, who was liming.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young people had, the police were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the departure of the police.”
They also performed cardiac massages, in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These kids were rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them, "said the prosecutor.
Tension is rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since General Musharraf was set up a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency measures were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stone throwing, wounding policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several were arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court Bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The movement of lawyers on Monday garnered the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who voted against the state of emergency and rubbish to those who were sworn in before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exceptional measure proclaimed Saturday night.
She was to vote in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential election, on October 6, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Musharraf’s promise to leave the army’s leadership and become a civilian president “doesn’t hold out more” after the state of emergency was introduced, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
That he abandon his military uniform was expected by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was placed under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly occurring births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly occurring births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates INED.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed a better "control of fertility", according to the institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Or even calculated to the nearest month for one in five couples and if possible in spring, season judged to be the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, which is essential to the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools "tinkered" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose Tuesday as the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical part tasked with hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of drawing dock for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel electricity production module weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, in order to set it up to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the solar panels of the module which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, unfolding like accordions, was damaged on nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to perform a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, and then go and repair another solar panel whose rotational system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracolel at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of NASA's best spacewalker.
Large, resistant, very clever, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor by training was therefore in charge of "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the attack cable and installed kinds of "splints" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second spacewalker left near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-channel wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "tinkered" by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the shuttle Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS stock sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS share is currently down on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its 2007 operating income forecast following delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is conditioning the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros including more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these expenses, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further detailed details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operating result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly because of expenses related to the delays of another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is now sending a television message to voters on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does it as the head of the united Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything show by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and want honest, most transparent and open elections, elections without snags,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the account.
She denounces a campaign marred by pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Ziuganov says there was "never such dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin."
After the crackdown on last weekend's protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains denied a visit, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus”
Behind these legislative elections without suspense are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
No successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party that would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in both the legislative and the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny,” said sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90's, "Putin has returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population especially since this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," believes Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "renounce voluntarily the personal responsibility" they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 90's.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: “What’s the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? »
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only searchable for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say, individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States being completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research “including on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these personal documents, because of the sensitivity of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
Yet, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers last April gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th largest trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will boost both economies enormously" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential"Han Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England acknowledges concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was anxious to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected inflow of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of an open market operation at five weeks,” she said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time that the BoE has put liquidity on the market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done at a week.
The BoE said in a statement that it is "ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England had a significant penalty rate that had discouraged banks from using it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Center groups on Thursday declined to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Registered in a socialist "niche" (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the 50% increase of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the regulation of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours from the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his group will represent all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about C3 Presents creating a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honour to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to be held from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the world’s most respected festival producers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Calling Glastonbury “the most inspiring event” he ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s company are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We chose Philadelphia as our market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” said Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we got bogged down in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we’re getting ready to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours takes place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a impression of a country festival to the European and urban American.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but affirms "that they are interesting enough to allow to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's capacity is "very large", like that of 80 000 people from the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when going to press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” Jones said.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when no one other than Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the delegated functions.
A mandate — “politically difficult” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the “runaway productions.”
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the “Governator”?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best,” he said.
The Race to Festivals
For the moment, however, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
He will be from all the festivals on the West Side, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, showcase them and ensure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year experts are not as sure as it will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are in the markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum in the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is feeding on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock market will behave rather laterally, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary pressures"
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert said.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Not all experts have this negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution festival (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, evaluates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information that comes from the European Union with regard to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that they will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get involved.
“ACS for several months has been recovering positions and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only on two occasions in December has been a bearish month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the piercing of the technological bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds computer on its year-end rally.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20h30, and to open on Saturday from 10h to 20h30.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Banque Populaire will be decisive for other organizations to adhere or not to this initiative which coincides with the schedules of the shops.
This is precisely the objective that the Banque Populaire is seeking.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to shop in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches located throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of those already existing.
To this end, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank's sales manager, Ángel Rivera, says this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three Madrid branches.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Gran Vía streets of Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and successfully apparently, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
“We do not want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of rival Antena 3
We got there.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegated adviser to Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: “what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have lowered less,” he said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a progression of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66 % over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4.488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yielded 1.52% yesterday and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of other publicly traded communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, as Giuseppe Tringali, the managing advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising, said.
For this data to be real, the television channel would have to record for the current fiscal year an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to the 965.4 million of the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net billing of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the important payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit between its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
“We have the official compromise of giving a minimum of 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33 per cent of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the expected revenue growth of 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered Antenne's earnings forecast of 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on November 1
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congressional vote amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the year ends.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members of Parliament and senators to negotiate and make the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies to ensure that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consulting services to both specialized social reasons and to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and internationalization systems of orders, which compete with the current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose information on key aspects of its business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management on the market and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the NVC.
Through the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that highlights that tenured debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has demonstrated with what has happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management took the opportunity to legally delineate the functions that graduates in Economics may have 30 years after 1977, the royal decree, which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend his services of marketing of products and attract new clients to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increased by five tenths in November, to 4.1 %
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to incorporate it in the calculation of the rate of inflation in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication complies with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to that produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available for publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential about monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged in comparison to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he amassed some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that is gradually dropped in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its advertising gun campaign in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin's Association's offer, which includes three other companies, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested for an alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption fabric discovered this week.
ADe plus, one of the secretaries of the city council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May me Juan Morales, current deputy of the right, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the "leader" of this plot.
Officers continue to search municipal and Urban Planning Council premises and the possibility of further stops is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption fabric, discovered at the beginning of this semine, was imputed.
As stated yesterday by the SER Channel to the lawyer of the deputy 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession relating to the frame.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a company builder of the Galicia to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general election.
Thus the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group which will preside over the Congress if the Socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who the latter made public on November 15 his decision not to stand for election in the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in academia.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, even though the citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not insult or cry" and make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems miserably that the only Madrid office where we can't talk quietly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he already held his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents could consider "domination".
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change subjects to unmercy persecution both the skeptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are the leaders of the non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what steps he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to do, what economic consequences will it have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequences.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that does not speak, that does not denounce and that does not require, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and which does not claim that we travel by bicycle or we cool down with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the Town Hall and a suspicious hotel contractor for possible urban crimes, informed the sources of the investigation today.
The councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to City Hall, where at the moment many agents gathered, who also presented themselves to the Function of Urban Councillor and the municipal enterprise for the management of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial inquiry, which the No. 1 Court of Totana hears.
The first six detainees have now moved to a judicial provision.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was imputed, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is the responsibility of the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operating Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was therefore arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which may have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian commune of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been reclassified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are responsible for real estate development; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a store of cds for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and make it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (an article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of contracts would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less'.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when the two people were guessing that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I do not know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte for eight years has been relentlessly pursuing the Balkan war criminals from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with a bitter taste, because the main culprits of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims have died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'the list of Carla' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who is chasing the criminals on the run and putting pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
There is that, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is reflected in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or used, including.
Insurance companies make their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating.
It is for this reason that people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate due to their caution.
Similarly, by using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many of the variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver must study the situation to choose the car insurance that best adapts to his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various drawbacks when entering into a contract with insurance at an affordable price, as can be the low experience in driving and seniority of the driver's license.
While the ideal way to be well insured is insurance at all risks, other more economical options exist.
The most predictive drivers can opt for any deductible risk insurance, so that they get coverage from insurance at all risks but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europa, online insurance mediator in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage to third parties, but for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
Advice.
If you are a 25-year-old minor, try to be careful and avoid claims where possible, since it will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and the profit of it.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses, "says Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers when making a contract with insurance, since the claim rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is therefore better to choose insurance any risk with deductible.
"Normally young people cannot benefit from the experience gained beforehand after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Child marriages are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest loss rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be insurance at all risks with deductible (possibly of 300 euros), or an insurance with an extended third party from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have more casual driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises,” Noguera said.
For retirees, insurance at all risks with deductible is preferable (by being this one of 150 euros), or an insurance to extended third party when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible claims, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is fundamental to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will look to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measuring themselves next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, since it is used by the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify.
The Italians have ten points and they have already qualified in the fifth day with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC must play in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on 13 of this month looking for a place for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although both teams will try to emerge victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would remain first and ensure a better cross in the eighth finals.
A loss of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but she will not only be able to computer on this since with nine points the game goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who are hopeful to finish for the eighth finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the overtime (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, in case Celtic lose, to finish for the eighth finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls initiated in Vancouver, Canada, ahead of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band dissolved in 2000.
' Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before they began their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the group that was all the rage at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had given them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the public filling the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "has not seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' who left the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed its nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have worked out and we are getting a lot of appreciation."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last exhibited in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, a babysitter army was waiting for them.
They have five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on December 23.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is sounding the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas ferments between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by pipelines, and each pipe is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two, had caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s property monopoly company supplying the gas, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would rise as expected, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from the neighbor Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would include for Ukraine, a 40 percent increase in import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas transits,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
“Fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to the fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest stockpiles of gas, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve the checks to be carried out on its extra-community employees to verify whether they have previous criminals, the control committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
M. Black further expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of people overseas it employs.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, properly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-Community staff following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after rushing with his jeep to the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as he was suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permit for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on previous criminals, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Supervisory Office of previous criminal acts, thus allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"While we have discovered that some information about staff has been verified, it is not done every time," the report said.
M. Black said that the Scottish Department of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but it also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on some overseas staff is available for health services.
M. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the current pre-employment checks, are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring any added value."
Scottish health authorities have reported employing 1161 people overseas, mostly made up of doctors and nurses.
But the general reviser stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, in part because of the problems related to the identification of staff members with open-ended contracts, who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the health authorities' current control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and pre-employment control system for staff members overseas in the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport. »
It added that the Scottish Government allied to the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would undertake to ensure a better execution of recently updated pre-employment checks, and valid for all employees, including persons overseas.

The 50th anniversary director, having shot films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice. »
“I was admiring to this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells planning an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergymen and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, headed by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement from the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell run by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have plotted the killing of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has asked the clergymen to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join the Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied with the United States, considered heretical according to the hard line of the Saudi Sunnys.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by appeals against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces during the last five months," the spokesman for the Minister of the Interior on state television said.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought,” the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists yesterday said that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live in.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had Earth-like conditions, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with a slower rotation, has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the spacecraft of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offers a sad vision of Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are starting to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from Earth’s, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface. »
Enriched uranium sequested by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people have been arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it is uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task as a presidential candidate to answer a snowman's questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions, are submitting them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that of another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, a candidate in the next election.
We don’t know what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest approaching a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The board picked up increases in approval when the candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and M. Romney, who is leading the important early election in Iowa and New Hampshire.
M. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote an "amnesia" (offering illegal immigrants regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to deepen this topic.
None of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they have started to fight immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, allied with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears about the external world, favors Republicans to forget, or to minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
M. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for gun control.
John McCain and M. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the content of the Bible in its entirety.
This has driven Mr. Giuliani dared to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, was not expected to be seen, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, declare that the death penalty is painful although necessary.
When it was insisted whether Jesus would have been in favor, he started laughing and said that Jesus is too chic to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
The rise of M. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday’s debate.
These two are emerging from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protected of the party can not agree to decide who is the best known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly thanks to a message of success on American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills of politicians, no extra conjugal foot finger sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gone well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister backtracked in his election plan, stupidly insulting British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to M. Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the edge of crack, has demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for changing the tax code have provoked a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities, revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions in military spending: they proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his ex-chief of vigilance) have made them have had to resign.
None of this means that M. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can get to a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts behind when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot make a difference, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; ministers' offices take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is getting defensive and without any more objective.
In a sense, M.'s position. Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he can not boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr.'s decisions. Brown taken when he was Chancellor of the British Treasure.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s funds “cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr. is facing. Brown is not as tragic as she seems.
The blunders are not so monstrous as the members of the Torian Party make him believe.
Like in M. Bean, there's no casualties or scams.
And the remedy, while painful, could be to make Mr.’s Stalinist tendencies a reality. Brown always in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
M. Abrahams, a very particular figure, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his benevolence.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subsidizers of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
M. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr.'s programs. Abrahams, without knowing that this was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the collection of subsidies who had spoken of the doubtful donations in October.
But so far M. Brown is not involved: There is no reason to believe that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative loophole, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, to use a committee of inquiry on the subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
There are many other things than Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the Independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, with no leader for six months, and prepare good reform on the financials of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to give up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the election; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to achieve victory is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see stir-finned fins, swirl around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fee and insolvency rates, which measures non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It is too early to panic.
Costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the 3.89 percent insolvency rate in the third quarter is almost one percentage point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States, concerning personal bankruptcy, caused a sharp fall in the bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash rather than the value of wealth, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; therefore, credit card debt would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter the limits of redit.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of having a rapid resumption of action.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market are driving America into recession, the industry will certainly face a gruesome future.
Pay attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron.
The three British bankers who were to testify their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the previous chief financial officer of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous all over Britain because of the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges inflicted on them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron partner, which was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already knew its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the subsidiary's bank for £1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest in this company.
According to the accuse, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers got $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, previously the seventh largest national company, which went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in market value loss and more than $2 billion in loss for pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former general president Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were unsuccessful because of her death from a heart attack last year.
Not under or out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
“Even if no one really needs so many seats since it is more of a family-used aircraft or for the president of a company.”
M. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer incentive orgy that is held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to spark interest from the new Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
M. Firer was voting for a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed next to its booth.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890’s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 70’s, the Japanese in the 90’s, the Russians emerge as the world’s biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealthy are made up of 103000 Russian millionaires that are overall $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the center of economic and financial research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of London’s Davis Morris Jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Melle Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems above all to aim for the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the traffic jams to come to a huge warehouse where are exhibited Cadillac Escalades, platinum dyes, Mövenpick ice creams, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal factory stand for the manufacture of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall-mounted painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
“It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling”
Indeed, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already gone from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not sell at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, either millionaires, millionaires or tourists, survey the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said it sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant Porsche orange, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said it would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” said Mr. Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in property prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has erected four stalls representing the British telephone booths, filled with mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested to throw masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire,” said Mr. Karyev.
Unaccredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was Thanksgiving day when Ronald Livingston looked through the bay window of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and was watching an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized that someone had passed away.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon, which police have not yet identified, reside at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of the death of Ms. Arroyo, but they are waiting confident, the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately will take time, but which should help solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Miss Arroyo was the assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy said about Miss Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday. »
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
M. McCarthy said Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Bevels Control Board, and that she leaves two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County prosecutor's office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died because of unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider. »
“The investigation continues. »
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3pm.
and found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared deceased.
Just over a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation or even the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro where a faded rose rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and again when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut rates related to the effervescence of the world stock market.
Stocks are blown up on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by soothing statements by the US central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their stocks in the turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence has “in part reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
In case this harsh turbulence persists, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial tumult have been accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, investment bank, announcing that it will fire 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of the mortgages.
Only 20 positions are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55% concluding at 13,289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% concluding at 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted following the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorting funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject additional funds into London’s financial markets, causing credit pressures, have caused British banks to raise monthly sort borrowing rates “Libor” by UK banks, causing their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since 12 November.
England face a call for judgment over criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We face two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President and CEO of England, begins to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part time.
Whoever does not manage to win the number 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get over the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not only cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it right about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"; both, new executives having obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only one place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a crickeer unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also in the opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricker must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the day's cricker.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison was in top form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class gates out of 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at the Asgiriya stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could wipe out or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and this, despite the fact that his double one hundred scored against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In Shah’s favor, his brilliant and considerable start at the innings of the 88-in-Bombay Test, 32 cents first-class against six for Bopara, who at 22 years old is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten rounds in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again in form, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joie de vivre.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently collapsed on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from afar, to ask him if "he had seen this? »
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting pace allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it is the real art of selection?
I would be willing to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be he who will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring these exiles without money or visa renewals, or still others who hope that the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight against the activists who have taken them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus carried in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdas,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now. »
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to walk away for the time being.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, helped drive Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni tribe and Shia who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he prompted citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys. »
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have attracted the growing lull of the capital since U.S. troops arrived, and the view of continued formation of well-armed “groups of citizens involved” and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraquians have fled in past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exiled visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return home.
More than two and a half million people are reported to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” said pensioner Sunni.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of the areas of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will increase sectarian tensions again and bring back the fighting.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest state leads to vocational training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher education.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Saor’s, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest state federated, by self-deprecation, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar Formation System, which is placed fifth in the training instructor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high quota of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Saar also leads the children of the country to higher than average numbers - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
“In the Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system,” says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their title of study in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining professional and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, the number of graduates in engineering has, however, declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Saarland has forced higher education schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
“After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced in the whole federated state of the comparison tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of creash is royalty-free - a pattern that in the meantime other federated states also copy.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show whether student performance improves sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the amount of at-risk students decreased by 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Saarland, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could earn points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the sarog is not French.
Chávez sets the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon tick out otherwise than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour chronometer in the South American country.
Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, because of a new law, the watches will be settled at least four and a half hours from universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, because of a case of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t, already just because of my dignity,” said Chávez, who hastens a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw the negotiating mandate in Chávez over the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly "spit in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ringtone is all the rage in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you keep quiet) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry by the constant arrests of the left-wing populists and who told him to remain silent.
A drop in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a prognosis, a real loss of salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease on their pay slip in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the low development of wages, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the newspaper "Bild".
New charges could also be paid in the area of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected reduction in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency is no longer entitled to be spoiled for asking the Federation for appropriations or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was known Tuesday that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the rate of inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus is more like Earth than previously believed: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now provided evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus bursts at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, the lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
That’s not the case on Venus: “If there was a lifetime, it must have been on a very old date in history,” Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution told Washington.
There should be little living things today on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which resembles Earth so much in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no probes were on their way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research findings that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first glance.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the already known wind vortices at the north pole, a whirlwind of clouds at the south pole, which spins much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the drafts in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly on itself: one Venusian day lasts for 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets have formed under similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has attached itself to Earth as carbonate, it is the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the party's quarrel over the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and summons the grand coalition to close the quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
Meanwhile, Köhler showed understanding for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s welcome of the Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should keep a significant balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional politics of One China.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his discontent with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the "staffing policy" of the CDU in terms of foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government has not only decommissioned the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the Spiegel, also froze the so-called dialogue of strategy of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
The head of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama’s reception was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, said Wen Jiabao the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also encompasses other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fighting with the police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades that burn, breakers who shoot the police with shotguns: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive is not also formed in our country and defuses into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to get by with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federated States and the communes were already working firmly to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows his first successes."
But it would be too early for an end of the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian settlements, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government, this is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasises that the quota for unemployed among young people under the age of 25 with an immigrant background would be above average.
Above all, more places to training should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young people from immigrant backgrounds do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged, “But we still have to be careful.”
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with floodlights.
The authorities in office reported three arrests as well as a few burned cars and trash cans.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On the night of Tuesday, nearly 80 policemen were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the troubles overflowed Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives Sunday.
According to the initial elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom – and that there’s nothing left to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live exactly?
After his distressing speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The criticism of focusing too much on politics has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, it made visible to all how accurate this complaint was.
There was no concrete interest or feelings for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a searching politician, who flees into foreign policy and even there stays in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate targets will have to be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise of oneself - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now she is clinging to ready-made formulas, which growth would affect people.
By this it destroys its image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
She has a few accessory phrases left for this.
In this regard, the number of times it makes slips when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-specific sentence.
It staggers in uncharted territory, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack branch
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney engage in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an underdog candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already erupting on the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "safe haven for the illegals", criticizes Mitt Romney for his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, said he was heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants," Giuliani replied and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are up to the attack: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come to power,” McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also taught the lesson vigorously by Vietnam veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room of St. John's. Petersburg in Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are denied, applause breaks out in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie again.
“I made a mistake at that time,” Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for having been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani passes into a sliding knot when asked his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian clothes.
A day after his withdrawal as chief of the armies, Pakistani man of power Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army end.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had passed on his office as chief of the armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus bent over international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as chief of civil status.
With this withdrawal from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf occupied after the establishment of a state of emergency with legal officers of its ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are back.
The supergroups of Germany of the seventies replay: the three members of the band Harmonia have again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, recordings of their great hit "Live 1974" were released.
Already at that time, they were much more well known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has their own little box in front of them, their cable and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left of 57-year-old Michael Rother and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes it is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again has ensured a few emotions among the fans of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, admittedly, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way so that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why would not the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Prize to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw in the room the German pop faces interrogating.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the amazement had no limits.
Later, during the shows, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in oneself and transfiguration in the unknown is the one and only.
Memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed two years and that during this period, the impact power that was felt was much lower than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubleshooted in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians into exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, on an ancient farmhouse in the Weser, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
So-called was in the trash can a flag of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not for himself alone in search of himself.
The CD "Live 1974" which has just appeared was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone thinks they remember.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since more successfully than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set himself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the paperback book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be surrounded with regard to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase hangs in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of cable tools in bazaar are used for the formation of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to draw instruments from the unheard of sounds thanks to instruments with effects built yourself.
Electronic music today is similar to electronic music.
The three in great technical fignoers.
To this even the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It never was rock.
The roots have been less sought after in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also no longer allows himself to be irritated by this now.
But what goes most of itself will be covered thoroughly on the scene.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can hit the nerves of someone (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Lethal Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But the two do not convince.
Either the projects are based too much on the action and on the exchange of senseless fire or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had lastly lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many nice and futile roles in women's sentiment movies and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to still watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why must today's films be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of winks: in the end, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Deadly Peace", which is also released this week, the endless sequel to failed films about the Balkan War.
From "Lethal Peace" the trial can be quickly made: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovo freeshooters, in which one of the two still falls quickly in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are for once not presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a TV movie is lost far too quickly in the action and exchanges of senseless fire.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why deep down there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the high criminal of war "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another moment a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages that NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be referred to the Crime against Cinematic Logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to drive hunting in a rather intensive way because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem of Brecht comes to our mind.
The one speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be evil."
Movies like “The Hunting Party” have exactly that slum heads, but that imply how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been a good film about South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis hotbed or on a minefield, there is then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits to go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or ""Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood can make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List."
Some films still have to mature - those that are worth today classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know today also simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this thrills the writers for the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not being" or "The dictator" actually became so good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good films.
Perhaps we must have the sarcastic and distanced artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only due to the fact that certain things never change."
"Big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is reaping criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The Mayor's step back with Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with virulent criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to keep fighting for the Waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of opportunities.
The chief director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described a abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sports momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz urges the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for it in the longer term, "which takes another modified agenda as a starting point."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg who decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, about Munich's bid for the 2018 winter games.
This preference means for us that, in the time we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, by burying the projects already now," said Wednesday the President of the HSB Günter Ploß.
A abandonment of the candidacy would be in addition to the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in full assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust reportedly called Hamburg’s bid for the 2015 Universiades as “not a substitute” for the Hamburg Olympics.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor’s SPD faction blamed the Senate for not using this valuable time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Petit Grasbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympiads and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Petit Grasbrook a plan integrated into the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
These are not the crates of Warhols.
The one that connects the concepts Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of Warhol’s works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes of the year by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the museum Pontus Hulten made a gift in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large number of theArt.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden crates, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been directly delivered from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce a few wooden boxes Brillo in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time today speak of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Wahrol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached more than 100 000 dollars in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly claimed, later, that about one hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have ceded to him.
In truth, the 105 crates of Hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three others of Swedish private collections, among which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies that date from the year 1990 reveals on the contrary that the paint was directly applied without a layer of background on the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - in addition it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies.
Already in July the Authentication Board has of course announced, that it will investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of cases of soap powder.
But since then we have been surrounded there by an inexorable silence.
Manila rebel soldiers abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers are abandoning, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the government had shortly before stormed the hotel with the help of tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched for hours in the building.
About half of them were standing in court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 – among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly slip away with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who normally had to watch them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' action.
“People have had enough,” said Trillanes.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the elite unit of the Scouts Rangers, said that other units of the army soon wanted to join the march.
Critics of the regime called for a large demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by corruption blames.
The financial district of Manila was already since 2003 the scene of the mutiny attempt of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The insurrection broke nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have already been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent from the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had already speculated on a buyout before.
The option would remain open to further increase stake in Versatel.
With this step we are looking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, said United Internet.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint-stock company MSP to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the moment, the two companies want to feel satisfied with their ten percent stake at Freenet, and not to make use of their right to endorse 18.49 percent more at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies, however, would allow themselves all the open options, especially to increase the stake in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
Poker is still difficult to predict on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile-bound customers and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions at the end of the third quarter.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch previously held a direct interest in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
