It's a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman Natalia Rybczynski.
She is a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up old dead stuff.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, sometimes I was called "Dr. Dead Things."
Latif Nasser: I think she's interesting because of where she works, well above the Arctic Circle in the isolated tundra of Canada.
One summer day in 2006, she was at an excavation site called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude from the magnetic north pole.
NR: Frankly it doesn't sound exciting, because it was a day of walking with a backpack, a GPS and a notebook, and we collected everything that could be a fossil.
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.
NR: Rusty, rust-red, as big as the palm of my hand.
It was just sitting on the floor.
LN: And at first, she thought it was just a splinter, like the ones found at Fyles Leaf Bed before—bits of prehistoric plants.
But that evening, back at the camp, ...
NR:... I take out a magnifying glass, I take a closer look at it and I realize that it does not have the growth rings of a tree.
It may be its conservation, but it really looks like...
a bone.
LN: So over the next four years, she went back to this place many times, and eventually she collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them very small.
NR: It's not that much. It fits in a small plastic bag.
LN: And she tried to put them together like a jigsaw puzzle.
But it was exciting.
NR: It's all broken into so many small pieces, I try with sand and putty, but in vain.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN: Ooh! NR: Yes, exactly.
LN: But it was easier to do it virtually.
NR: It's kind of magical when it all comes together.
LN: How did you know that it was good, that they were put together properly?
Would it have been possible to assemble them differently to have a budgie or something else?
NR: Uh, no. No, it could only be that.
LN: She discovered that what she had was a shin, a leg bone, and specifically, the bone to a forked hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't be one of those.
It was just too big.
NR: The size of this thing was huge. It is a very large animal.
LN: So what animal could it be?
At the impasse, she showed one of the fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
NR: We took a saw, and we just made a notch on the edge, and there was this very interesting smell coming out of it.
LN: It smelled like scorched flesh.
It was a smell that Natalia recognized after cutting out quite a few skulls in her disgusting anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives our bones their structure.
And in general, after so many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted as a natural freezer and retained it.
Then, a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, was introducing a new method called "collagen fingerprinting."
It turns out that all species have slightly different collagen structures, so if you have the collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to that of known species, and, who knows, maybe they match.
So she sent him one of the fragments, by FedEx.
NR: Yes, we wanted to follow him. It was pretty important
LN: He studied it, and compared it to 37 known species of modern mammals.
And he found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5-million-year-old bone that Natalia unearthed from the High Arctic belonged to...
a camel.
NR: And I thought, "That's great -- if that's true."
LN: They tested several fragments and they had the same result each time.
However, based on the size of the bone they found, this camel appeared to be 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would have been almost 2.80 meters, and weighed nearly a ton.
And yes.
Natalia had found a giant Arctic camel.
Well, when you hear the word "camel," what should come to mind is one of those, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.
But you may have in mind a postcard image like this, the dromedary, the typical desert animal -- which lives in the sand of hot places, like the Middle East or the Sahara, with a big bump on its back where it stores water for its meharées, and with big, wide feet that help it climb sand dunes.
So how do we explain that one of them ended up in the High Arctic?
In fact, scientists have known for a long time, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels were originally American.
They started here.
For 40 of the 45 million years since camels have existed, they could only be found in North America, about 20 different species, maybe more.
If we aligned them all, would we see any differences?
NR: Yes, the bodies will have different sizes.
You're going to have some with very long necks, which will actually be like giraffes.
LN: Some had mouths, like crocodiles.
NR: The most primitive ones would have been very small, almost like rabbits.
LN: What? Camels the size of rabbits?
NR: The oldest.
So you probably wouldn't recognize them.
LN: Damn it, I want a rabbit-camel.
NR: I know, that would be great.
LN: And three to seven million years ago, a branch of camels descended to South America, where they became the llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed the Bering tongue of land into Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.
So scientists already knew all this, but it doesn't really explain why Natalia found one so far north.
Because, in terms of temperature, it is exactly the opposite of the Sahara.
To be honest, 3 and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22°C warmer than today.
So there would have been a boreal forest, more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, they would have had winters that lasted 6 months during which the ponds were frozen.
There would have been blizzards.
There would have been 24-hour days completely plunged into darkness.
So, how... How?
How is it possible that one of these superstars of the Sahara can survive in this arctic environment?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And that's pretty great.
What if the characteristics that make the camel adapt so well to places like the Sahara had actually evolved to help it endure winter?
What if these wide feet were made, not to walk on sand, but in the snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
What if this hump -- which, by the way, big news for me, contains no water, but fat -- was there to help the camel endure those six-month winters, when food is scarce?
And then, only later, after crossing the land bridge he used these features to adapt them to the burning deserts?
For example, the hump can be useful to camels for desert climates because having all their fat in one place, like a backpack of fat, means that they do not have this insulating layer on the rest of the body.
So the heat dissipates more easily.
It is this crazy idea, that the attributes of the camel that prove, in our opinion, its desert nature may in fact be proof of its past in the Arctic.
So I'm not the first to tell this story.
Some have spoken of it to embellish evolutionary biology or to provide insight into the future of climate change.
But I love it for any other reason.
For me, it's a story about us, how we see the world and how it's changing.
I have a degree in history.
And I learned that actually a lot of scientists are also historians.
They make sense of the past.
They tell the story of our universe, our planet, life on it.
And as a historian, you start with a certain idea of how history unfolds.
NR: We make stories and that's it, like the camel in the desert.
It's a great story! It fits the idea well.
They apparently always lived there.
LN: But at any time, you can discover a tiny piece of evidence.
We can learn a little trick that will force us to review everything we thought we knew.
For example, in this case, there is a scientist who finds this sparkle thinking it is a piece of wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and really counterintuitive theory that shows why this creature, seeming to come out of Dr. Seuss's drawings, is the way it is.
And for me, it completely changed the way I see the camel.
He went from being this ridiculous creature only adapted to a specific environment, to this great traveler who has just arrived in the Sahara, and who could theoretically arrive anywhere.
This is Azuri.
Azuri, hi, how are you?
Ok, hold on, I've got this for you.
Azuri is on vacation, usually at his concerts at Radio City Music Hall.
It's not even a joke.
In short -- Azuri is here as living proof, to remind us that the history of our world is dynamic.
Only our will can help us to readjust it, to reinvent it.
Isn't it, Azure?
And really, we are all at a bone of seeing the world differently.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so amazing that you don't realize how bad they are.
Today I'd like to talk to you about this problem and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First, I'd like to take you back to Harlem on a freezing night in 2011 that left a deep impression on me.
I was sitting at a bar not far from Columbia University, where I was studying computer science and neuroscience, and I was having a big conversation with another student about the ability of holograms to one day replace computers.
As we arrived at the best moment of the conversation, of course, his phone turns on.
He pulls it out, looks at it and starts typing something.
Then he forces his eyes back on me and he says, "Go on. I'm listening. »
But of course, his eyes were absent, and the moment had passed.
Meanwhile, in this bar, I saw another student holding his phone, this time towards a group.
He was scrolling through photos on Instagram, and these kids were laughing hysterically.
This dichotomy between my feeling of unease and the joy they felt about the same technology made me wonder.
The more I thought about it, the more I realized that here, the problem was clearly not the digital information, it was only the position of use that separated me from my friend and brought these kids together.
They were connected around something just like our ancestors who improved their social knowledge by telling stories around the campfire.
I think that's exactly what the tools should do.
Extend our bodies.
I think computers today do the opposite.
Whether you're emailing your wife, composing a symphony, or comforting a friend, you do it pretty much the same way.
You're leaning over those rectangles, tapping buttons, menus, and more rectangles.
I think that's the wrong way. I think we can start using a more natural machine.
We should use machines that bring our work back to this world.
Machines that use the principles of neuroscience to prolong our senses, not go against them.
It turns out that I actually have such a machine.
It's called Meta 2.
Let's test it!
In front of me, I can see an audience, and I can see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we will see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appears in front of me, from the glasses I wear.
Of course, it could be something we buy or learn, and I can use my hands to move them finely.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll come back to that a little later.
Now if you're like me, your mind is already in shock at the possibilities we have with this type of technology, let's look at some of them.
My mother is an architect, naturally the first thing I imagined was to draw a building in 3D instead of using these plans in 2D.
There, she touches graphics and selects an interior decor.
Everything was filmed with a GoPro with our own glasses.
This next case is really special to me, it is Professor Adam Gazzaley's brain glasses project, provided by UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I will always fantasize about the possibility of learning and memorizing these complex brain structures with a real machine, I could touch and play with these different brain structures.
What you're seeing now is called augmented reality, but to me, it's part of a much bigger story — a story about how we start expanding our bodies through digital objects, rather than the other way around.
Now...
I think that in the coming years, humanity will experience a change.
We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world.
Imagine for a moment what that would mean for storytellers, painters, neurosurgeons, interior decorators and perhaps for all of us here today.
And what we need to do as a community is try and make the effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that expands the human experience, rather than gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information.
That's what I'm really passionate about.
Now I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years — it's not the smallest device — in about five years, they'll all look like strips of glass over our eyes projecting holograms.
As a neuroscientist, you don't care about the phone you buy for its technical characteristics — you buy it for the operating system, I've always dreamed of creating the "iOS of the mind," if you will.
It's very, very important to get it right, because we could live in these things for at least as long as the time spent with the Windows UI.
And I don't know about you, but living inside Windows scares me.
To isolate the most intuitive interface from infinity, we use neuroscience to create our design principles, rather than a bunch of designers arguing in meetings.
The principle we all rely on is what is called the "Neural Path of Lowest Resistance."
Each time, we try to connect the iOS of our brain with our brain according to, for the very first time, our conditions.
In other words, we are trying to create a computer without a learning curve.
We build a system that you have always known how to use.
This is the first of three principles we employ in this brand new user experience.
In the first place, you are the operating system.
Classic file systems are complex and abstract, requiring your brain to take extra steps to decode.
We would thwart the Neural Path of Lowest Resistance.
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you put your TED holographic panel right there, and your holographic email on the other side of the desktop, and your evolved spatial memory retrieves them.
You could put your holographic Tesla you buy — or any model my legal team told me to put on.
Perfect. Your brain knows exactly how to bring it back.
We call the second interface principle "Touch to See".
What do babies do when they see something that attracts attention?
They try to reach him, to touch him.
This is exactly how the natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system has an essential boost of a sense called proprioception — this is the sense of our body's limbs in space.
By directly affecting our work, we will not only better control it, but we will also understand it better.
And so, touch to see.
But that's not enough to feel things.
We are inherently social primates.
This brings me to our third principle, the holographic campfire of our first story.
Our mirror neural system suggests that we can better connect with each other and with our work if we can see our faces and hands in 3D.
So if you watch the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around that object, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's keep going and try again with neuroscience in mind.
Again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
I will now go further and grab this pair of glasses and leave it here next to the office.
I am with you, right now we are connected.
My spatial memory has turned on, and I can grab it and put it back here, remembering that I am the operating system.
And my proprioception is on, and I can go on and blow up these glasses into thousands of pieces and touch the sensor that's scanning my hand.
But that's not enough to see the objects alone, in a second, co-founder Ray will phone in 3D -- Ray?
Hi Ray, how's it going?
I can see this person entirely in front of me in 3D.
And it's pretty realistic.
Thank you.
My mirror neuron system suggests that this will replace phones in a short time.
Ray, how's it going?
Ray: All right. We are live today.
MG: Ray, give the audience a gift from the holographic brain we saw earlier.
This will not only replace phones, but it will also change the way we collaborate.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Ray.
Ray: Nothing.
MG: Well, here's the message I discovered in a bar in 2011: the future of computers is not stuck inside one of these screens.
It's right there, in us.
If there is only one idea I can give today, it is that the natural machine is not the fruit of the future, it is just here in 2016.
That's why all of us at Meta, including administrative staff, executives, designers, engineers -- before TED2017, we're all going to throw away our external monitors and replace them with really and profoundly more natural machines.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, that's very kind.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: Well, explain one thing to me, because there were few demonstrations of augmented reality last year or previously here.
And there is sometimes a debate among technologists about whether we really see the real object on the screen.
It is a field of view problem. In a way, the technology shows a wider view than you should see when wearing the glasses.
Have we seen real life?
MG: Absolutely real life.
And not only that, we took other steps to film with a GoPro with the real lenses, the different videos broadcast.
We want to try to simulate the experience of the world we see through glasses, and not cut any passages.
CA: Thank you very much for that introduction.
MG: Thank you very much, it was a pleasure.
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States: Seattle, Washington.
I grew up with a family of great Seattelites.
My mother was an artist, my father a university professor, and I am grateful for my childhood, because I have always been completely comfortable living my life as I saw fit.
In fact, I took a path that was not what my parents had imagined.
At 19, I dropped out of college -- dropping out, firing, splitting hairs.
I went on tour as a professional horn player, which was my lifelong dream.
I played chamber music throughout the United States and Europe, I was 2 years on tour with a great jazz player: Charlie Bird.
Approaching my 30th birthday, I ended up a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a life!
My parents never complained.
They supported me throughout.
It was not their dream.
They would tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son is taking a sabbatical decade."
And -- There was, however, an embarrassing conversation about my lifestyle that I would like to tell you about.
I was 27 years old, I had come back from Barcelona, I was at my parents' house for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
She said, "Your father and I are worried about you."
I said, "What?" What could it be?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest: Did you vote Republican?"
Actually, I wasn't very political, I was just a horn player.
I had an epiphany, they had perceived it and it was causing confusion.
I had become an enthusiast of capitalism and I want to explain to you what it is.
It grew out of my lifelong interest in, believe it or not, poverty.
When I was a kid, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower-middle-class family, but, of course, this is not real poverty.
It is even far from it.
The first time I saw poverty and its face, I was 6 or 7 years old, in the early 70s.
And, as with many of you, it was a prosaic and mundane example.
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child my age in East Africa, there were flies on his face and a distended belly.
He wasn't going to make it, I knew it and I was helpless.
Some of you remember this picture, not exactly this one, but a similar one.
It revealed the abject misery to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, dropped out, did something else, and started a family.
And I wondered what had happened to this child.
or others like him all over the world.
I studied, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for an answer: what was happening to the poorest people in the world?
Was it getting worse, was it getting better? What?
I found the answer and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe poverty has gotten worse since our childhood since they saw this photo.
Ask Americans how global poverty has evolved, 70% will say that world hunger has worsened since the early 70s.
But here's the truth.
This is the epiphany that changed my way of thinking.
Between the 70s and today, the percentage of the world's population living in famine, living on less than a dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, this percentage has dropped by 80%.
There has been an 80% decrease in the most severe global poverty since I was a child.
And I didn't even know it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We need to celebrate that.
This is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in human history, and it is happening in our lifetime.
When I heard this, I asked: what did this, made this possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to do it again and lift the next two billion out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a child, two billion of those, our brothers and sisters, have been lifted out of poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I need to know why.
I looked for an answer.
It wasn't political, because I didn't care.
I still don't care.
I wanted the best response from traditional economists on the left, right and center.
There she is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons why two billion of our siblings have been lifted out of poverty since I was a child.
The first: globalization.
The second: free trade.
The third: economic rights.
The fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: entrepreneurship.
It was the system of free enterprise spreading around the world after 1970 that did this.
I am not naïve.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect and that free enterprise is not enough to build a better world.
But she's great.
And it goes beyond politics.
Here's what I learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
Its main asset is aspiration, which is what many people talk about on this stage, aspiration that comes from dreams embedded in the system of free enterprise.
We need to share it with more people.
I want to talk to you about a second epiphany that is linked to the first and that can bring us progress, not only in the world but also at home.
The best quote I've heard to sum up the thoughts I've just evoked to lift people out of poverty is this: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They have lifted billions of people out of poverty. »
Who said that?
It looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
It's not true.
President Barack Obama said it.
Why do I know her by heart?
For he was addressing me.
That's crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah!"
But, more than that, I said, "What an opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
I was at an event on this topic at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought that was the solution to America's biggest problem today. What is it?
It is to come together around these ideas, liberal and conservative, to help those who need it most.
Needless to say, we are in crisis, in America and in many politically polarized countries around the world.
It has reached a critical crisis level.
It's unpleasant. It's not fair.
Last year, there was an article in the Procedures of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
It was a 2014 article about the asymmetry of political motivations.
What is it? Psychologists call this the phenomenon of the presumption that your ideology is based on love but that your opponent's ideology is based on hatred.
This is common in a global conflict.
You expect, for example, to see it between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article discovered is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from asymmetry of political motivations.
Today, a majority of politically active people believe they are motivated by love but that the other party is motivated by hate.
Think. Think.
Most people say, "My ideology is based on a fundamental benevolence, I want to help people, but others are demonic and want to hurt me."
Society cannot progress when there is this kind of asymmetry.
That's impossible.
How to solve this?
First, let's be honest: there are differences.
Let us not minimize the differences. That would be naïve.
There is a lot of research on this.
A veteran of the TED scene is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He works on the ideology, values and morals of different people to see their differences.
He showed us, for example, that the Conservatives and the Liberals have a different emphasis than what they think is important.
For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care 59% more about poverty than they do about economic freedom.
And conservatives care 28% more about economic freedom than they do about poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We will never come together. False.
It is in diversity that our strength lies.
Remember what lifted us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading throughout the world.
We need others, in other words, if we want to help people and lift the next two billion out of poverty.
There is no other solution.
How are we going to do it?
It's tricky.
We need to innovate in the way we think.
Many points are on stage.
Social entrepreneurship. Yes. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
A flexible ideology,
less predictable.
No?
Do you ever feel like your ideology is becoming predictable?
Almost conventional?
Don't you feel like you're always listening to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the right, the Conservatives, you always talk about taxes, regulations, a big government.
And on the left, liberals, you always talk about income inequality.
These are important things, very important to me and to you.
But when it comes to helping people who are starving and need us, these are distractions.
We need to come together around the best ways to alleviate poverty using the best tools at our disposal, and that only comes when the Conservatives recognize that they need the Liberals and their obsession with poverty, and the Liberals recognize the Conservatives need the free market.
It is in this diversity that lies the future strength of this country, if we choose it.
How are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I need an action plan, not just for you but for me.
Number one. First point: it is not enough to tolerate people who disagree.
It is not enough.
Let us remember that we need people who disagree, because there are people who need all of us, who are always waiting for these tools.
What are you going to do? How will you express it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
In this room, we are all lucky.
Lucky to have people listening.
Lucky to thrive. Lucky to lead.
When people hear us, with the unpredictable ideology, they may listen.
Perhaps progress will begin there.
That is the first point. The second.
Deuzio: I ask you and I wonder to be specifically the person who blurs the line, who is ambiguous, difficult to classify.
If you are a conservative, be a conservative who always talks about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets, used responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do that, we get two things.
One: we are starting to work for the next billions and to be the solution we have seen in the past and need in the future. We get that.
And the second thing is that we might be able to take the terrible ideological war we are suffering in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then maybe, perhaps, we will realize that our great differences are ultimately not so great.
Thank you.
In university, I majored in Political Science so I had to write a lot of essays.
When a normal student writes an essay, he spreads out the work much like that.
You know... You may start slowly, but you write a little during the first week and associated with more productive days, in the end, everything is done and everyone keeps calm.
And I'd like to do it like that.
That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But the essay comes and then I do that.
And that's how it is for every essay.
Then came my 90-page final year thesis, a document you're supposed to be working on for a year.
I knew that for such an essay, my usual pace was not sustainable.
So I planned everything, and I decided I had to come up with something like this.
The year was going to go like this.
So I was going to start light, and I was going to increase in the middle months, and at the end, I was going to put the gear up, like a little staircase.
Climbing stairs, where is the difficulty?
That's not much, is it?
But then, a funny thing happened.
Those first few months?
They came and went and I couldn't really work.
So we have a great revised plan.
So what... But then those middle months came and I didn't really write a word, so we were here.
Then two months turn into one month, which turns into two weeks.
And one day I wake up three days before the deadline, still not having written a word. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans are not made to spend two sleepless nights. I ran across campus, dove in slow motion, and gave the essay just before the deadline.
I thought that was the end of it.
But a week later, I got a phone call from the university.
And they say, "Tim Urban?"
And I said, "Yes."
"We need to talk about your thesis."
"OK."
And they say, "This is the best we've ever seen."
It's not true.
That was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy that unique moment when you all thought, "This guy is fantastic!"
No, she was very, very bad.
Today, I'm writing a blog.
I write the blog Wait But Why.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always baffled the non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what's going on in our heads, why we're the way we are.
I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators are actually different from other people's brains.
To test this, I found a lab with MRI that allowed me to scan my brain and that of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them.
I brought them here to show you today.
I want you to look carefully to identify a difference.
I know if you're not brain experts, it's not so obvious, but give it a try.
So that's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Right now...
This is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decision Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
This means that everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decision Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn't like this plan, so he gets behind the wheel and says, "Actually, let's go read the whole Wikipedia page on the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that."
Therefore... So we go to the fridge to see if there is anything new in the last 10 minutes.
After that, we embark on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman on magnets and ends much later with interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
"It's all going to take time so we're not going to have time to work today. Sorry! »
What's going on here?
The Monkey doesn't seem to be someone you want behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he is only interested in two things: ease and fun.
In the animal world, it works properly.
If you're a dog and you spend your life doing only easy and fun things, you're fantastic!
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You need to sleep, eat and create a new generation. This could work in prehistoric times.
But if you haven't noticed, we don't live in prehistoric times.
We live in an advanced civilization and the Monkey does not know what it is.
That's why we have another person in our brain, the Rational Decision Maker who gives us the ability to do things that no other animal can do.
We can project ourselves into the future.
We can get an overview of the situation.
We can make long-term plans.
And he wants to take all that into account.
And he wants us to do just what makes sense, here and now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying some well-deserved free time.
There is overlap. Sometimes they agree.
But on other occasions, it makes much more sense to do things that are more difficult and less enjoyable, for the sake of the bigger picture.
A conflict is then created.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to end the same way every time, leaving him to spend a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place, totally outside the Circle of Logic.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators know very well.
This is the place where we have free time activities at times when they shouldn't be happening.
The fun you have on the Dark Playground is actually no fun, because it's undeserved and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing, all those feelings of good procrastinator.
In this situation, with the Monkey at the wheel, the question is: how can the procrastinator get here in the blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where the really important things are done?
It turns out that the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who always watches over him in his worst moments. Someone was calling the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time but wakes up abruptly whenever a deadline gets too close or there is a danger of public embarrassment, career disaster or any other terrible consequence.
And most importantly, this is the only thing the Monkey is afraid of.
It became very relevant in my life very recently, when the TED folks contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a presentation.
Of course, I said yes.
It has always been my dream to have given a presentation for TED.
Past tense: But in the midst of this excitement, the Rational Decision Maker seemed to have something else in mind.
He said, "Do you understand what you have accepted?
Do you understand what will happen now?
We need to sit down and work on that now. »
And the Monkey said: "Totally agree but let's open Google Earth and look at southern India, like 50 m above the ground, and scroll the map for 2h30, until we reach the north of the country, in order to better understand India. "
That's what we did that day.
As six months turn into four, then two and one month the TED people decided to publish the names of the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face looking at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster begins to lose his mind, and a few seconds later, there is anarchy throughout the system.
And the Monkey, remember, he is terrified of the Boom Panic Monster, here he is at the top of the tree!
And finally, the Rational Decision Maker can get behind the wheel and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains a lot of the rather insane behavior of the procrastinator, such as how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to start a sentence of an essay and miraculously find the amazing work ethic to stay up all night to write 8 pages.
This whole situation, with these three characters, is the procrastinator system.
It's not pretty, but in the end it works.
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did, I was amazed at the answers.
Thousands of emails came in, from all over the world, from all kinds of people, doing all sorts of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many PhD students.
They were all writing the same thing: "I have this problem too."
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of those emails.
These people wrote with intense frustration about what procrastination had done with their lives, about what the Monkey had done to them.
I thought about it and said: if the procrastinator system works, what's the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastination.
The examples I have given today all have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved.
But there is a second type that happens in situations without deadlines.
If you want a career as a freelancer, something in the arts or entrepreneurship, at first there is no deadline for these things because nothing happens, before you start the hard work to gain momentum to get things moving forward. Lots of important things
Outside of your career don't have deadlines, such as your family, your health, exercising, working on your romantic relationship or getting out of it when it doesn't work.
If the only mechanism of the procrastinator to do difficult things is the Panic Monster, it is a problem because in all these situations without deadline, he is not there, he has no reason to wake up. The effects of procrastination are not contained and spread ad infinitum.
It's this type of long-term procrastination that's much less visible and talked about much less than the more fun, short-term, time-based procrastination.
It is often suffered in silence and in private.
It can be a source of enormous sorrow and regret.
That's why these people were sending me these emails and why they felt so bad.
It's not that they were messing around on certain projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes made them spectators of their own lives.
The frustration isn't that they can't achieve their dreams, it's that they can't even make the first move.
So I read those emails and I had a kind of enlightenment: I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
It's true. I think you're all procrastinators.
You may not all be in a bad state like some of us... ... And some here may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the Monkey's biggest trap happens when deadlines don't exist.
I want to show you one more thing.
I call it the Calendar of Life.
One box for each week for a life of 90 years.
It doesn't represent that many boxes, especially when you've already used a lot of them.
I think we should all look closely at this timetable.
We need to think about what we procrastinate on because everyone procrastinates on something in their lives.
We must remain aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
It's a job for all of us.
There aren't that many boxes, so it's a job that should probably start today.
In fact, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
Thank you.
There we were, souls and bodies crammed into a Texas church, on the last night of our lives.
Crammed into a room just like this, but with old wooden benches draped in worn red cloth, an organ to my left and a choir behind me, the baptismal font embedded in the wall behind it.
A piece like this, nevertheless.
With the same tremendous sense of suspense, the same deep hopes of salvation, the same sweat in their palms, and the same people deep down who don't listen.
It was December 31, 1999, the night of Christ's Second Coming, and the end of the world as I knew it.
I had turned 12 that year, and I had reached the age of responsibility.
After I stopped complaining about the injustice of Jesus' return when I was to be held accountable for my actions, I realized that it was better for me to clean up quickly.
I went to church as often as I could.
I watched for silence with the anxiety of someone watching for the noise, trying to make sure the Lord hadn't played a trick on me and decided to come back early.
And in case He came back sooner, I had anticipated a backup plan, reading the series of "Left Behind" which was a hit at the time.
I found in their pages that if I wasn't taken away at midnight, I had another chance.
I just had to avoid taking the mark of the beast, fighting demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.
It would be difficult — but I knew I could do it.
But now was no longer the time to organize.
It was 11:50 p.m.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar because he wanted to pray when midnight struck.
Each faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir remained in the choir, the deacons and their wives — or the Baptist bourgeoisie, as I like to call them — stood in the front row in front of the altar.
You see, in the United States, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And just behind the Baptist bourgeoisie were the elderly—those men and women whose backs had once bent under the warm sun of the cotton fields of East Texas, whose skins seemed marked with a smooth and noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams about the future of their lives outside East Texas had sometimes been shattered.
deeper than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were for me the stars of the show.
They had been waiting for this moment all their lives, as their medieval predecessors had eagerly awaited the end of the world, and as my grandmother had been waiting for the Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8, every day, at 4pm.
And as she walked to the altar, I hid behind her, for I was absolutely certain that my grandmother would go to Heaven.
And I thought that if I shook her hand hard during prayer, I might go with her.
So I held his hand, and closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers became louder.
And the cries in response to the call to prayer rose even higher.
The organ joined the funeral atmosphere.
And the incipient heat joined with the sweat.
My hand tightens his embrace, so as not to be the one abandoned.
I closed my eyes harder, so as not to see the separation of the wheat from the chaff.
Then a voice rose above us: "Amen."
It was over.
I looked at the clock.
It was past midnight.
I looked at the older believers, whose Savior had not come, who were too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to begin to doubt now.
But I was upset for them.
They had been deceived, deceived, bamboozled, and I had let myself embark with them.
I had said their prayers, I had not yielded to temptation as best I could.
I had not dipped my head once, but twice, in this baptismal font that gave the break.
I had believed.
And now what?
I arrived home in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings herald the new millennium as he circled the world.
I was struck by the oddity of Jesus' multiple returns, based on different time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous — hurt, really.
But that night, I couldn't stop believing.
I just began to believe a new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible that the answers were wrong, that the questions themselves were wrong.
Henceforth, where there had been a mountain of certainty, there was, rushing to its base, a source of doubt, a source that promised rivers.
I can trace the origin of the entire drama of my life that night in this church when my Savior did not come for me; When what I really believed turned out, if not a lie, at least, not quite the truth.
Although some have prepared for the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because a part of you has done the same thing I have since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, my father did not return, and my Lord refused to come.
And I reached out, in order to achieve something to believe in.
I stood firm when I arrived at Yale at 18, confident that my trip from Oak Cliff, Texas, was a chance to leave behind all the hardships I had experienced, dreams and broken bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself at home during a winter vacation, face on the ground, hands tied behind my back, and a burglar's gun to my head, I knew that even the best education could not save me.
I held on when I joined Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So hopeful — that I called my family to inform them that we would never be poor again.
But when I saw this temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
I stood my ground when I arrived in Washington, as a young employee, who heard a voice from Illinois saying, "We've waited a long time, but with this election, change has come to the United States."
But when Congress came to a standstill, the country was torn apart, hope and change sounded like a joke, I knew that even the second political coming could not save me.
I had faithfully knelt at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time, gods of success, money, and power.
But again and again, midnight sounded, and I opened my eyes to see the death of all these gods.
From this cemetery, I began to search once more, not out of courage, but because I knew that either I believed or died.
So I made a pilgrimage, again to another Mecca, Harvard Business School — knowing this time that I couldn't just accept the salvation it claimed to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to do.
The work started late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, on the night of an early and miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I wondered what young people in search of authenticity have been wondering for a very long time: "How about we go on the road?"
We didn't know where to go or how to get there, but we knew we had to.
All our lives, we longed, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "sneak into the night and disappear somewhere," and go see what everyone was doing all over the country.
Although other voices said that the risk was too great and the evidence too thin, we still left.
We traveled nearly 13,000 miles across America in the summer of 2013, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, the swamps of New Orleans, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses whose intention defined the goals.
Having been formed at the western end of capitalism, this appeared to us as a revolutionary idea.
And that idea spread, growing into a non-profit organization, MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today.
This idea developed because we discovered that our generation is hungry for purpose, meaning,
because we found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of America, who were creating jobs, changing lives, and needing a little help.
But if I'm honest, it also developed because I fought for it.
I spared no effort to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could heal the wounds of a broken country, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was this gospel journey that led me to this rather different gospel that I have come to share with you today.
This trip began one evening, nearly a year ago, at the Museum of Natural History in New York, during a gala for Harvard Business School alumni.
Under a replica of a life-size whale, I sat with the titans of our time, as they celebrated their peers and good deeds.
There was pride in a room where the value and net worth under management exceeded $500 billion.
We looked at everything we had done, and that was good.
But as luck would have it, two days later, I had to go not far away, to Harlem. I found myself sitting on an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me about the children who came here every day.
They all lived below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their belongings in backpacks to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them participated in Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, in order to receive their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with his retirement money, after 20 years as a taxi driver.
He told me that he was not paying himself because, despite its success, the program was struggling to get resources.
He told me he would accept any help he could get.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of tears coming to my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation that I could sit in a room one night where a few hundred people had $500 billion and in another room two days later, just 5 miles away, where a man lived without pay so that a child had his only meal of the day.
It wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It wasn't the thought of those hungry, homeless children, it wasn't rage toward the 1% or pity toward the 99%.
No, I was upset because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis of a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story replaced all those of those who were expected to take charge of themselves, even if they had nothing to grasp to take charge of themselves; that my organization replaced all the structural, systemic aid that never went to Harlem, or Appalachians or floor -9, that my voice replaced all those voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian, too ill-adapted.
And that shame, that shame came over me, like the shame of sitting in front of the television watching Peter Jennings herald the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been duped, deceived, bamboozled.
But this time, the false Savior was me.
You see, I have come a long way from the altar, the night I thought the world was going to end, from a world where people spoke in tongues, regarded suffering as a necessary act of God, and took a text as an infallible truth.
Yes, I've come so far that I'm right where I started.
Because it's just wrong to say that we live in an age of disbelief — no, we believe today just as much as we did before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We can believe in the bible of the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review.
We can believe deeply when we worship here at TED Church, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our god. We take the text of technological progress as the infallible truth.
And we hardly realize the human price we pay, when we fail to question a brick, lest it destroy all our foundations.
But if you are disturbed by the unacceptable things we have come to accept, then it must be time for a questioning.
I don't have a gospel of disruption or innovation, or a triple line of results.
In fact, I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today.
I have, and offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not require that you stop believing, but that you believe in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible that the answers are wrong, that the questions themselves are wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it begs the question, "Why?"
With all the power we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so much?
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business.
We have fired our team and closed our doors, and we will share our model freely with anyone who grasps the power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt forces me to give up the role of savior that some expect of me, because there is not enough time and our chances are too slim to wait for seconds, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it regenerates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths designed for us seem to lead us to our doom, when our healers do not help our wounds, it will not be our blind faith — no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate a little the darkness of our lives and our world,  and will allow us to make our voices heard to whisper,
or to shout, or to put it simply, very simply, "There must be another way."
Thank you.
The food crisis
is in the news every day.
But what is it?
In some parts of the world, there is too little food, or perhaps too much.
Elsewhere, GMOs save the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Too much agricultural runoff creates toxic oceans, declining food.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly discouraging.
How can we bring this topic back to something we understand?
What does this apple tell us about the food crisis?
You all ate an apple last week, I'm sure.
How old do you think she was when she was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months. That's the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don't think it's much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in cold stores, we gas the warehouses. There is actually documented evidence of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying because the atmosphere to slow the ripening of the apple is toxic to humans.
How come none of you knew?
Why didn't I know?
90% of the quality of this apple, all the antioxidants, are gone when it arrives at us.
In fact, it's just a little ball of sugar.
How do we have so little information and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform.
I know the platforms. I know computers. I was glued to the Internet when I was young.
I did some very strange things... ... on this platform.
But I met people, and I could express myself.
How can we express ourselves in food?
If we had a platform, we might feel able to ask: If only?
I asked myself: What if... Was the climate democratic?
So, here is a map of the climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They are changing, replacing each other, and California farmers are now Mexican.
China is taking land from Brazil to grow better food, and we are slaves to the climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
What difference would it make to the way we live?
What would this change for the quality of life and nutrition?
The problem of the previous generation was to have more food and have it cheaper.
Welcome to your global farm.
We built a huge analog farm.
All these lines are cars, planes, trains and transport.
It is a miracle that we feed seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
And what if...
We were building a digital farm?
A global digital farm.
What if you could take that apple, scan it somehow, send it as particles into the air and piece it together on the other side?
What would happen?
Let's go over a few quotes. They inspire me in what I do.
The first: "Japanese agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land and no future." That's what I found out when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children have gone to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they are already importing 70% of their own food.
But this is not just about Japan.
2% of the U.S. population is involved in agriculture.
What right answer can come from just 2% of the population?
Circumnavigating the world, 50% of the African population is under the age of 18.
80% of them do not want to become farmers.
Agriculture is difficult.
The life of a small agricultural entrepreneur is miserable.
They leave for the city.
In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There are more farmer suicides this year than the previous 10.
It makes you uncomfortable talking about it.
Where are they going?
To the city.
There are no more young people, and everyone is leaving.
So how can we build a platform that would inspire young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine.
A few years ago now, I went to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and Home Depot and started hacking.
I built stupid stuff, made the plants dance, connected them to my computer, and killed them all; I killed a lot of them.
I finally managed to bring them to life.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships of my entire life, because I was learning the language of plants.
I wanted to make it bigger.
I was told, "Indulge yourself, young man!
Here's an old electronics lab that nobody wants.
What can you do? »
My team and I built a farm inside the Media Lab, a place known not for biology, but rather for computer science.
Inside these 6 m², we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month. It's little food.
There are a lot of interesting technologies in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful roots, white, green colors, deep and a monthly harvest.
Is it a new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is it a new grocery store?
I can assure you something: this is the first time someone in the Media Lab has ripped out the roots of anything.
We have salads in bags, there's nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data scientist, a roboticist, pulling out roots and thinking, "I know a little bit about it. I can do it, I want to try. »
In that context, we would grow the plants and bring some of them back to the lab, because if you grow them, you don't throw away, you attach yourself to them.
I have funny taste buds now; I'm afraid to let anyone eat something without having tasted it, because I want it to be good.
I eat lettuce every day and can give its pH to within 0.1.
And I say, "No, its pH is 6.1, you can't eat it today."
This lettuce that day was super sweet.
She was super gentle because the plant was stressed and she had caused a chemical reaction in her to protect herself: "I'm not going to die!"
And plants that do not want to die, seem sweet to me.
Technologists fall backwards in the face of plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to try.
We wanted to see what people can create, we designed a lab that can be shipped anywhere.
Then we built it.
On the front of the Media Lab, there is my lab, which has about 30 detection points per plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, that's the phenome, okay?
Phenomena.
When you say, "I like strawberries from Mexico," you really like strawberries from the climate that has produced the expression you like.
So if you code the climate – this amount of CO2 and this amount of oxygen creates a recipe – you code the expression of this plant, the nutrition of this plant, the size of this plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
We need data, so we've put a bunch of sensors to tell us what's going on.
Think about your houseplants! You're super sad because you're wondering, "Why are you dying? Why don't you talk to me? »
Farmers acquire a unique ability when they pass the 60 or 70 age mark.
They can tell when a plant dies that it is a nitrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency or that it needs more water.
This unique ability is not transmitted.
Here are the omens of the "farmer in the cloud".
We track this data over time.
We correlate them with particular plants.
It's all the broccoli in my lab, by IP address.
Our broccoli can be reached by IP address.
And if that's not weird enough, you click once and get a profile of a plant.
And it gives you the downloadable evolution of this plant, but not in the way you think, not just when it's ready.
When does it reach the nutrition I need?
When does it reach the desired taste?
Is she getting too much water?
Does it get too much sun?
Alerts.
She can talk to me, she dialogues, we have a language.
I think she is the first user of the Facebook of plants!
This is its plant profile and this plant will start to make friends.
I think so: it will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn more about a complexity we could only assume.
Maybe they won't become our friends, maybe they will, it will depend on us.
This is my laboratory.
It's a little more organized, my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I'm familiar with creating controlled environments.
And so, within this environment, we experience all sorts of things.
This aeroponic process was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent into space.
This process gives the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not so complicated. When you give them that, you get an amazing result.
It's as if the plant has two hearts.
And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We have moved forward in technology and seeds for an unfavorable world and we will continue to do so, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world.
We grew all sorts of things.
These tomatoes had not been produced and sold for 150 years.
Did you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks?
Seed banks.
It's unbelievable.
They have genetic material, things you've never eaten.
I am the only person in this room who has eaten this kind of tomato.
It is a tomato for sauce that we do not know how to cook. We ate this tomato. And it wasn't great.
We did things with protein, all kinds of things.
We grew humans. Maybe you would, but we didn't.
What we've achieved is... that the tool was too big, and too expensive.
I was starting to distribute it around the world and it cost about $100,000.
Finding someone with 100,000 in their pocket is not easy, so we tried to make it smaller.
It was the project of one of my undergraduate mechanical engineering students, Camille.
Camille and I and the whole team, we tried all summer, how to make it cheaper, that it works better, that others can do it.
We dropped them off in schools, from sixth to high school.
And if you want to stay humble, try to teach children.
I went to the school and said, "Set the humidity to 65%."
A middle school student said to me, "What is humidity?"
I said, "Water in the air."
He said, "There's no water in the air, you're an idiot."
And I said, "All right...
Don't trust me.
Set it to 100. »
He puts it at 100 and what happens?
It starts to condense, make fog and, eventually, drops.
And he said, "Oh. Humidity is rain.
Why didn't you tell me? »
We created an interface like that of a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can connect anywhere in the world from their smartphone or tablet.
They have the different parts of the bots, the sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children all over the world.
They select and activate this recipe, they plant a seedling.
While it's growing, they're making changes.
"Why does a plant need CO2?
Is CO2 bad? He kills people! »
Intensify the CO2, the plant dies.
Reduce CO2, the plant is doing very well.
Harvest the plant, You have just created a new digital recipe.
It is a design, an iterative development, and a process of exploration.
They can download all the data about this new plant they developed or the new digital recipe and what it did – was it better or worse?
Think of it as the little hearts of the process.
We will learn so much.
This is one of the food items, as we call them, in a school after three weeks.
That's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time this kid thought he could be a farmer — or that he might want to be a farmer.
We have put everything in open source.
Everything is online; Try building your first food computer.
It's going to be tough - I'm telling you.
We are at the beginning, but it is all there.
It is very important to me that it is easily accessible.
We will continue to move in that direction.
They are farmers, electrical, mechanical and environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners,
on a single platform, doing what they're good at.
But we saw a little too big.
This is my new installation that we just launched.
This warehouse could be everywhere.
That's why I chose it.
And inside this warehouse we're going to build something a little bit like that.
Those already exist.
Look.
These also exist.
One makes it possible to grow green, the other makes it possible to produce the Ebola vaccine.
It's cool that this plant, the big winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for progress on Ebola.
Factories produce the protein that is resistant to Ebola.
From pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, to simple lettuce.
But these two things are nothing alike, and that's where I am in my field.
Everything is different.
We're at that weird stage of, "We're almost there." It's like, "Here's my black box. "No, buy mine."
-- No, no - I have the intellectual property, quite valid.
Don't buy his, buy mine. »
In fact, we are just at the beginning, at a time when society is also changing.
While we are asking for more but cheaper food, we are asking for better food that respects the environment.
When you have a McDonald's ad that explains what's in the McNuggets, the most mysterious food product of all time, on which their marketing campaign is based, everything changes.
From now on,
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers, run on the open phenome.
Think open genome, but we're going to add little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can retrieve, update, and grow.
What does this look like in reality?
Remember the planet connected by lines?
We are starting to have the beacons.
We start sending information about food, rather than sending food.
This is not only my dream, these are the places where we are already deploying.
Food computers, food servers, soon food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food is not about fighting what is wrong.
We know what's wrong.
The future of food is about networking the next billion peasants and empowering them using a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel ashamed to be a European.
Last year, more than a million people in need of our help arrived in Europe and our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, yet more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean since then.
International treaties recognize that refugees are a collective responsibility, yet we accept that little Lebanon hosts more Syrians than all of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of smugglers, yet we make them the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We lack manpower, yet we are preventing people corresponding to our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, yet -- we have policies of repression that arrest minor asylum seekers, separate children from their families, and seize refugees' property.
What do we do?
How did we get here, that we adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's due to a lack of interest, at least I don't want to believe it.
I believe that it is because our politicians do not have a vision, that they do not know how to adapt the international asylum rules, created more than 50 years ago, to globalisation.
I want to step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
Second, how can we fix it?
The current refugee regime was created as a result of the consequences of the Second World War by these people.
Its primary purpose is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its people, people have a place to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can return.
It was created precisely for situations such as the current situation in Syria.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states have committed to reciprocally admit people fleeing conflict and persecution.
But today, this system is failing.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies block the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or return to their country of origin.
But in practice, they remain stuck in eternal limbo.
In theory, refugees are a global shared responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries close to conflict host the overwhelming majority of refugees.
The system is not broken because the rules are bad
But because we are not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that is what we need to reconsider.
I will explain how the current system works.
How does the current refugee regime work?
But not from an institutional perspective, rather from the point of view of a refugee.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira.
For me, Amira represents
A lot of people I met in the area.
Amira, like 25% of the world's refugees, is a woman with children, and she can't go home because she's from this city you see: Homs. A city that was beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira can't go back.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there is a lottery available to only less than 1% of refugees.
Amira and her family face an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is for Amira to take her family to a camp.
In the camp, she could be helped, but there is little future for Amira and her family.
The camps are in austere and arid places, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, at night, you hear the shelling from across the border.
Economic activity is restricted.
Education is often of poor quality.
Worldwide, about 80% of refugees in camps must stay there for at least 5 years.
It's a miserable life, and that's probably why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
An alternative for Amira is to head to the urban area of a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
This is an option chosen by about 75% of Syrian refugees.
But it also has difficulties.
Refugees in such urban areas are often not allowed to work.
They often do not have access to help.
And so when Amira and her family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing left and will be in urban misery.
There is a third possibility that a growing number of Syrians are choosing to choose.
Amira can seek hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and this is what we see today in Europe.
We therefore offer refugees an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban misery or dangerous travel.
For refugees, that choice is today's refugee regime.
But I believe it is a false choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason we limit these options is because we think they are the only options available to refugees, but they are not.
Politicians see this as a zero-sum problem, if we benefit refugees, citizens pay the price.
We tend to think of refugees as an inevitable cost or burden to society.
But they don't have to be. They can contribute.
My point is that there are ways to increase opportunities and everyone benefits: host countries and communities, our societies and refugees.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our view of refugees.
These four views have one thing in common: they include the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and modernize the way we think about refugees.
The first idea is that of enabling environments. It starts with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
My Oxford colleagues and I embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda, not because it is representative of all host countries.
He is exceptional.
Unlike the majority of host countries, Uganda has provided an economic opportunity for refugees.
It gives them the right to work, the freedom to move.
And the results are extraordinary, for the refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we found that 21% of refugees own a business employing people and 40% of these employees are natives of the host country.
In other words, refugees create work for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we have discovered extraordinary examples of dynamic and successful businesses.
For example, in a village called Nakivale, we have the example of Congolese refugees running digital music sharing companies.
We found a Rwandan who runs a business to enable young people to play video games on recycled consoles and televisions.
Despite the difficulties of extreme constraints, refugees innovate and the man you see is a Congolese man named Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived in the camp with very few possessions, but he wanted to become a director.
So, with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, rented a camera and made films.
He has directed two documentaries with and for our team and is building a successful business with almost nothing.
These are the kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we must provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we need to go further.
We must offer the opportunity of connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to banks.
Everything we take for granted, that integrates us into the global economy, can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have the approach that Uganda has.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in this way.
But there are always pragmatic options we can use.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea we had there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy.
It is the idea of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees as well as the employment of natives of the host country.
15 minutes from Zaatari camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is King Hussein Bin Talal's development zone.
The government spent more than $100 million to connect it to the electricity grid and the road network, but two things were missing: access to labour and foreign investment.
so that refugees can work there rather than being stuck in camps, support their families, develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We recognized that Jordan would benefit, as its development strategy required a shift from a middle-income country to an industrial one.
Refugees would benefit but it would also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the war, recognizing that we must incubate refugees because they are the best resource to rebuild Syria.
We published this idea in Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah took up the idea.
This was announced at the London conference on Syria and a test will begin during the summer.
The third idea I want to put to you is the notion of preference between states and refugees leading to positive outcomes that you see in this selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do it and it will be better for everyone.
The economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of market adequacy, where the order of preference of the parties determines their possible correspondence.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym looked for ways to apply this idea to refugees, to ask refugees to rank destinations, but also to allow states to rank the type of refugees they want based on skills or languages, and then match them.
Of course, there should be quotas for diversity and vulnerability, but this is one way to increase the chances of matching.
The idea of matching is successfully used to, for example, distribute students to university, match kidney donors and patients, and the algorithm exists on dating sites.
Why not apply this to offer refugees choice?
It could also be used at the national level where one of the biggest challenges is persuading local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to cities, which makes no sense.
Matching markets make it possible to bring these preferences together and to listen to the needs and demands of the host population and refugees.
The fourth idea I want to talk about is the principle of humanitarian visas.
The tragedies and disorder seen in Europe could have been avoided.
They stem from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy: in order to apply for asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously on a dangerous journey that I have already mentioned.
But why are these trips necessary in the age of low-cost airlines and modern consular means?
These journeys are unnecessary and, last year, they led to the deaths of more than 3,000 people at Europe's borders and on European territory.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that. And we can do this through humanitarian visas that allow people to get a visa from an embassy or consulate in a neighboring country and then pay for their ferry or plane ride to Europe.
It costs around €1,000 to pay a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt costs €200.
If we allowed refugees, it would have major benefits.
This would save lives, reduce the smugglers' market and mark the end of the disorder seen on the front line of Europe in areas such as the Greek islands.
It is the laws that prevent us from doing so, not a rational solution.
It is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil has taken a forward-thinking approach and more than 2,000 Syrians have obtained humanitarian visas, gone to Brazil and, upon arrival, applied for refugee status.
In this configuration, every Syrian who did this was granted refugee status and was recognized as a refugee.
There is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents authorizing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel to Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And Nansen's International Refugee Bureau was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
Each of these four ideas I've presented to you are ways to expand Amira's choices.
These are ways we have to increase refugee choice beyond these options, these three impossible options that I have detailed to you, while benefiting others.
In conclusion, we need a new perspective one that expands refugees' choice but recognizes that they don't have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations and the ability to contribute, if we allow them to.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will still travel, people will be displaced and we must find rational and realistic ways to manage it, not based on the old logics of humanitarian aid, charity, but built on the opportunities offered by globalisation, markets and mobility.
I urge you to wake up and I urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was little, I dreamed of the ocean.
A wild place, very colorful and full of life, home to bizarre and fantastic creatures.
I imagined big sharks reigning supreme and graceful sea turtles twirling through the corals.
First as a marine biologist, then as a photographer, I have spent most of my career looking for places as magical as the ones I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I started exploring the water very early.
But the first time I really went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
I vividly remember making decided flippers to reach this old cannon embedded in a shallow coral reef.
When I was finally able to catch it, I looked up and found myself surrounded by fish of all the colors of the rainbow.
That day, I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Marine Conservation Photographer In 40 years on Earth, I have had the immense privilege of exploring some of the craziest seascapes for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've photographed everything from huge sharks to tiny ones that fit in the palm of my hand.
I felt the fish in the breath of humpback whales feeding next to me in the cold waters of Canada, near the Great Bear Rainforest.
I even knew all about green turtle love rituals in the Mozambique Channel.
We all leave an imprint on the ocean and vice versa.
And the pristine seas I dreamed of as a child are always harder to find.
They are ever smaller and more threatened.
While we humans maintain our role as the largest predator on the planet, I have witnessed direct repercussions and photographed them.
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience with disturbing images to get them out of their indifference.
This approach has its merits, but I have come back from it.
In my opinion, the best way to produce change is to sell love.
If you will, I am a couple maker and, as a photographer, I have the unique opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems beneath the surface of the ocean.
You can't love and fight for something if you don't know it exists.
Revealing this – that's the power of marine photography.
Among the hundreds of underwater locations I've seen, a handful of these landscapes touched me deeply.
I saw the first of these landscapes, about 10 years ago, off the rugged and rugged coast of South Africa.
Every summer, huge schools of sardines move north, a mass migration phenomenon called the Sardine Run.
A mad race of these fish
where hordes of hungry and agile predators chase them.
Common dolphins hunt together and manage to isolate sardines from the main school and create small schools.
They dive and trap the fish upwards, against the surface and rush to enjoy their wriggling feast.
Sharks follow closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks feed more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the small schools created are more sparse and sharks often end up with a "sardine doughnut" or a mouthful of water.
I've had a few lively moments with sharks on the Sardine Run, but I know they don't see me as prey.
I receive blows and am jostled like all the other participants of this brawling banquet.
Let's leave the African coast, to go east, through the vastness of the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the monsoon season, manta rays from all over the archipelago travel to a tiny islet of Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most smaller than a marble, are the staple food of manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, manta rays feed on their own and they do back, looping pirouettes, like a puppy chasing its tail.
As the density of plankton increases, the lines line up in the tail leu leu and form these long chains. Every delicious bite that escapes the first is swallowed by the second or next.
When the concentration of plankton reaches its peak, the manta rays swim ever closer in a rotating motion by which they feed.
As they swirl through this narrow formation, the column of manta rays creates its own vortex, sucking in and bringing plankton straight into the rays' cavernous mouths.
The experience of diving among these countless rays is absolutely unforgettable.
The first time I photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I have worked with NGOs like Manta Trust, and my photos have helped make Hanifaru a marine protected area.
Fishermen from nearby islands hunted these manta rays, they used their skin to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most fervent conservatives and manta rays contribute more than $8 million to the Maldive economy each year.
I always wanted to go back in time and see an era where maps were incomplete or read, "Here dragons."
I came closest to it by visiting these remote atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Far, far away, from boat and fishing lines, diving into these waters is a poignant memory of what our oceans once looked like.
Bassas da India is largely unknown. It is a tiny wedge of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
Its barrier forms a shield that protects its inner lagoon, a nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
Something told me that they would be even bolder and more numerous at night.
I found myself facing more sharks than ever before, gathered on a simple outcrop.
Photographing and sharing moments like these reminds me why I chose this path.
Not long ago, I was working on a project in Baja California for National Geographic.
Halfway, descending along the Pacific coast, is San Ignacio Lagoon, where the gray whale comes to give birth.
For a century, this coast was the scene of a systematic massacre, more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred to survive.
Today, the descendants of these same whales play on the surface with their offspring and they even interact with us.
This species has done remarkably.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have brought them to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to make their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next is a miracle.
In 2005, after only a decade of protection, scientists recorded the largest increase in fish.
But don't take my word for it, come with me.
In a breath, swim into the depths with me in the middle of one of the largest and densest schools of fish I've ever encountered.
We all have the opportunity to inspire hope.
And through my photos, I would like to convey the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And I would particularly like to highlight nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search hard to make photos like this, while creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean that,
I hope, will become the daily life for me.
To thrive and survive doing my job, you really have to be a foolproof optimist.
I always work thinking that the next fabulous image that will serve my purpose is ready, just behind the next reef, in the heart of the next lagoon, or who knows, maybe in the next one.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government was emerging from a long war of independence and immediately announced a socialist program: health services, primary education became essentially free.
A major expansion of rural health centers has placed about 80% of the population within a two-hour walk of one of these centers, a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25% of Zimbabwe's children were fully immunized.
In 1990, a decade later, this proportion was 80%.
I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie was palpable.
Working with brilliant Zimbabweans—scientists, doctors, activists—I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a progressive global movement for public health.
But there were considerable challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first case of AIDS in 1985, the year I arrived.
I had taken care of a few AIDS patients in the early '80s, during my medical training at the hospital in Harlem, but — we had no idea what was in store for Africa.
My first days there, the infection rate was 2%.
It would skyrocket to one in four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later.
In the mid-90s, I told hundreds of prime-age people they had HIV.
I had seen friends and colleagues, my students, patients die in the hospital.
In response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We were demonstrating condom use.
We have launched education in schools, interventions in the workplace.
We were doing research. We gave advice to partners of infected men so that they knew how to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and at the time, I thought I was doing my best.
I provided excellent treatment, as good as possible.
But I wasn't talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan spoke honestly about his personal failure that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the director of the UN Peace Department.
At a memorial 10 years later, he said, "At the time, I thought I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and gather support."
The AIDS epidemic took the health community by surprise, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from the disease, I am not alone in remorse and regret for not having done more, sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as that of an advocate or a politician.
I was there because of my technical skills, clinical skills and epidemiological research.
For me, my job was to take care of patients and do research to better understand transmission patterns in the population, and I hoped we would slow the spread of the virus.
I was aware that marginal populations were at very high risk of having and dying from AIDS.
And on sugar plantations, which closely resembled feudal fiefdoms more than any modern business, 60 percent of pregnant women had HIV.
I worked to show that being infected was not a moral failure but rather linked to a culture of male superiority, forced immigrant labor and colonialism.
Whites were largely spared.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behavior, to use condoms, to reduce the number of partners.
Infection rates were rising. And when a treatment became available in the West, which remained our most powerful weapon against the virus, it was not affordable for the African public sector.
I did not speak out against the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or the underlying economic and political systems that drive up infection rates among large groups of the population.
I rationalized my silence by telling myself that I was just a visitor to this country, that sounding the alarm could get me expelled, prevented me from doing my job, from taking care of my patients, from doing much-needed research.
So I didn't revolt against the government's initial position on AIDS.
I did not express my concerns out loud.
Many doctors and health professionals may think I didn't do anything wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, evokes the inviolability of the patient-doctor relationship.
I did everything I could for every patient I had.
But I knew that epidemics appear along the fissures in our society, reflecting not only our biology, but more notably patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class, etc.
This was true for AIDS.
This was true recently for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, have called this "structural violence." Structural because inequalities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, and are often invisible to privileged people and those in power; and violence because its impact — premature deaths, suffering, disease — is violent.
We do little for our patients if we do not recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and this is how we could gather support to revolutionize and create change together.
Today, I do not remain silent.
I talk about many things, even if they make those who listen to them uncomfortable, even if they make me uncomfortable.
A lot of what I say has to do with racial differences and institutionalized racism, things that are no longer supposed to exist in this country, let alone in medical practice or public health.
But they exist and we pay for them by shortening lives.
That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence faced by people of color, mixed with our sad legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about it is fundamental to the successful completion of my work as New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York City, premature mortality — dying before age 65 — is 50 percent higher for black men than for whites.
In 2012, a black woman was 10 times more likely than a white woman to die in childbirth.
Although we have made tremendous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby is still nearly three times more likely than a white baby to die in its first year.
New York is no exception.
These statistics are compared with statistics made across the United States.
A recent analysis by the New York Times reported that there were
1.5 million black men missing. They cited the fact that more than one in six black men who are now between the ages of 25 and 54 no longer lead a normal life, but were in prison or died prematurely.
There is a great injustice in the face of the daily and disproportionate violence against young black men, which is the focus of the recent #BlackLivesMatter protests.
But we must remember that the disparate rates that persist and the occurrence and outcome of common diseases — heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV — diseases that can kill gently and silently and take even more black lives prematurely.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word "racism" in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students have participated in demonstrations in white coats, but the medical community has mostly stayed away as current discrimination continues to affect disease patterns and mortality.
And I am afraid that the trend of personalized and precise medicine, the search for biological or genetic targets for a more appropriate treatment, could inadvertently make us lose sight of the global situation, that is, the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, a fundamental factor in determining the health of the population:  For too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals, in our daily work, whether in practice or in research, we witness a great injustice: homeless people who are unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities; transgender youth who think about suicide because our society is too rigid; the single mother who is made to feel responsible for the poor state of health of her child.
Our role as healthcare professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and promote change.
Whether by law or not, our position in society makes us very credible and we should not spoil that.
I regret not speaking out in Zimbabwe, and I promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I would use every opportunity I could to sound the alarm and gain support for health equity.
I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you in denouncing sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time to stand up and, as a community, speak out against structural inequalities.
We don't need to have all the answers to call for change.
We just need courage.
The health of our patients, of each and every one of us, depends on it.
A show of hands: How many of you have ever deleted a Facebook friend because he made an offensive remark about politics, religion, parenting, food?
How many of you avoid at least one person just so you don't have to talk to them?
Before, to have a polite conversation, we followed Henry Higgins' advice in "My Fair Lady": stick to the weather and your health.
But these days, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, these topics... are no longer very safe.
The world we live in, this world where any conversation can potentially turn into controversy, where our politicians cannot talk to each other, and where even the most trivial topics have supporters and detractors, this world is not normal.
Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults and found that, right now, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before.
We make fewer compromises, which means we don't listen to each other.
We decide where to live, who to marry and even who will be our friends, based on our already established convictions.
Again, that doesn't mean we don't listen to each other.
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we've lost that balance.
This is partly due to technology.
The laptops you all have, either in your hands or close enough to be able to grab them quickly.
According to Pew Research, about one-third of American teens send more than 100 text messages a day.
Many of them, the majority in fact, will probably text their friends rather than talk to them face-to-face.
There is a great article in "The Atlantic" magazine.
written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students did a communication project.
He wanted to teach them how to talk about a particular topic without notes.
He said, "I realized... »
"I realized that the ability to hold a conversation is perhaps the skill most neglected to teach.
Children spend hours talking and brainstorming through screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to hone their interpersonal communication skills.
It may sound weird, but we have to ask ourselves: in the twenty-first century, what skill is more important than knowing how to have a coherent conversation?
My job is to talk to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people I like and others I don't.
I talk to people with whom I deeply disagree.
But I always have fantastic conversations with them.
For the next 10 minutes, I would like to teach you how to speak and listen.
Many of you have already heard advice on this subject: look people in the eye, think beforehand about interesting topics to discuss, look, nod and smile to show your attention, repeat what you have heard or summarize it.
Forget all that.
It's crap.
There is no reason to learn to demonstrate that you are attentive, if you are indeed attentive.
I use exactly the same skills as a professional interviewer as in my daily life.
So I'm going to teach you how to question people and it's going to help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and most importantly, without offending anyone.
We've all had extraordinary conversations before.
We have had them. We know what it is.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel involved and inspired, or that makes you feel like you've really bonded, or been fully understood.
There's no reason why the majority of our conversations shouldn't be this way.
I have 10 ground rules. I'll explain them to you but honestly, if you take one and master it fully, you'll already have better conversations.
Number 1: No multitasking.
Not just putting down your laptop, tablet or car keys, or whatever you have in hand.
Be present.
Live in the moment.
Don't think about arguing with your boss,
nor what you're going to eat tonight.
If you want to end the conversation, do it, but don't just be half present.
Number 2: Don't teach a lesson.
If you want to give your opinion, without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react or grow, write a blog.
I have a very good reason not to invite critics to my show: they are very boring.
Conservatives will hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
The Liberals will hate the big banks, the oil industry and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You don't want to be like that.
You have to start every conversation, with the idea that you are going to learn something.
Scott Peck, the famous therapist, said that for true listening, you have to erase yourself.
Sometimes it means setting aside your own opinion.
He said that the speaker will feel this acceptance, and become less and less vulnerable and more likely offer the hidden recesses of his mind to the listener.
Consider that you have things to learn.
Bill Nye: "Every person knows something you don't."
I put it this way: every person is an expert in something.
Number 3: Ask open-ended questions.
For that, take inspiration from journalists.
Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
You will answer the most powerful word in this sentence, here "terrified", and the answer will be yes or no.
"Were you angry?" "Yes, very angry."
Let them describe. They are the ones who know.
Ask questions such as, "What was it like?"
"How did you feel?"
Because they might need a moment of reflection and then you will have a much more interesting answer.
Number 4: Go with the flow.
It means that ideas will come to your mind and you have to let them come out of your mind.
We have often heard interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, and then the host takes the floor and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or that has already been answered.
The host probably stopped listening 2 minutes before because he was thinking about his next question, a very smart question he was determined to ask.
We do the same thing.
We're sitting and chatting with someone, and then we remember meeting Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to you.
You have to let them come and then leave.
Number 5: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on radio, especially on NPR, are more aware that what they say is being recorded; They are therefore more cautious when talking about their expertise and what they are sure they know.
Do the same. Fish out of the extra room of caution.
The floor should not be taken lightly.
Number 6: Don't compare your experience to theirs.
If they're talking about the loss of a family member, don't talk about the loss of a family member.
If they talk about the problems they have at work, don't tell them you hate your job.
It's not the same, ever.
Every experience is unique.
Most importantly, it's not about you.
No need to use this moment to prove that you are awesome or how much you have suffered.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking for his IQ, who replied, "No idea. Those who boast about their IQ are dummies. »
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 7: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending and very boring and we tend to do it.
Especially during conversations at work, or with our children, we have a message to pass on so we rephrase it tirelessly.
Don't do it.
Number 8: Save the details.
Frankly, it doesn't matter what years, names, dates and all those details you can't remember.
I don't care. What matters is you.
People are interested in you, in what you have in common.
Forget the details. Leave them out.
Number 9: it's not the last, but it's the most important.
Listen.
I can't tell you how many important people have said that listening is perhaps the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrase, "If your mouth is open, you don't learn."
And Calvin Collidge said, "No one has ever been fired for listening."
Why don't we listen to each other?
First, we prefer to talk.
When I speak, I am in control.
I don't have to hear what I'm not interested in.
I am the center of attention.
I can put forward my identity.
But it's not just that: we get distracted.
We speak an average of 225 words per minute, but can listen to up to 500.
So our minds complete with another 275 words.
I know it takes effort and energy to give your attention to someone, but if you don't, it's not a conversation.
but rather two people shouting barely related sentences in the same place.
You have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey put it very well:
"Many of us don't listen to understand.
We listen to respond. »
One last rule, number 10: be brief.
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt: short enough to hold attention, and long enough to cover the subject. "My sister] It all comes down to a basic concept: take an interest in others.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was a ritual in my house.
People would come and talk to my grandparents and after they left, my mom would come up to us and say, "You know who it was?
She was the finalist of Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He is a Russian ballet dancer. »
So I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and absolutely awesome side.
I think that makes me a better facilitator.
I keep my mouth shut as much as possible, keep an open mind and am always ready to be amazed and never disappointed.
Do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
Thank you.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I won medals in three different sports and national championships in Canada, played basketball at an international level and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train 5 days a week in basketball and speed skating, working with high quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best in my sport.
Besides, I do all this with the Special Olympics.
Does it change the way you perceive me and my successes?
The world doesn't see people like me as champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were on the run and hidden.
Special Olympics have come a long way since the beginning in 1968, but too often people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the general public.
People use the "R" word with me, and they think it's okay.
It is the word "delayed" or "backlog" used in a derogatory way.
They have no idea how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here for charity.
I am here because there is always a big problem with the way many people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, the way they do not see them at all.
Did you know that the World Championships took place this year?
I was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were more than 62,000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and there was TSN and ESPN covering the event.
Did you know that this event took place?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to consider us equals.
Special Olympics transforms the unique identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who don't know, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
Special Olympics are separate from Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality, year-round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities, which changes lives and perceptions.
This movement has changed my life and the lives of so many others.
And it has changed the way the world views people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born epileptic and with an intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12.
The older I got, the harder I felt was to keep up with others, and I became upset and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't play any sports, had no friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they could play sports, let alone be an important member of society.
In the 60s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the fitness of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that led to fitness problems.
Many people doubted that people with developmental disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics, persevered, and Special Olympics athletes proved them right four and a half million times.
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, had little confidence and didn't have many friends.
When I arrived, however, everyone encouraged me a lot, supported me and let me be myself without being judged.
Now I am a basketball player and speed skater who competed at regional, national games, and this year ended up at the World Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I was part of the very first Canadian basketball team to compete at the World Games.
I'm one of more than four and a half million athletes around the world, and I've heard so many similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics athlete brings pride and dignity.
Special Olympics also address important health needs.
Studies have indicated that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport.
In addition, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health.
Special Olympics also provides free screening tests for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing medical care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my Team Canada teammates and I played against Team Nigeria.
The day before our match, the Nigerian basketball team had come to the screening of World Games athletes were distributed free of charge to seven out of ten members and had the opportunity to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was incredible.
They were very excited, happy and confident, because their coaches could communicate orally with them.
And they were very emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the enthusiastic fans in the stands — sounds that we take for granted.
Special Olympics does more than transform athletes in sport.
The Special Olympics transforms their lives off the field.
This year, research showed that nearly half of adults in the U.S. don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
Then there's the "R" word, demonstrating that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a usual term or an insult.
It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it's deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the world.
People don't think it's insulting, but it is.
As fellow athlete and world spokesperson John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who used the "R" word as an insult, "Come join us one day at the Special Olympics.
You will see if you leave with the heart unchanged. »
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours before diving into the final night of weightlifting competition.
It was a sold-out night when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Elk, lifted 297kg and 277kg in squats — setting huge new Special Olympics records.
Jackie is one of the record holders among all weightlifters in Newfoundland — not just at Special Olympics but all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN live-tweeted her new record and was impressed with her performance.
50 years ago, few people imagined mentally disabled people capable of doing something like this.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and applaud athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were applauded and celebrated.
Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now I have dreams and successes in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and pursuing a career as a personal trainer.
I'm no longer hidden, mocked, and I'm here giving a TED talk.
The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still work to be done.
So the next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you see their talent.
The next time someone uses the "R" word next to you, I hope you'll tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope you'll consider getting involved in the Special Olympics.
I would like to leave you with one last thought.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
Special Olympics are changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to trust, meet friends, not be judged and feel and be champions.
Thank you very much.
You probably don't know Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
For me these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
There, in hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists who have calmly fought one of humanity's deadliest threats in years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus resembles the Ebola virus.
It can cause a high fever and can often be fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day, to protect individuals in their communities, and ultimately to protect us all.
One of the most amazing things I learned about them, during one of my first visits, a long time ago, was that they start every morning – those difficult mornings on the front lines – singing.
They come together, and they show their joy and strength.
Over the years, we have visited each other. I could be among them, sing, and write. It was extraordinary, because it reminds us that we are not just here for science, but that we are bound together by a shared humanity.
You can imagine, it is extremely important, even vital, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
It was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was scary... We were all terrified.
We had suspected for some time that the Lassa and Ebola viruses were more prevalent than previously thought, that it could reach Kenema.
So members of my team immediately joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team on the ground. We have set up diagnostics to perform molecular tests capable of detecting the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already managed to control the Lassa virus. We knew how to do it, the team was outstanding.
We just had to give them the tools and the lab for Ebola.
Unfortunately, that day has arrived.
On 23 May 2014, a woman arrived in the maternity ward of the hospital. The team performed molecular testing and identified the first case of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.
It was an exceptional job.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and begin to understand what was going on.
It could have prevented what happened.
But the day it happened, the epidemic had been brewing for several months.
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
It entered Sierra Leone, not as a singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to deal with the cases. The next week there were 31, then 92, then 147 cases, they all came to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could solve this problem.
We worked tirelessly, trying everything we could to help each person, and try to get attention. We also did something else:
we didn't throw away the blood tests, used to detect Ebola, we put them in a chemical to turn them off. We packed them and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We also worked, tirelessly, day after day. We quickly generated 99 Ebola virus genomes.
The genome is the architect's plan of a virus.
We all have one.
It indicates what we are made of, and gives us so much information about ourselves.
The results of this kind of work are simple and very useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, we observed and compared them, and we found that, by comparing them to the three genomes that had been previously published in Guinea, the epidemic had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that, once in humans, it was transmitted from human to human.
This is very important when determining how to intervene, because contact tracing is paramount.
The virus has also been found to mutate as it moves between humans.
Every mutation is important because diagnostics, vaccines, and our therapies are all based on genome sequence. This is the guide.
Global health experts need to respond, develop and recalibrate all their work accordingly.
But science doesn't work that way. My position at the time was that I had the data and I could have worked in silos for months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted an article for publication, made some changes, and finally published my data after the official release.
This is how the status quo in science works.
This time, there is no question of doing so.
We had friends on the ground. For us, it was obvious that we needed help, a lot of help ...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine released the first sequences, was to publish them on the web.
We published them and appealed for help.
And help came!
Quickly, many people contacted us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the world's leading infectious disease specialists were part of our community.
We were working together virtually, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to form such communities.
Everyone, when the epidemic began to spread globally, wanted to learn, participate, and engage.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was incredible, and the Internet connected us all.
Can you imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, we said, "OK, let's go, working together,
We will defeat this virus. »
The problem was that the data we were using, when searching the web, was too limited for our purpose.
A lot of opportunities are wasted in these cases.
So when the outbreak started in Kenema, we had 106 patient clinical records, and we made them public.
In our lab, we demonstrated that, armed with these 106 records, we could teach our computers to predict Ebola with about 100% accuracy.
We have developed an application that gives access to this information to on-site healthcare workers.
Unfortunately, 106 cases are not enough to consolidate and validate the data.
So we were waiting for more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
We are still waiting, confined to our silos, instead of working together.
This situation is no longer tolerable.
You, all of you, can no longer accept this.
Our lives are at stake.
Many people lost their lives, health workers, including colleagues who were dear to me. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many others in Kenema and beyond, dead, while the world waited and we worked, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion and division.
As we build barriers between us, the virus grows.
Unlike all other threats, in the face of Ebola, we are all equal.
We are all in this together.
Ebola is on the threshold of all of us.
And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, strengths, fears and hopes, I hope that we can work together and with pleasure.
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the term "Kenema", the hospital where we work, in Sierra Leone, comes from Mende's quote for "clear as a river, translucent and open to the eyes".
It meant a lot to us because, without knowing it, we had always believed that to honour individuals at Kenema, we had to work openly and together.
We have to do it.
We must all demand of ourselves and others to be open to others, when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together.
Because this is neither the first Ebola outbreak, nor the last, and there are many other pathogens lurking around us, like the Lassa virus.
The next outbreak could affect a city of millions of people.
It could start there and be transmitted by air.
It could even be disseminated intentionally.
I know it's scary, I understand... But I also know, this experience proves to us, that we have the technology and the ability to defeat, to defeat and get ahead of other viruses.
But this is only possible if we collaborate in joy.
For Dr. Khan, and for all those who gave their lives, on the front, in this fight with us, let us stand with them in this struggle. Always.
Let us not leave the world with the scars of the destruction caused by a virus. Let us illuminate it with the brilliance of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
