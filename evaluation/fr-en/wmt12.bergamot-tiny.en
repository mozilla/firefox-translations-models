Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
At second reading, MEPs rejected the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for entering into a predomitable agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko describes the judgement as a political revenge of the regime and has provoked a process of suspicion of bias of the court also in the west.
The plan to repeal paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Abandafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia law and we already know what it is all about.
Libya is becoming a country without crime because for a theft we cut off.
Women may forget about emancipation, and non-percentives who may be faith are subject to the death penalty...
It is the Koran that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya, such an order will reign as we cannot represent it to ourselves and as we would surely not like.
But our way of living is not unique, is not objectively the best, and probably would not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly astonishing that Islamist warriors have accepted help with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse was that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes, but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shooting, serving Islam, and our poilitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not in the military occupation of Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crosses".
Without soil occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold?
Perhaps not as much and the West will finally be able to boast about the protection of human rights.
As long as we prevent these sharia followers from doing so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the investor visor.
A tornado of statistics passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published the real-digital information on GDP for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all the records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published their visions of economic development earlier for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has a projected growth of 0.5%, and France's GDP by 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter, when Germany ranked better than expected (by 0.3 per cent instead of the forecast of 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (caused of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated, and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that there is a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to the data forecast and recalculated periodically.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared with the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' forecast.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 per cent.
The yield on ten-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The yields on the bonds of Spain and Italy are on the rise to critical limits.
Problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The yields on Czech bonds are kept below 4% while the situation in the region worsens.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the ultimate guarantee.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football made its most difficult mission of the season.
In Montenegro, it also won thanks to the super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also been very lucky in the second part and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second part.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains found themselves under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vicitism of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a prize of 200 million kroner in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes we played a warlike football.
Both teams were difficult to mount combinations and the game focused mainly around the center line.
The pressure of national footballers failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred college students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme with this gesture in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began praying at noon at the site and then called for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan's universities created a human shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is transformed.
They have thus openly expressed that they will defend their country's nuclear agenda at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students began praying at noon at the site and then called for the death of the US and Israel.
In the case of an attack, the objective of which would be to destroy Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: don't eat breakfast not and drinks for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9 per cent of schoolchildren have overweight weights and 5 per cent are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human person lives and the models around them.
On the tables of obese children, for example, carbies are 50 per cent more often than in the families of children with normal weights.
19% of obese people had french fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the big boys, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents find time for the active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 pupils from the sixth to the third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, or even obese, children are unable to eat properly and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned indicates, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case--luce--shop-dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and dinner meats
Specialists draw attention to the fact that in order to have healthy development requires a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of students' families eat at the same time.
In most of the families, each has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been raised is that one tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fried fried frenchries in obese children are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of children questioned play sports regularly, but for parents it is only half, only 15 per cent.
Get your food ready
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from possibilities according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal level towards a healthy diet".
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
'Most alarming is in particular a great preference for sweet lemonades,' is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place just in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starchy foods at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are prepared to change their habits as soon as they receive ad hoc information.
"During a check-up by a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' awareness, the results of the survey have been determined to move towards a healthy diet," says the results of the survey.
The most significant was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often ticked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main course and would reduce sweet and knedliky dishes (the Czech specialty of bread flour or potato dumpsters).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little bit angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
Presentations by three professionals in the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it will be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "stuff".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) treated the way to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women like this are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no particular curve, another one is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically emmenu large arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to emphasize the character beautifully and also not to dress too voyantly types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between size and hips in such a way that skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it is worth making it to be made to measure.
And you won't regret it because the clothes that fall impeccably is priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slids continuously, roll up and does not fit the belt and so on.
For those with a masculine appearance may afford Tucker-style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabric, or embroidery.
There are, of course, a lot of examples of different appearances and I'm glad I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that I'm going to do at home there's too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We have to take into consideration the current appearance, the kind of personality mode as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Meranda Kerr, maybe you know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
In my heart, it pleases me, because it's better than dressing up Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work on the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship to graphic creation.
Also thinking about the graphical part of the styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress the physical but create, for example, the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphic designer, told us all about this.
But that,... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look at Saturday's session filled with information about different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single dress in a different way.
The variability is for this prime example.
Like, for example, this trench coat that must be worn conventionally with jeans and a T-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a picture of it as a dress.
Or just pull up your sleeves or the collar and have a new look right away.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: 'For work you need to know the rules perfectly'.
"You can then start to fight it," said Jakub.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have many more clothing variants than those photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story which will have about ten pages (therefore a dozen models) I must be ready to "reheat" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count on this when creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make up half the success story was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a great singer, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of the stylists is still cautious.
And the known faces sometimes consider them to be useless (it is enough for me to know something but what I'm looking is going to be second).
And if someone gets styling from us, then we have to rely on the fact that they dictate to us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than they actually have.
Then we just have to sail on Google and make sure that the boulevard news reports the celebrity in question, whether it has become thinner or magnified, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on the heart on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not boasting, keeping your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his cabinet and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, my God what horror."
"You'll find some things you'll find pretty and he'll advise you to wear with," Mario said.
It has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is known as the 'placovka' or sack of the stylist must contain.
It's the one you hang around the waist and you have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for depilation or even nannies, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of clip)
So that we're not just looking at people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly squeeze shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could damage, a fortiori outside.
And so we glued and pasted.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to be inadvertently injured.
So we really need skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes.
I'm beginning to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The Run is competing across America.
Revision
Originally a trouble-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning trip to work.
This fulfils everyone's ambition to some extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled section The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the old Need for Speed racing series and release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the passages added will be in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was being matched.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing is pulling down because of a few unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're caught up in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has problems that are characteristic and to fix them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the steering wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The itinerary is divided into ten stages and then in more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is made on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite distinct from one another and are interesting.
The player doesn't feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty enough even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
Well, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are, in addition, to time, adorned with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility to you.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche doesn't fall on you.
In addition to this, the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments you try to surpass the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the time (classic with the chronometer) and then still wait for you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and who are trying to restore the situation to you.
Novelty is off-vehicle passages.
It's more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by typing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer moments of this kind than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
To the result, this is well like this because this element is not likely to interfere with and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that adorn the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is currently nothing extraordinary, but it cannot be said that it is negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although we can find better in the concreteness the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So it's all ok.
Problems begin to emerge after a certain period of time.
Unlike the driving model, the difference in collisions is not yet in the light of the driving model.
We don't expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you don't, in a collision with any object, have the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy voltiges.
Or is found in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system, this is not really a problem, but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken your face or you have come out in the decor the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the itinerary.
But you only have five restarts.
When you've used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't happen right, that something you can actually rely on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found by removing the piece of itinerary in question from memory.
The big problem with this game is that the same actions end up in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that have to be made in a certain way, otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you encounter in a given place "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What makes you angry are situations when you see the opponent passing easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction, and when you arrive, you either have to set aside and conturn or brake.
It's equal if you go to the front of it because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the weather, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most energized at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The adversary must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good number of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaloreline, but it is clear that you are getting bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of racing is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the races.
You have to pay attention to the gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars there, however most of the time the one you have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight highways and sports supercars with exotic sports on highly technical pipelines, for example on yaw roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know about adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects start unlocking:
This one connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and gives you other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends you the car directly to scrap.
At the time of writing we had a discussion for a few days as to whether anyone really thought about when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is inconvenient is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer of any use to you.
The sound part is good and the track is to be chosen.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest public, a new soundtrack was created in the "I mix everything" style, but it can be expected that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could safely say that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The amusement is really good, but get ready for mistakes hitting your eyes with the force of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
The Treaty of Lisbon has radically eliminated the balance between the institutions
"I didn't expect such a tough war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role", which is how Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law, Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different organs of the EU and their relations so comprehensiblely and visibly, to the point that a large number of lecturers at the Charles University's Faculty of Law could envy him, she showed how much she took her motto 'undercomprehensible and openly about Europe' very seriously.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that it is bland, that it is a leather-round, that it cannot refill any mission and I must say that it has taken everyone's breath away because it takes its role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 Member States, to communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take of Europe.'
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is to the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", so as an important step towards uniqueness and a greater legibility of EU policy vis-à-vis states, as is China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that the European Council has lived through, lived and lived in a close time.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a successful one.
The Czechs had resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or had organized a summit for an Oriental Partnership.
She described the fall of the grudge as a very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, 'the activity has been in full swing, not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis, which continues to be resolved even now.
In addition, the Union's new seven-party budget, which is becoming very complicated, should be approved because of the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, at least, everything is to be resolved in future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels 'For an understandable Europe'.
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas that are different, large or that no one has prevented us from doing syrecky."
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the Czech Ambassador, they have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault stems, in her view, from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad still doing? And he is not at all happy.'"
According to Vicenova, in the near future it is new harsh rules on fiscal policy that await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe that prevails rather than a 'new European Federation'.
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation".
Firstly, it was said that the countries that want them to cooperate with each other and those that do not wish to do so remain in their corner."
'There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe,' Expects Vicenova.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases that all issues with an impact on the EU must be discussed among all EU members and not just the same eurozone.
History of a brand:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the term that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the nearest would be "long-term".
For a large audience, IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm that is felt to be very current and yet since its inception it has passed a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was cast by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan 'PENSE' has become the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to edit in 1935).
It was the basis of Watson's careful enterprise culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years because it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
It allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more" depleted for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to care for his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and companions.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
Society was initially awesome in the discovery of talent -- as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and could thus have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Chief Sales, Marketing and Strategy Officer.
IBM in recent years has done what's called jamy, online brain-torning from which many future strategies and innovations come from.
It's no wonder he has a lot of ideas -- in the company there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a secure position in the business sector.
"Since the beginning of IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
'IBM is not a technological firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world using its technology,' added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM – or the “Big Blue,” as it is colloquially called in the United States, given its slogan – in a hundred years it grew to become one of the world’s largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries includes, for example, the cash dispenser, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Early overview
Not all innovations and manufacturing were preferred by the customer and at the time - IBM for example failed to bet on a OS/2 own operational system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr:
"The moment your business is built on the forward movement you can't emotionally stick to the past," remarked Samuel J. Palmisano.
To do this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they are not working it is going away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft concerant, which at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, in 1990 she was more of the most contentious participation moti.
Beginning in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for 15 billion dollars, over the course of which it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of technology perspectives.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it has surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the major economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
It now appears that IBM is going through the current crisis undisturbed?
The price of the IBM share has progested by 120 per cent since 2008, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
This can be expected that this flexible giant will control other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City a hundred years ago; it was originally the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - originally it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is related to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then cast a shadow over the founder of the firm - it was on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of society have so far been based.
Watson ran the firm kusqu in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machinery for business and trade - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of operating, the turnover increased to 9 million dollars and began to expand the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years in leadership it was his son who held the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s people and computers helped NASA guide flight in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and 1969 flight to the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard at the time with the name IBM 5150 entered the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to provide high added value for advice and services.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM over the last three years – is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to intelligently use technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as the IBM trade area developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform recently ago that helps traders to manage the entire trade cycle.
IBM has a strong history also in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing center.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team dealing with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore.
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over.
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (aged 45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in her summer in Bartosova in her house, she had no idea that her couple wouldn't.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push back the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved him.
Over time Darina resigned herself, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome her in the doorstep of the house.
"He's my sons' biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He won't be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova filtered, showing that she detached herself from her husband but only stayed in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife has set up a paper wedding and I respect it."
"The company continues, I'm dealing with repairs, in the garden, in real estate, I'm buying."
"With Darina we're talking in a completely normal way, but we're not sleeping together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he will not prevent it.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she's going, with whom and if she has an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with 'Iveta and I take all the responsibility on me,' Joseph concluded.
Women's worst vices: Does that also affect you?
If you ask men to determine typical women's vices, both of them are able to get them out of their sleeve.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines women's vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
Procurement
Does your half make you any comments that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and in packs at the time of the sales?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion to shop.
But you'll say, which would resist the window-shopping of clothing stores, looking for pretty clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Remind you only how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose weight at least five kilos - should I start playing sports?"
"Do you like it?"
Do these sentences not remind you of something?
Yes?
So you're one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about their appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the higher the frequency of such complaints and the more poisoning women become.
Theodity and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite carousel.
Wash the windows, vacuum, clean the floors, dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children they have soiled the washbasin, clogged the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In just the event that you suffer from this obsession, try to bear in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This innocent desire for cleanliness can, however, spoil your relations and even family peace.
The work of undermining
"That this garment garment worn out."
"Are you going to put these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this work on your partner to do this quiet several times a day, you're really going to break it down.
It's obvious that you don't think wrongly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much work to be surprised...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflage, and insults against someone are also unique to some women.
Women are particularly connected and so content to deal with subjects as who, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is a special feature of women.
But the worst is those who advise, persifle, even despise others and are for those around them - particularly at work in a collective of women - that are particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by participating in the Philadelphia victory
Hokey striker Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL match on Caroline's ice and again led the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player in the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr also scored two goals in the game.
Jagr after the match told reporters in the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action, Giroux scored a goal of the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes's goals for the puck and presented it to the striker Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer raided, but the beginning of the second game belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr, he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I would play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ended with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended two to one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area".
"He knocked on the puck, I got off the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," says the last goal of the match from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in second third party due to an injury in the upper body.
The Canadians did not hold against an experienced defender their two-goal lead lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the backline was sick that mostly annoyed the local trainer rather than lost poins because they played the match with only 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We played the game only with one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," said Jacques Martin.
'Replacement on replacement it was not enough and we could not resist.'
"We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Czech defender Ondrej Pavelec took part in the Winnipeg 30th attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters competed in the Jets' goals, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotick, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A large exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and then the regime began to have an inclination for the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the event that the citizen Czechoslovak wishes to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he or she needed a letter of invitation, otherwise the individual journey was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the West, but it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The currency agreement that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, redeemable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the foreign currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs were buying up and this habit has lasted until now.
The travel of the Czechs has since undergone a great revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the western neighbouring countries of the 1990s caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel by air to the west for long, which everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a boarding house.
The typical feature of a trip by Czechs was at that time to take with one's own preserved food, sausage, etc. to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna, which finally allowed our tourists after decades to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average wages have increased, which has led to another important time around 1997.
Thanks to the growing demand for travel, travel agents have been beginning since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter flights which, through contracts, have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s of the last century, Czechs had visa-free routes with almost most developed countries around the world apart from the US, which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism was prepared, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic was prepared.
Since then, every year direct air charters have taken Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year.
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 kroons per person on holidays abroad including related charges. Crowns per person.
The general assembly must find its president, but this is likely to end with a situation without a "one pat" solution.
Almost five months already Czech football is without a President and he risks Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Czech Republic Football Association not yet known after a General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement according to which voting rules should be made.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football went back to differences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on 16 September when it came to the selection of a new president.
General Assembly delegates met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained stalled and there was no even talk of dealing with the way of electing.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only he would seem to be statutory representatives or also staff members with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance also of the Office for the State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue to be on the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also brought nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the hotspot is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The bone of contention is the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model", said one of the three vice-presidents of the Dusan Svoboda Football Association of the Czech Republic, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the model in the proposed third round, the candidate who received the most votes as a percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire in order to win the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes in both chambers.
And the Czech side is looking at the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept", admits Svoboda, which includes the Megaave's objections and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote in accordance with the Statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the settlement of elections established according to the Statutes is the most of the Pelta's advantages.
"I hope that the maximum vote will be voted on in accordance with the statutes of the association".
"To ensure that there are not yet any absurd ideas imagined by a representative as in past General Assemblies", said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate and who in his presentations has been mostly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk, there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone".
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there is more energy for cooperation" adds Jablonec's officer, who has the greatest experience in leading football both professional and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense".
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to change the design regulations."
"This may again cause blockage to the General Assembly".
"I still hope that healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for mutual agreement with all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say whether the entire football direction will be complete for the match.
The chartered flight to Podgorice, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl did not take off for technical reasons, and a variant was being sought to take a part of the executive committee in the field of reprisals.
At the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth and Sports Education Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts of the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union, which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is going into the fight for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen footballer leader Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for for a new President of the Czech Republic Football Association (RTA), he would not be campaigned for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for the election."
'But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate,' Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation was to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from reaching the head of the AFRT who would a priori be given a favourite for this election.
Paclik also stressed that, should he win the election, he would hold the post of President only until 2013 the year for a General Assembly.
He would see in the job a manager who is experienced and of high level but who is not linked to the world of football.
'I talked to people who would have the profile,' he said.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
'I'd like to change this image,' he added.
What is said to be inconveniences Paclik, especially is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of counter-countered fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates ' the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, this would be even less favourable to football", proclaimed Paclik.
What still shockes him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during the course of listening in the context of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any difficulty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen club".
Should Paclik triumph over Thursday's vote, he would have to prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly who had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as the head of the representation".
"But as an Association manager he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put a nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September got a lot of attention when he spoke of the annulment of the referees' Commission with Ludek Macela, whom Dagmar Damkova replaced.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level to head the Association.
He took as an example his ability to run private firms and which he had also led the Plzen club, which had been celebrating with his support last May its triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would slow down the influence of certain interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, leading to bad taste," added Paclik, who did not chase his antipathy to Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobby for high-level policies would make it possible to obtain more gambling tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should be dealing with."
'If it's the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money is going,' he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to the situation of pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, AFRT would have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels over the electoral settlement.
Jablonec's official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that today's success in football should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta before the unfulhengized September election promised to devote himself to national representation and obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to stand as a candidate at the last moment immediately before the previous General Assembly, and that two-month delay might well enable him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and waiting for a President to be a President on Thursday".
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily related to the Jablonec club, has worked a large number of years in Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
That's also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of the statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone noticed".
"If there weren't all these various interpretations, we would have already had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take him as a personal mission and be prepared to take all responsible for it in the event that it does not work."
'It's a principle without which we can't exist,' added Pelta.
Then he is said to try not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges with regard to his legal training and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate will be his first Vice-President.
He has also long attacked Tonas Paclik, who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing in football for a year and has already had a few successful appearances."
"His attacks were not the most honourable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"It is also for this reason that some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent, but remained, he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon was his knowledge of football from the lowest level to national representation.
It should be a football window.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that begin with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sectors so that we could get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his nomination at the head of football would not lead to any change of person.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said in Strahov, where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no leadership.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of contention on how to vote in the third round we will be able to surpass it."
"Football needs credibility and he will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," as Pelta optimistically says two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected the new President of the Czech Republic Football Association at Thursday's General Assembly, he seems.
Rajchl promised, however, that if he was elected, we would start working hard.
He wanted systemic changes and made the members of the Executive Committee accountable for different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance football for young people."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members deals with a specific field."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
'Many people will not be happy because it will start working hard rather than criticize others,' he added.
He said that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I have people behind me who keep sticking me in the wheels and put doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people told me anyway that I don't have to give up because they would also give up."
'It's a trust I can't betray,' he said.
What motivates him, it is also said, is to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a great job of fact and I do not want to let it go."
'There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years' time and I would not like anyone to stop them.' he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation in the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and this is something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who were playing football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for putting up with one."
"I try to be objective".
"I want to do football for everyone because not only everyone will be happy with it
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are some who say otherwise, I am ready to do the utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other morave, the winners of which would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as it is currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl could not assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be a success", said Rajchl, who considers in his future success, to save tens of millions of kroner on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on contracts with televisions and the law on games.
On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association was not united was a common mistake.
While he said about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him Czech football would lose credibility", he thought that the second opponent Paclik was a strong candidate who had enough to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his success," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO optic patches, beautiful pools in Budapest: Travelling through Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in flullaneous water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool we can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted swimming pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she noted in her notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were probed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain". The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historic bath palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
It has driven its "travels to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true staunch in the bath culture.
Meder, explains that she is not very interested in sport but she feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming fans must simply contemplate blue tiles and live with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe the enchanting fragrance of spruce forests or can listen to zeal zealous birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools actually have to be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I was starting a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface doubly reinforces the architecture
A dive into a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in swimming rooms are enormous because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have sorrowed a little bit more, the rooms to swim could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All the surfaces are optically in a double manner: high vaults, multicolored tiles, trepanels.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a 190-page report of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered notable examples during her research in Hungary.
In addition to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found water containing nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (cavern bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of therms whose pools are filled with water containing alkaline and (Vasi Term-l-l)
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the bath you have the whole city in its eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. John's. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which the animation can be seen on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits the swimmers in Lungenfeld: The Aqua Dome Otztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains rise from the Otztal to the sky.
Alhambra in the black forest
The smell of bleach does not emanate from all the swimming pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate from a smell of sulphur, from the Hungarian Bekescsaba in the Hungarian Bekescsaba comes from a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silts you stick to the skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free, outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by the archbishop Dusan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the flowering of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad's Baths Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have been released since its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra-style magurized room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favourite bath of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because she is from Schwarzwald.
'It's already a beautiful yield to melt building styles so different into such a great unit,' says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines speculation on raw materials in detail
From Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wanted to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities pushes prices upwards and banks share complicity in global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in concrete contrast to the head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though the big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Cpublishing on commodities was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that gamblers have detached from offers and demand - and take advantage of the very poor at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from US competitors: he promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no business is worth jeopardizing Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review is due to be completed by the end of the year, and then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with a recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the Chief of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could lead to a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode praised the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: 'Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly recent way that today's banks are damaging the general interest.'
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under mandatory today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation", said Bode.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr Ackermann, whether it's about the hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group's CEO wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board will not change what is planned in the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve his brand image with a shift away from controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about it -- his successor will care.
One in two would terminate the investments on the raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the Manager under a strong pressure.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires from 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just eleven per cent have found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all the investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
49% would advise against such a bank to those around them, 49% said that they would consider terminating their account to change their banking institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture story with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibitions won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
It is now open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, glass hangars, bright and bold gaits and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction of steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to the present day an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World's Fair.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the World's Fair in the Swiss Garden at the South Vienna Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum -- no walls to hang artwork, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now called "Maison du 21ème siècle" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new start was completed by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things, in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she carried out particularly the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public and private sponsorship funds.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited, a café and bookstore are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and sensibly expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew of the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in generosity and lightness following its travel to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the 'building was 'an energy abyss', says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements made room for the new farm, a dim-in panel of light between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge driven to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remained, the house was painted in a shade protection against red-brown rust.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision by the authorities competent for monuments and with a small budget.
'Often good and inexpensive materials had to be found, and which also please the Monuments Protection Office,' says Krischanitz and he draws attention to raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the edifice has remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the newly planned "central station district", with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may be going to happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the Francesca von Habsburg collector bought the Berlin Temporary Art Center, and as it is said, it is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily newspaper "Bild"-zeitung first reported on the basis of an internal crisis plan to the group that investments totalling around EUR 300 million would be foreseen until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the removal of snow from railway installations and platforms, among other things, should double and increase to 16,000.
The aim is to rid the docks of snow and ice until the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the railway station chief R-diger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train crashes that took place this winter as well.
Last winter, the railway company had enormous problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for authorisation from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been able to do for years, as it has to have the axles of the ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after an axle break has occurred on an ECI in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank 'Deutsche Bank' has to pay a fines of millions.
As if Deutsche Bank’s problems were not already sufficient, the giant’s past of the sector is catching up with it in the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison to USD 145 million (EUR 106 million) to resolve a dispute over the collapse of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA brings a number of charges to large banks, and that they have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about buying financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and dragged banks down.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution on this subject, without the parties starting a court proceeding," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not acknowledge in comparison with any fault.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed a payment in the amount of 20.5 million dollars.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US co-operative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks to party and in the summer he sued JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The issue of mortgage documents is concerned, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though events are already a few years old, it is currently blowing a stormy wind on US banks.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous lawsuits for redress or sanctions for breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It criticizes 18 major international banks, the two US state-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac financiers for having advantaged themselves in kind in kind in mortgages of about 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with FHFA, which is a total of USD 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities call for the Frankfurter to answer "substantial losses" but without giving a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wished to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett up by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, is investing huge sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains that it does not invest in IT IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies reveals only poor predictions.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in the sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM offered mainly services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
A investment by Warren Buffett is seen as a knight attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business is granted the right to now call itself "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic issue, which he has bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment holding company became a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5%.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had secured reasonable profits.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time been focusing on lucrative IT services as operating accounting centres.
The pioneer in computing, over 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting and high-performance business computers.
Buffett had previously avoided tech companies.
He says that he only invests in the companies he understands.
On the contrary, Buffett tackles rail freight, lubricants or machine manufacturers.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares with a range of major groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Ruckneus of Munich.
This 80-year-old in his 60s took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and made it one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible meaning for making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock market.
"Big Blue," as IBM also calls itself, has a stock market value of more than 220 billion dollars and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "cell of 'wickauer', the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
One newspaper even talks about a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the Turkic population are reacting with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, the spectre that has been thought to have been dead long has re-emerged: since the incendiary attacks in May 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
Although there was xenophobia in Germany, however, it had never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network which has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is it a return to bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily newspaper 'Haberturk'.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, on the other hand, that one of the authors was a v-man of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the extreme right-wing quarry.
The Turkish community in Germany has rightly reacted in a reasoned way: this weekend it has called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony on the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media are slaps: "Germany's gift for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - 'Haber X', which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the 'Hurriyet' does not prevent itself from drawing on its unambiguous conditions.
"it starts stinging", is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Kolahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was very critically perceived in the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already been in the minds of the German authorities much earlier to carry out research in certain suspected extreme right circles, the authors are astonished.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: 'If the matter continues to be botched, there will be nothing left with migrants other than self-defence and armament'.
"It will be the best self-defense."
'Inner peace in Germany is highly dependent on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the whole network,' writes 'Selen'.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mulln and Solingen in the 1990s have been well explained.
The picture of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened our senses in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was above all the failure of German policy after the attacks in the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mulln.
After the fire in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish people were.
As if the value of a man could be valued on the amount of his tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how profound the distrust of many German-Turkish people has been to the local rule of law since then.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake Lake Scandal Bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined for himself.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July that he would occupy an almost as spectacular post in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved strength and made it a mocking comment on future colleagues.
"UBS succeeded in the Turnaround".
"I am delighted with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gracbel".
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank's security systems and had skyrocketed around EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Granbel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since been considered to be suffering - and all of them ask: When does Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And it will take over the administration presidency already in May – not in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
All of a sudden, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again once again that it has long deserved the title of 'Europe's largest scandal bank'.
Indeed, the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, it has been swasting for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS was managing on the one hand in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more money from an affluent clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later a bank professor for many years in zurich recounts: 'I've always taken the UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students.'
'In the current perspective, we wonder: how could I have simply been so wrong?'
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, who was previously considered a top intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, it was anticipated why he had left.
The bank's division had skyrocketed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and crossed it.
To that end, she did find investors, but who, shortly before, would have gathered her eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and an Arab state, which was ignored, to the point where her name was never even learned.
It was only the first time.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to announce billions of losses again, board chairman Marcel Ospel, who was still the second highest-paid board in Switzerland in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors, in the pre-bankruptcy financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank has bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation has donated six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total of the 2007 UBS balance sheet rose to more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
'We haven't been able to save UBS again,' said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second disaster followed.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the affluent customer base, which had defrauded the tax authorities perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, the Commission accepted a payment of USD 780 million for the reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions with a fine plus.
For example, UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax evasion.
And, as there was a somewhat return to calm, and as was thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed with this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single stock dealer flamboys 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking, this still does not seem to work.
'With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk management has changed too little,' says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University's Banking Institute.
So the financial director of a major German bank is sure: 'the problem with the UBS is that it does not have the control of risks in hand.'
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long held their job, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprengli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS's central office in zurich is still in line with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already conventional.
The Bank is headquartered at the central station in zurich, which leads directly from the central station to the lake, which is itself surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, and shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers such as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss stores of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprengli confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Palais du Crédit Suisse to elitist private banks such as Julius Boer.
We arrive in the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are coated with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other removed from the market – or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Crédit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, in the end, as all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too big, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing left to say.
"And even though they have long adapted to the mores of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle like the great Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of small countries with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hossig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and has been constantly increasing.
What has helped is that the two different pre-recessy UBS banks have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy, with asset management as a strong point in the management of assets in the city and a poorer, but certainly already more highly internationalised.
Suddenly, international investment banks had good access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
'I've always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team,' said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets along very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with learning about the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end on Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders in which the leader of the Wuffli group always gave the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already been successful.
In foreign currency and securities transactions, it played a very important role.
However, the company advisers, who were responsible for this, stressed a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the jargon of "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have shortcomings in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it his life.
Stuck-hungry for growth is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed value documents based on American mortgages – but also kept risks.
Even when other banks had long been trying to go down.
'Still in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was on fire, the UBS bought there,' says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more the fall is abrupt.
One manager after another had to leave, when ending the attempts turned out to be more difficult than previously thought.
UBS posts have become ejectable and have so far been syllables.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has one idea: to put an end to investment banking, to concentration to asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be a transitional measure when the bank secreted it surprisingly from its predecessor Grabel.
In the meantime, it has come to grips with the UBS business on a long-term basis, the Bank of zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of play of the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He has only said publicly until now that he was going to fetch an apartment with his wife.
Next year.

Smart crows spread to cities
In many places, brotherly people are considered a "bird problem." But experts say that these very intelligent animals haven't been hunted from cities for a long time.
Some like them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cwwls have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents'repairs are on the rise due to dirt and animal noise.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on the crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive the brothers out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors were also basking the problems of cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected frarian: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, equipping and felling of typical incubator trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 incubation pairs in the westflischen Soest, in the northwest, including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
By 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements as a result of the massacre of the crows in that region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal clubs.
"Cordinarily eviction, ouring, is useless," noted Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klever.
The destruction of nests with pressurized water or felling trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr to Baden-Wurttemberg.
"Animals are moving away, large colonies are being divided and they are being dispersed in other places."
The 'enceception' is only imaginable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves obliged to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceable is a combination of animal ouel to an aversary packaging and catchy offers, in order to allow them to be relocated.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Joergens was looking for "infoal panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
He co-founded the Ascheberger-Draft-Framework of the baskets at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing the life of these very intelligent brothers.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
He gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: 'Here is a large number of communications, these birds have a lot to say to each other'.
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: The cold people not only use working tools to arrive at a feast, but they make their own tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge tested four brotherly recently, how much the intelligence of birds is coming.
In one experiment, birds soon learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones to achieve a larva.
Without much training, they determined that a stone had to have some size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second test, the astute cows then had to solve a more squatted problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their loot with their beak.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished for the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brotherly were even successful from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo scores Portugal at 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks at once remained unsuccessful.
Favorites from Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the European championships in Poland and broke Ukraine's final rounds.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal erred against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the playoff return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more burning in Turkey's 0:0 draw against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other pulls for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga player Wolfsburg, Avjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre-penality played by hand (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut to Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a 30-metre free kick in advance into the mesh.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his remote-shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to do 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to forward Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship in Manchester City, initiated a head ball directed to the underside of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek shot a goal for the Czech
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the centre of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the side, Stark granted a controversial 11-metre penalty after Fabio Coentrao's action that Misimovic probably diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 Vice-Campion of Europe made four strokes and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also placed the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European Champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had to be lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by Tomas Sivok potential (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair area right next to the Cech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class Czechs guard already shot, again, the FC attacker Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey was in the process of playing the time in the world.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also similarly had to abandon his place on the bench of one third of the EM in 2002, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, Kazim Kazim attacker could not even bury the ball for the purpose.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62th Minute, the legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first stake in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken charge of the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute, with a success of 4:0 a success.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) tied for visitors.
Ireland pushed to the next gear from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the Estonian defence could the Estonian defence have prevented a possible goal from the first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and shook the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Up to 2015, around USD 2 billion (EUR 1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
'We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly,' said CEO Bill McDermott to his customers on a fair footing in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)", said McDermott.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Slaughter of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. Entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that clamp your heart.
One piece of advice to start with: tear this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You'll get to know these people in detail. In this novelty story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Here he wrote an extraordinary book that he accurately describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." There are "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and sorrow" sums up the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulances and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war. Some will lose limbs, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives falter here like the candles of a church: as some go out, we're throwing new ones up.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He refuted the idea that the First World War consisted only of the terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" cleverly describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one Pass Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invaded the lives of those people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina that stinks the cordite.
When cannon beatings sound in the distance, and you are a mother at home, do you stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to get by.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It continues on alternative food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a false wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
It states that "837 authorised substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honour and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and says about the war: 'You feel that after all, that's what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there's no barbaric shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When you're resigned to sacrificing ourselves, you hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it is rather comparable to "a man condemned strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a story of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasped the arrival of what he called "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease with prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
'The most grotesque expression is found in the gonorrhoea trade, which soldiers buy and 'spole on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,' he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasped how the war "triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion. "
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory", or "At the Far Thhat New", by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I've read in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he's out of his book, seized from your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot control helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret to all, with the exception of a few high-ranking officers, as well as others informed from the outset that they would conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the department's regulations and caused a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean up the park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police officers had prepared themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was held on the island of Randall, with a view to the operation at the park of the town.
Police officers receive better training against the riots -- counter-terrorism measures that quickly move a large number of policemen -- to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The final training session was held on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park got "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"The few policemen I know who were called did not know that they would go to the park," the person was anonymist.
"The only ones to say that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, police officers wanted to clean up the park but were repulsed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal quarters.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went into the park during the day, like migrants. One hour in the morning was therefore a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the fewest people", he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The resounding lights and recorded messages of the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As the officers of community affairs entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreaks, many demonstrators simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit before 1.45 a.m. stated that the police, allowing the occupiers to collect their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were needed.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of the Police Department, claimed that the measure had been taken only by security.
However, according to many journalists, the police were prevented from observing the intervention inside the park, which was severely held by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the trucks of television cameras on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the thick business clutter of the demonstrators, including luggage, plastic turf and bags of sheets filled with clothes, sewerage teams were monitoring, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were made available on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of demonstrators took centre location near the encampment's kitchen, not far from the centre of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the Police moved to orderly arrest.
About 10 people at the epicentre of the encampment clung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called upon to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3.30 a.m. Kelly.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended approximately one and a quarter hours later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them for "disturbing public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer to be on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations", said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the eastern side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block in the north of the park, as well as on Pine Street in the south.
The police have been seen to expand the perimeter far beyond the park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were spotted punctured the tyres of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood sprang up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school-age union sued the city for dismissals
The trade union, which represents hundreds of school aides who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs. The impact is disproportionate on schools with disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the 37th District Council of the union in an attempt to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, among the lowest paid in the city, lost their jobs on 7 October. Trade union leaders compared these layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city to gain access to a health care fund run by the groups of workers, which would have made it possible to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that the layoffs constituted part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council responded, mentioning that the dismissals of school aids were in no way specified in the budget.
The 37th District Council officers stated that they would complete a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to officially announce the legal proceedings at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City's Department of Education will constitute the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight dismissed female workers, all of their black or Latin American origin, such as most of the school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by The New York Times, the union reportedly relied on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no dismissals on Staten Island, and barely a few at the establishments in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants to Harlem Public School 36, where 68% of students live in poverty, prosecutions state that "It is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for the 36-School Public School has been reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each underprivileged student.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo allowing the dismissal of parents'counsels.
The memo used the term "overrun" to describe the action, even though "exceedance" more generally describes the move of a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixteen parents' coordinators were dismissed", and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya's issue
In the end, it seems that Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the lifting in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat – Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican – Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "race".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country", said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution to allow limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure to cut funding for US operations in Libya.
So the US mission has remained in the form of legislative purgatory – Congress that is sufficiently upset to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut off the grass under his feet.
Congressional indecisiveness was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "recognizes the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as last June?
Senator and Chairman of Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week for a constitutional amendment to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without having tried.
Goodlatte's amendment was one of 68 constitutional amendments to be tabled in Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others vary slightly from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that "would control federal spending".
Some of these bills are the same, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to turn their CVs - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was approved last August, called for the vote of the House and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms for members of Congress to serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the limit of two terms for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage was perpetually proposed, as was the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the states are opposed to them.
As eager as members were to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed down in the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacreed but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat-Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday night, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on Broadway and said that he wanted to recover rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared on the television news "20/20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show addressed its difficult return following the ball that fractured its skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, ri ri and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather good".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special retracing Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, with his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with the doctors, said he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
When she was reinstated, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I would say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get by, get back and get back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration, and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie suits stood at his feet to cheer him.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of spring fundraising.
A military officer present at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were portrayed as an orphan," the military senior officer wrote in an email.
I am sure that the organisers had good intentions.
I know that.
But that wasn't respect. Just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have taken hold between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise be given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves into the role of unlucky minds."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognizable or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place confidentially among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service in two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and traveled to faraway lands.
Others would ask whether "an angry and violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work at the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were giving him interviews subtly asked whether he would be able to stand under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely praised by a country so unfamiliar with the military and has few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army in the face of increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a senior hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go on trial against the military for alleged inaction about rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has put aside its concern.
I thought: no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown on the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and others not, will anxiously wait for the court decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the widespread use of rape in the army, thus running counter to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to attack the kinned military, as the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? Leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants together in this case - thus putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will bring several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by US lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted or not by soldiers on duty for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Fictrine Feres, the Federal Government is not liable for injuries sustained by active-duty personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the complainants'military service", the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not, officially, have the right to go into combat, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in getting in touch with local women.
As a result, in both wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize, according to Susan Burke.
It is not alone in this fight: three more trials are in progress in addition to its own.
At Yale Law School, the veterans' legal service center is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personal disorders" attributed to rape victims to leave them - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were introduced in Congress with a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of legal proceedings: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were tried - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The Susan Burke case described their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell her rape 11 times in detail to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting in front of a judge, at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the yard."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember telling my commander, 'It wasn't his trial but mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was dismissed under less than honourable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Will the Lyman and other plaintiffs or not go ahead, is this a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington, Faculty of Law.
However, he remarked, 'In my opinion, they should be able to move forward'.
Only this doctrine, which has been criticized since its introduction, is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Iron Doctrine.
The army is behind decades because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence as a responsibility.
'Opportunities are heavily against them... but it's important that they try,' he adds.
These things change only when the good guys have the will to fight.
If the trial does not revolve in their favour, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue as long as there is no reform", she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy expressing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from murderous madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being acting on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them again," said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS' think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific precision – the way that mercactians have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing bands in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions raised related to their level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
'This is a new way of doing research,' says Jamie Bartlett.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are more men, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new inescapable tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, through the "Likes", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the 'data supernova' generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research papers whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's advantage is that it allows you to study people you might not approach on the streets.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.
'Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information. "
Others say that the site could provide a means of identifying and addressing health and social problems.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues, young students who were talking on Facebook about their drunk exploits were far more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that colleagues from students, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly assist a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, says The Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be recognized in another case."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The data-driven site team studied statistics on the Love Situation and Day of St. Valentine's Day, the turnout in the 2010 midterm elections and a national happiness index (thanks to the information only available - the champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make its treasure of data available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not -- in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, there is something else online.
"I don't think a large number of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by looking at his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you're doing in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools you can use.
'Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,' he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhumane": First appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter at his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar in Norway," he explains in front of a courtroom full of 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as organisations that support a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, to speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, denied him talking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All of them participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhumane" said a Utoya survivor to Norwegian TV NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made a little progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked the journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But that does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a parent of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview in cinema this week
After Steve Jobs's death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford – distinguished by technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will be released this week as the first part of a film in major markets is how much this creative spirit understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organizational enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a "disease that suggests that a great idea does 90% of the work...but a huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely was used in Nerds, he stated that the main copies had disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, which was slightly uploaded, is the basis for the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast at the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly excited to outline technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also times when Steve Jobs' perfectionism re-emerges, when he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to speed it up and move on to issues or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is a strangely prescient look on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he sees good or bad about other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something crude and inspiring about the man we're seeing here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
It has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then the netting work.
Here's a quick recap of seven remarkable footage of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"In all these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because they have to be done.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to explain his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - a "standard cost" is often started with a nose-to-no-click and then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant that ensured the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick on the Pope:
Steve Jobs recounts the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phones and make a long distance to telephone.
The device was the subject of many writings beforehand, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT-T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball with different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs says, laughing.
"We were young, and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we ourselves could create something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world. "
We didn't both know much, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell a wonderful lap that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by passing on for Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices went in the laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened.
On his love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's canvassing):
At the age of 12, hunting spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searched for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and made a phone call.
Soon after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode-ray tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was back to HP and started typing programs for this machine.
On innovation improvisation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, as he installed himself to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments... I was shouting at me, pretending that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost 300 dollars. I've had enough, I've come out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for 15 dollars and that was incredibly reliable.
On large companies that are running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's have you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, what after?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [these are the types of people who end up running companies and product staff are sidelined from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product against a bad product - the manual labor required.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They wrested defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them to each other.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste. It's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who were working on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health law as court meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets in camera to address the issue of political discord, namely, whether the opposition to President Obama's law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event was taking place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health-care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5.30 a.m. is expected next March, and the result is likely to be conducive to the destabilisation of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer who will be in court and who will argue about the rejection of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and declared opponent of the health law, was there.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising of organizations related to the law and others although the judge cannot be a speaker, guest of honour, or on the programme of such an event".
However, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the case's law firms, as well as a company with massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges drank and dried and collecting gala funds with lawyers who had cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in fund-raising of this event dismantles any claims of impartiality, and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they mix court affairs too easily with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative high-profile activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Solicitor General of Obama’s administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
Her critics lobbied for Kagan to recuse himself from hearing the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would do so.
Boeing records record order of 18 billion dollars for airliners
Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-aisle airliners, with the possibility to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a whole affair when the airline in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Just as incredible is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released on Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft with a total value of 450 billion dollars over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing informed the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisles.
The Dubai-based Emirates airline placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, which would raise the total order to 26 billion dollars.
On the other hand, Boeing reported on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger amenities.
The amount of these six aircraft is more than a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have the means not only to pay these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to the airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them, since the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is important as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
'They have natural hazard cover,' he said.
The Emirates command reinforces Boeing's predominance in the wide-body aircraft market and helps to curb the attempt to encroach on the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics Fair came four months after Airbus announced the debut of the largest version of the A350, which rivalled the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing its debut to increase the push from its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to 67.94 dollars.
Mexican President's sister obviously defeated in Michoacan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that the drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governorship race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to become a governor of Michoacan in violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for Governor of that western state.
"The involvement of organised crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview on the Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They took the polls, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out from just a few Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential election for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive against the traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacan elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign-debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Managing Director of BASD based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent" eye and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
'Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,' he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the eurozone has been seriously shaken by a sovereign-debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has soared and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The thriving sovereign debt crisis in Europe has caused the fear that the global economy will go into recession, and has prompted the appeal of the major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag warned that the IMF would channel all Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance – such as buying the bonds of the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility – offered greater bargaining power to Europe’s Asian partners.
India's Minister of Trade and Industry, Anand Sharma, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area, given that its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and drying up foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We have monumental challenges ahead and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans when they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to get Europe's 1.2 billion indulging in aid, at least 800,000 of whom live on two or fewer dollars a day.
'One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow it,' he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The BASD forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces "loss risks" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "devey plans" to protect themselves from economic turnaround and significant capital flight.
Serious Pentagon warnings about potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta stepped up pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. It triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields and civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already digesting 450 billion dollars in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional 600 dollars or more cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a fiscal agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would lead to 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, thus applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or ship - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta writes to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and would seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although wartime financing of contingency transactions abroad is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war."
"Wages management staff would be reduced, leading to late payments to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed global leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves".
"Sketapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to occur."
That Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings increase the pressure for a fiscal compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, even though he himself has reached the highest Pentagon post with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he is faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen – a soldier with a shell, but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a fighter plane, with no enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries."
"De facto, it invites aggression..."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: the time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk to future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could switch to the tile, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate savings of 80 billion dollars over 10 years, but its proponents say it is a key step in improving and responding to the potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how pervasive deception and lie are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convintendents from countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner passed to an idiot by quickly issuing contradicts by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violating funding for campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then none of the one who lived through the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying in his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The cheating narratives of the school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test responses to students in order to be seen clearly on their performance assessments.
Menrs who should teach otherwise send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
Over a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners are lying three times within the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim: 'I have had you', detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars look you in the eye.
They do not stammer, blushe or always agitate.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can uncover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the facial microexpressions, the formation of the question and the response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and still emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are adept at reading others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies 'centric about them' while women say more lies 'centric about others' - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people less often lie to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they say tend to be enormous).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if anyone is lying?
First of all, look at the normal behavior of your subject.
This is known as the "setting the reference data".
This helps to provide a baseline for measuring subsequent changes.
Look at the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves their feet all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when you see them moving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal, non-verbal deceptive behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards a exit, significantly change their posture or present relief from "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions are over.
Interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson slipped using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a language that has been out of place: "I haven't had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a hard question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden tongue" in their answer to a difficult question: "Well... to say the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimisation by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after Obama’s administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico – sparking union anger while easing environmentalists – the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, claims that the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real way forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed its support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the Province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
To that end, it would have to cross six States.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are pressing a force for a law to forcibly remove the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing Department of State environmental impact assessment found that the project would pose only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Ministry's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit with fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, who was thrown into a violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their granddaughter to the point where she vomited with fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, to such an extent that she suffered "difference changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk picked up the car, Monk got off in the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk stated that she stopped near the door and laid down her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to fetch her," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She told me in an aggressive tone: 'You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door,' said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'I'm not interested in what you say or think'.
She became enraged and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,' said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held back by her entourage who trained her towards a car that was waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, stated that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family planned to donate all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
'The aim is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct,' said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has held back the economy
In the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted
2011 is a year to be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history, the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdez, who was self-remembered for change, which has generated high expectations for the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillion toll-win losses for the agricultural sector, limited the Government's growth economy's potential, caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on assignments by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the State unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year there was an accelerated increase, for while from January to March 55 000 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economic Population Activated,6.19 per cent, a rate of more than 74 thousand unemployed sinaloisens, an increase from the first half of the first half of 18,969.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactor, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource restriction by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally, it is not easy for them to work to earn them, invest them and use them in something," he says.
Detained migration
Mr. Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who drop out of the state to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the entry difficulties and secondly because when they get in their entry already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment is rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the sinaloen labour market is worsening by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, the 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing to any social insurance institution as a worker.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of seriousness, another reason for the state's gap is the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Insurance Institute and the Secretariat for Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloen workers was, until September, 5,000,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,775 pesos.
FDI contract
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in foreign investment direct in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the State FDI reached .630,697, a decrease of 87.74 per cent from the 5.14 million 3,000 1,000,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the service sector.
Debt
In view of the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested the public Congress in July to approve a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the objective of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2.6 trillion pesos and until November no debt benefit was observed in any sector.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, which was included in the State Government.
"The return on Sinaloa's economy this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align everyone's effort and above all the already synchronized good progress of this new government team, let us hope that next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo Lopez stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year retained the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
'The low economic flux is produced by several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy which does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism which makes it possible to have an acceptable level and flows in the trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing a lot below the expectations we had,' he says.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that the State is to be channeled into productive activities of more dynamism.
'In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources are detonated,' he says.
Much to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for a future that better channelled the Government's efforts.
'In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are a few advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,' he said.
He pointed out that the current administration had shown advances in the management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much has been done and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still a lot to be done," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marihuana
One person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years'imprisonment and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marihuana.
The Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant possession of marihuana intended for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I case file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was travelling in a white pick-up truck in which he was carrying a black bag in the luggage rack of the vehicle and in the co-pilot's square a small backpack where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Implementation of Legal Consequences of the Offences.
Debts to contributions to books
Social work, contemplated in programmes such as H-bitat, Rescate de Espacios Pafficos and 3x1 para migrants, may not be finished where there are serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development has indicated that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk, as the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that, in total, the investment of those three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State had to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municip had provided resources for the works, and therefore there was a possibility of a delay in their finalization.
'They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to finish they have not given us anything, even if since July they have had to give us a part of it,' he says, 'and we, for we, for no delays, we have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money'.
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, and therefore at the beginning of the administration Municipe had to request an appropriation to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already experienced this in the previous period of September because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to work and this year we, to be able to access these programmes, we have had the resources to cover what the state had not paid for," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have not given us anything."
Court validates "analog cut-off" in Mexico in 2015
Substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the largest foreign exchange that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of National Justice (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree, which put forward the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not met.
A minority of four ministers, who were the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his remit when issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been dismissed for not having reached a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is a statutory award to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
The draft voted only by the vote, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers also resolved the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the draft for which Minister Sanchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure the measures by means of the public administration to prepare for them.
"I also consider that if it did so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, whose constitutional mandate is the management of the State.
The substitution of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years and this translates into better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Deferring change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalisation, which involves a public interest decision that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the power of the executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries in all countries had already completed the digital transition and had done so through the executive, despite the fact that they had the specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress in a form, since it ensures in the administrative sphere respects the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
An analysis is the possibility of a vote-by-vote by vote in Michoacon
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacan, where, according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 679 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacan (IEM), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal, recalled that a few days ago, the electoral body was approved by the electoral body for harmonizing local standards to the federal reform of electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacan did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the completion of the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time-limits provided by the Official Journal of the State.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by local Legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms, as he has no right to "sanction or contest them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal stated that, thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of EMP it will be possible to produce the partial and total statements of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of the ballot and count in the file of the ballot box is not found in the case of the urn's president; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all election ballot boxes may be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate assumed to win the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the ballot is equal to or below one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition who submitted the second of the candidates.
The total counting of the ballot may also be taken if, at the end of the common count, it follows that the difference between the candidate assumed to be second and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has emerged second, in which the electoral packages which have been subject to the partial count shall be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra de zapalamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday tonight, and on Monday people will pay their tributes and there will be a requieming.
According to his family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be spread in the Sierra de zapalamé.
After receiving tributes to the other persons dying in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the side of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest of the following the following family attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.

"He wanted to return to Saltillo and his ashes were spread in the Sierra de zapalamé, he always said that this is his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was an extraordinary father and son, an affectionate brother and care for a lot of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the city of Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he was even in a truck ache; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio recalled that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion on which he brought Martha Sahaagon to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was seven years old he traveled to zapopan for the graduation of his parent, for which he knows that his uncle is dies in doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours goodbye was said to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute to which Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, presented by the people and the State Government, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, was studied in 1985 as the Mexican Air Force, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Social Institute.
Bacio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he was flying crashed, beside the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six people, all officials of the service.

Three abandoned bodies, located on the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had brought to the media the media to 11 persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot with gunshots and grace, in an abandoned property of the municipe of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the beige color and coffee the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, at approximately three metres, they located the three-person bodies, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to it there was another with a white T-shirt, with shoulder straps.
At one metre distance there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to in situ data, the three persons had been murdered in another place, as no in situ casings were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one group of organized crime to the other, apart from a few ball openings in the latter and in the gate.
11 captured at Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the Cadereyta municipe and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first fact on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement, eight people were arrested and rescued from one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated from three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los zetas".
In another event, which took place on 12 November at 6 p.m., military personnel travelled on surveillance to Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car without a licence plate with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and carrying out an inspection, the soldiers found a long weapon, a magazine and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are given clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Teron, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government to be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to bear the brink of economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone in jeopardy.
A presidential palace statement announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he could form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive assumes his job.
Monti said that he would present to the president the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase", said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The 'frame is now well drawn,' he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, as Italy was fighting a political and financial crisis that pushed the costs of its debt to unsupported levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By pointing to the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of markets has placed the yield on Italian construction bonds at 10 years above the 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have been saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: 'We said that we would support this government a lot'.
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed Monti's technocratic majority government.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches has added to the pressure, observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups on Monday and youth and women's organisations.
He will finish his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who empowered an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italy’s debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 trillion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give it time to implement the reforms before putting the elections forward.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that he should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited participants participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, compared the 22 conversions of today's friendly at 15:05 at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA's monthly ranking, count a large register of class A-class inter-selected games, the Hacolor only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star League and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity in national league and cup league championships and disputes in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated European Cup and World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have an area-limited international experience, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (Defence 0–1 in London) equalled former goalkeeper Andoni zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Hacroe today and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernandez, the cerebral flywheel of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the above-mentioned 126-mentioned and the fore-centre of the Schalke, Rael Gonzalez, with 102.
Centennial loan is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fébregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From Costa Rica, and near Michael Umana are the left lateral Janior D'az, with 48 attendances and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five had more than 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The least.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Rael Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 attendances, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica's only one, and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet make a start.
The historical striker of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday on National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group says that for them it will also be a dream come true of that country.
This is because bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil last week.
The band is on the South American wing of its two-time work-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day will appear on the National Stadium, starting at 7.30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles Group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nacion on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are going through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent the holidays in Costa Rica only once; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it's an emotion for us to wear our music there.
I ask you, because there's a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live intensely in the days before.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying behind us all these years.
It took us 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry for the fact that so much time has had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the bigger shows we've offered in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really very eager to do it.
We love this country, we like to surf and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surfboard; that's how we learned, through gentmen who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we never did there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we'll try to perform two songs on each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is the matter?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we love these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it's also becoming more interesting for people.
With this tour, you're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us thought we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue making music together is very emotional.
We love each other and we love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world that we've always wanted to go to.
Things could not get better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We're very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to form part of this Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours is holding together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much more time than many groups normally last.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that wouldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we're famous and a rock star, which is not really of interest to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There's been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and most important is the fact that we're still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song where I see a picture I think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it's always been a pleasure to talk about music.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It's true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the group we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and that has to be very entertaining.
What are you always changing Yello Ledbetter's lyrics live?
This one is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It is he who sings it and I believe he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge up undercover despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think all of us feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the ones that came up at the same time and, if it's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music than ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it became more positive.
What is the need for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe called very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think we can also be happy and even so you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital for being evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the magpies, his family doctor informed.
Fujimori, a 72-year-old man who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including a language cancer for which he has been operated on four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, stated for Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the surrender of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
He was operated on four times with tongue cancer, he had a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving prison in the National Police Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years'imprisonment for the death of 25 people on an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and to discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political and trade authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguay residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "propique for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French proxy, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of his ambassador from that European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of emerging and stronger developed countries around the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to send the financial exchange agreements to leave the "grai list" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is integrated by countries which do not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (LC) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustached plumber switches to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, indefatigable, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the youngster's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which this month comes to everyone's stores, was designed from the beginning to make good use of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows three-dimensional play without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who must say stereoscopy without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press official in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this medium", as until now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Selda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez claimed that "Great Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang on less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to do a "second round" at the levels of play, which this time is more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "cannot succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario into the three dimensions also assumes the character's return to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these Nintendo video games winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the musted plumber has to browse through path-mining platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the 70 million US dollar laundering conspiracy.
This ends with the trial in order to respond to the request of the northern country, which was calling for Portillo to try it to try it.
At a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given rise to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquon will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done presupposes an executive effort after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former proxy of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving its legal situation in Guatemala City and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long century-old jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The birthday was used yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the goal of helping people who are poorly trained, without work, with drug addiction or marginalized problems.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of officials from entities and institutions who in those 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, has shown the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, witnessed the act former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and former deputy mayor to the mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and the Family, Josep Lluas Cleries and the Director-General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, attended also in the Great Hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
'The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,' he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-easts, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the building's 13 apartments, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes number 51 were living was over.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they illegally occupied at noon yesterday and where they were organizing desperate micro-festations that despaired neighbours, in the judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
'From today there will be access control,' said the administrator.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - carried away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially the boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the mass festival scene, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business had fallen by an 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the property invaders made him unfair skill, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure area had had to respond to the neighbours'noiscating complaints about noise, while, according to the latter, the troubles were not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the festivals there, who were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbours of the area.
The discotheque manager explained that the troubles were so great that she even ended up with an agreement with the owner of the building and it was nine months since he "forgive" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernandez Daaz, had asked last week for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of living together and civics caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there have been flights as well.
It was in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be implacable against the anti-social behaviour generated in property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 a.m. the police moved to 35 rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four persons were entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the advisability of summoning beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16-door opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in the midst of the already-extinct Offline Corporation Métropolitaine de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that is not oriented on the north-south, if not high (mountain) - bottom (sea) axis.
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all the access roads to Collserola.
A door puts the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question is alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation and in terms of reflection on the city, is a theme of conversation among all the architects in Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this former elected caste talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three Barcelona architects, university professors, who have presented themselves there coincide.
Miguel Roldon, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
After addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, the speech of green house pier was not brought to an end.
"It is necessary from the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict, the architect for whom the title of "Placerola doors" contained a "lexic trap": we should not think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which one must act".
Modol, like Roldon and Bayona with experience in the urban planning world, called the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
Perils that arise from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience of the 1980s and which had in the Forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the delimitation of the boundaries on which it is possible to construct.
'Limiting something means already establishing the next step,' that is, its overtaking.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) - can cause genuine disasters".
In keeping more on the question, Modol opine that, by simplifying, the slope of the region of El Valles de Collserola "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola which "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the mayor's offer its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city was the safe driving-evident afforded by architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that we had to create: 'We, the architects, should be just an instrument'.
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition lack a global vision of Collserola: 'These are called 16 cross-cutting competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This has, at least in this case, opted for participation in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors could shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, for an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jon's Larrazobal and this will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of Casino Red granted the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jon's Larrazbal will be released after the legal authority of Casino Red grants him a pardon in the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is following a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jon's allegedly demanded payment for an economic quotte so that the mayor of Monterrey would allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PAN- officer and on 2 September he was arrested and kept under provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Délits Patrimoniaux, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the former Quartier de la capitale de l'Etat.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was issued a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta criminal centre for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On 25 October, a capture order was issued by the Registrar of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jon's, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the legal authority of the Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the local mayor; therefore, he could regain his freedom over the next few hours.
During the legal formalities, the public prosecutor attached to the court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garcia Gomez whether the damage had been recovered and who had been the partner in the gambling company who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
Under case 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jon's Larrazobal, and no claims concerning the lawsuit against him would subsequently be brought; he would not be charged any compensation for the damage or any punishment.
After the hearing of the legal authority of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Spaston was ordered.
The Registrar of the Court, Jorge Yanez, travelled to the prison of the Munich of San Nicholas de los Garza to inform Jon's that he had been legally pardoned and his case file would be closed.
He will also communicate to him the immediate order of liberty that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J.come provides details of the air crash in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven people
The Communications and Transportation Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven persons, lost his life, indicate that the helicopter directly shocked the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J-come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
'The evidence that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage.'
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so the unit met the requirements for transporting staff.
Furthermore, he said that investigations in the impact zone do not result in the appearance of rooms on the ground.
'In one research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact has been structurally present.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a pante of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the Major Presidential State helicopter was running at a cruiser speed and this happened on moving ground ascending ground.
'This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruising functioning at the time of impact,' he says.
During the press conference, the registrant of the SCT, Pérez J-come, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of cloudiness at a low height.
Selected roads:
It is likely that, due to the bulbo conditions, the crew sought a lower area of height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersal of the aircraft's remains suggests that the helicopter has collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the site of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of an explosion type or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,1000,200 feet above the mean sea level, the ground had a slope that has been going from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it may have disarticulated along its path.
The information provides elements that suggest that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the encircled area, around the accident, dispersed parts of the aircraft were not found, which bears the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people; this is supported by specialists in the NPI
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people, called the 'Genetic Obesity of Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will make it possible to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Biochemistry Investigation Unit of the Hospital of the 20th Century National Medical Centre, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been trained.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Investigation and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the population who is or are not entitled to, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the proofs are carried out to minors every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He pointed out that the protocol had begun in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October the activity took place in the Sports Unit of Nezahualc-yolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After achieving the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (southern Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of the investigation and the idea of the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on the World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family inheritance of their illnesses, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or renal impairment.
He detailed that Saturdays will apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (seeking to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez pointed out that this investigation is the result of concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there was an increase in obesity in boys in the case of boys and in the case of girls in the 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there was also a dramatic increase,' stressed the IMSS expert.
He said that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from the others in its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have an Indian-American inheritance of 65 per cent, one 30 per cent European and one five per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics are not allowed to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the full assessment of children, which makes it possible to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
Ila even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, as doctors hand it over to the parents in writing, to whom each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they have to make in order to prevent diseases is explained.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking over short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the greatest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - corn flour pâté wrapped in corn leaf -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The UNAM asphalt would prevent blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yields, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the reports that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Metropolitan Area of México, warned Rafael Herrera Nojera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the bituminous bulb was adequate, the cases could be eliminated.
During his conference A Technology Opinion on blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera suggested that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltene, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malhenes, which together give the pavement its viscoelastic behavior characteristic.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C. its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C. it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible paving stone, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small asphalt-sized and subsequently compacted stones.
Each of the little stones that forms the layer, it signaled, is bathed an asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating forces, the latter allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If modified asphalt were used, they would spread better, opined the chemical ingenuous.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a last layer called the tread layer, made of fine stone, that is to say, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the block that receives and distributes the forces, the tread layer also requires that the latter have an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these considerably affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil becomes wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for the latter to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes blackcurrants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that gets damaged is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Researcher System explained that vehicle loads are another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the block must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow blackcurrants to be repaired easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss in favour of being the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramarez Serna not to obtain the crown of Ms. Colombia.
Valle received his title number 14 from the princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atluntico climbed with the crown and the sceptre, the department already boasts 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one by a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who were near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domonguez Borrea (1949),(1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected as vain Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Visa of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the wreath of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer from Valle's candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I quite believe in literature, I think it's a form of cultivating, definitely I think the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince," it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," it's a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read Irene Nemirovski's book, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burrd of Blood".
First of all, this response did not please because of the term "cologicalization" and, secondly, not to explain in concrete terms how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what's to happen is going on.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The little prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinized that being the favorite, the oyster and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craftsmanship, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the Queen and that's why she did not shine on the stage".
And this was noted in his first bathing suit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though she had seemed self-confident, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of Magdalena's and Atlunico's representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the "Como in Casa" (Like at Home) programme, of the RCN Canal stated that the fact that Melina had been appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who wins most of the prizes during the competition does not receive the crown of queen".
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and this was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why, two days before the election, the international jura Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to her country's social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest is already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculate that Valle sinned by his back flaws and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernon Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which actually for me had not been too famous, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that the mistake of the Valle candidate was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"Surgs are good, but Valle hasn't been able to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest gives for the first time, after the parade in a swimsuit, came a cruel prediction that came to pass last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was doing to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designating the National Competition.
However, it will pass in history as one of the queens who, despite its dazzling passage through Cartagena, has not obtained the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typist of Cali has moved on to the story as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano'.
The work of these officials is crucial.
In November 4 a typist of Cilicopac has passed to the story as the person who confirmed the identity of the False Chief: "Alfonso Cano", by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the local offices of the CTI, this week was the "availability" tour of Eliazar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
Early in his career, Gonzalez worked in the Munich Caps, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after attending suitable courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of the friction skin, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter in Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected that one of them was the one of the man who ran the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Soenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the site, he didn't recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a sampler and a lantern, Eliazar compared the corpse's fingerprints with those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzon, that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a typist from Sijon de Cali, President Juan Manuel Santos's recognition of Eliazar Gonzalez in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Plasyloscopy is an exact, no-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-g
Apart from identifying the bodies, the typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told that in one flight he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
'The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the imprint with all the hand and identify the offender who had been involved in different flights,' he recalls.
The fingerprints may also dismiss or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
The investigation was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and indeed a mark on the bottle coincided.
Even if it does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it places him on the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprinting explained that "final fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a sampler or a strip is used to take them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the Declining Database, or to the National Civil Registry.
'The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,' the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is how the CSI television programme is shown.
As not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched necessarily becomes a imprint.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is realized.
The "indiggers" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were jostling in front of the square in zuccotti to camp.
A large proportion of the persons became eligible for evacuation and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street members defied the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a judicial order, in Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of demonstrators were jostling in front of the square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allowed the 'indignant' to camp again in this area, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to move to another place and we'll continue the legal struggle to return to zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'indignant' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the area, but after the police moved around and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are centenarians of people who had settled in this area, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support to members of the movement and tried to intervene on behalf of the police.
In the meantime, the square - which is a privately owned forum - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of this morning must be analysed.
Some displaced demonstrators were carrying and distributing at that time copies of the judicial order and even handed it over to the officers who were monitoring the square, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from regaining access to the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and demonstrators, but he alerted that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the 'drib' evacuation at the zuccotti square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were 'stopping the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became "a place in which people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases, to harm others", because "some shops had received threats" and the residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," added the movement's spokesman, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
Officials of "Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they do not intend to organise "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organisations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas television program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Andonson, next to the "banoner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 performing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the drummer of "Mutley Cree", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a nursery a doll that depicted Jesus in a nursery.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian-born Canadian comedian who recently introduced a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears to be Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Noel program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not himself far from the controversies.
Recently, Bublé called 'put' Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan is back after the earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% through domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, Japan’s economy has been paralysed, still convalescent after the devastating nuclear-crisis earthquake, the worst disaster in the Japanese country since World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo Government have calculated the material losses at USD 300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualised rates.
The second quarter recorded - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the largest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery was partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that calls for the crisis to consolidate – or rebuild – infrastructure, use the gaps to grow zero.
Japan has woken up mainly due to changes in domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased a 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “safe havens” elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the US state’s turmoil, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of economic floating is determined by the health of the major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed the yen's fee for their poor performance between July and September.
While markets continue to serve in the EU's outlying countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is not on guard.
"We must monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the outlook is not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries had given clearer signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates points of inflection in the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
This one fell to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below average, which is in level 100, n dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens is again fuelling doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk presumes triggered and uncertainty re-established in the parks, Greece continues to bend in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional Government is imposed rather by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reform and that the 100-day period established in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, was making sure that he was not going to support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for the planned new election.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit", said Papadimos when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday, which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the Civil Servants' Disciplinary Code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras no points to doubts about his position: 'We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything more'.
The conservative leader has gone no further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the bodies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letters of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of Papandreu's back-to-back referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenes parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a long way to go.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "pre-representative" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-class place in the role of microfinance".
In the last two decades, Queen Sofa recalled that the country has become the second largest donor of the planet in the last two decades with regard to this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the V-e World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the goal of reducing the volume of people who live on income in one dollar a day, to which the "poverty" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and above all for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have 'achieved a lot of goals' and 'we are facing a lot of challenges'.
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform on which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
For example, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that 100 million of these families will leave the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known for 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous development", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday gave him the qualifier of "leader of family" meeting in Valladolid by the "Bank of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sofa finished her intervention by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Efactive etiquette"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, has warned that solidarity "is a metric imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to win cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as this is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez considered that micro-credits presupposed "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever", the governments of the developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro-credit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to "exclusive" people who are closing the door to; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors with a spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without any difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel was entitled, at the end of their speeches, and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schauble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The mainstay of the Chancellor - and of the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis 'is not less Europe but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe is peace but because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
For the Chancellor, 'the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe'.
This could result in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, the infamous of which is clearly Wolfgang Schauble.
To be sure, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Sept will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it, and the CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh each country's weight on the European Central Bank's Executive Board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously meant strengthening Germany's weight.
Wanting to ease the climate within her party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who are quick to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel did not raise France.
Except in hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is sick arrest fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and to deliver a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is based on a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a source of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
Firstly, with the aim of saving budgetary: the government is considering imposing on private employees a fourth day of waiting before taking care of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' salary, i.e. at least 15% of his or her monthly income.
A measure that risks giving rise to anger, but which would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic significance: to impose on civil servants a day of uncompensated deficiency in the event of a stoppage of work (they have so far not have a waiting period for failure to fail, compared with three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunches the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls are going to be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will repay," Xavier Bertrand warned at RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the announcement effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensive since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us dwell on the national figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than Euro237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, in 2008 daily allowances accounted for 5 per cent of health expenditure, at Euro11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were maternity and work-related leave, and 54% were sick leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said that they had not taken any sick leave.
Another study, this time of sickness insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to stoppages of work.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health and non-health reasons) fluctuated between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick-outline fraud accounts for very little in the face of undeclared work.
As for fraud, it is only small.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that the checks on sick leave are systematic for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 completed for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", or 33,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled arrests of more than 45 days, there were 11% of "unsuitable or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, as a result, 169 000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had had sick leave.
This figure is very little, for example, in the figure of undeclared work.
According to Mr UMP, Mr Dominique Tian, who had a report on the issue in June, it would amount to EUR 9 to 15 billion of tax losses per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece to have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to rebuild its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said to Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme", said the Head of Government, who was delivering his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Mr. Papademos predicted that the country's general government deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having stood at 10.6% in 2010 and by 15.7% in 2009.
Right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to emerge from the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures", he said at a meeting with his party's members, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health-care institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for doing so.
This was one of the findings of a massive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient who is deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them die in hospital.
Overall, in the country, Quebec has the highest rate, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report came to conclusions that contradict the position of the federal government, which had already said that they did not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on competent or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, said yesterday in teleconference, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, there are more cases of these spillovers precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It should be recalled that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of older people or people with disabilities are of less value.
As for persons who had committed assisted suicide, the respondents considered that they should not be prosecuted for 41 per cent.
When it comes to maintaining or quitting care with a patient, the situation is less clear, say the report.
Therefore, in the list of recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health-care institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee calls for consideration, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report, among others, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ills.
'This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 could ask for help in committing suicide,' says Mr Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values that contribute to the social fabric of society.
Now, 'in society,' he says, 'there are beacons and constraints'.
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia protest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan King calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bashar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a 'conspiracy' against the country.
Two days after Syria was suspended by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces were killed again.
"If Bashar was interested in his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, a neighbor of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu deplored the failure of Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is adopting an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthevious of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime", after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of regime forces died in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians perished "when shooting and shelling heavy machine guns" in the besieged town of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria will "did not to hang down", he added, assuring that "the plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said was locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is planned tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the protested cities and the release of the demonstrators arrested.
Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday called the Arab League’s decision “uncorrect,” as China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while failing to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and implement a programme, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before meeting trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important programme with many sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, a Member of Parliament from one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President of the Council-designate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to call for a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a shortlist, arguably from a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In 'democracy, there are precise deadlines' for preparing a government and its programme, he stressed, saying to himself 'some that the markets will be patient and will understand'.
Its appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern picked up, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should set up a team of mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to run until 2013, when the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr. Monti has committed himself, once taking office, to work in the emergency and for the aim of Italy 'recoming protagonist' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its balanced budget target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called in particular for new austerity measures.
The Italian "pattern of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the 'professor' symbolising 'the challenge of seriousness' and 'another Italy', according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy must place EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon detonator, an atomic risk NGO said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about an "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS drawing heavily from IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Oral), and was allegedly involved in the explosion-based synthetic diamond factory.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company reportedly led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only familiar with this technique, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of its career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes have increased by 50 per cent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slightly, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disrupting to see these crimes and misdemeanours increase again", stressed the human rights organisation Human rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", the organisation added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre's leaders.
"The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he adds, believing that this could involve an improvement in police reports on 'hate crimes'.
The "hate crime" in US federal law is a legacy of the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now gender.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live, the activity of the other "Twittos", the users whose messages ("tweets") and those who follow you are being followed.
This makes it possible to know whether they are forwarding with messages, whether they subscribe to new accounts, whether they have favourite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known to work uninstinctively, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast someone else's message, 'followfriday' to recommend following another user) making the happiness of insiders, thus opening up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the large-scale public networks Facebook and Google.
On the network, users debated by slices of "tweets" about the value of this innovation.
"It's useless, intrusive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes 'jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed," sent 'dannykronstrom.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of the grand social-democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to enshrine in the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision following a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's creditworthiness were to be reduced by a single notch, from AAA to AA, we would have to pay an additional EUR 3 billion in interest every year," argued Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request for a summit in Brussels in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value.
The mechanism adopted by the Austrian Government is moving closer to the 'German model', as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decline by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal state's structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets at equilibrium.
The aim is to increase public debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back close to the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen massively against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of vigour since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has since recently returned, boosted by purchases by investors who see it as a “safe haven” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic threshold of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This spike in the Japanese currency undermines exports from the archipelago because it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign-export income by Japanese firms, when converting it into national currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild" since the 11 March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda fears that this price of the yen would kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households with the disaster.
But the Prime Minister said that the high cost of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” implying that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion), raising the ceiling of the amounts it spends on buying various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros).
Euro area:
Rates rise, stock markets falters
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the vulnerable countries continue to rise.
Always concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock markets are sinking a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% at 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt cedes 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions on the yields of the euro area countries in difficulty, equities markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are all too aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, suffering from renewed market leaders' fears about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a focus on Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations until investors have evidence that the situation is being stabilised," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the eurozone’s future is penalizing the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At about 10 a.m., the European currency is worth 1.357 dollars, in decline by 0.4%.
According to brokers, it receded after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, passed a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian bonds at 10 years reached 6.85%, and that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has called for time for the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with asphyxiation by the burden of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while parliamentary elections in the country are held on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Pending growth figures in the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised the second quarter's figure downwards, with a decline of 0.1 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it's really the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term or emotional considerations, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy for an electoral meeting to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place where nuclear power is.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts and rational data.
With 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its own subject to the need to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only state-of-the-art power stations.
In contrast, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their plans with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its fleet by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German renewable energy model is sometimes presented as an example, reality frustrates speech.
Berlin's choice will lead to higher electricity prices, an energy dependency compounded by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a surge in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal-fired power plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
A European wind champion, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittence of the wind; by virtue of which its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the good declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show this.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs.
Strongly exporting, it drives a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and makes them very creative in non-delocalizers.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual EUR 6 billion of exports of French nuclear equipment and services as a waste of straits.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle power generation, nor is there any diabolical.
Areva's development of low-transmitting solutions for CO2, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We in France have a security authority which exercises intransigent and transparent control over existing plants and on the Flamanville shipyard.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, acted under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German security authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR has a concept of making it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians willing to build a power plant, the halting of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them a clear way to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate a debate that is so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various angles - the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's 'human rights country'.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment to which foreign students were subjected, the Minister of the Interior (liberation of 23 May) stating that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic perspective.
It is because there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both the left and the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, indicating that co-development will make it possible to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be an election-payable; but it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among scholars on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration anaemia growth and hinders employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace national workers, especially the low-skilled, who exerted downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly in occupations in sectors with a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country that is experiencing a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of the nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity provided by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, with an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 in Germany will make a net contribution (less expenditure income) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his mandate, to look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, by serving to deter immigrants, were the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, Europe's democracy is still to be thought
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember it, which, in order to have invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that it would be sufficient for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote and to exercise it in the most direct manner.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an easy way of thinking.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even be made 'instrument of oppression', as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, a separation and a control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palined of the true Greek referendum has been worth a double revealing point in this respect: that of the need for a powerful return to politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be out of date.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and that, for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer pulling in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in a fragmented order.
A white-sewing to the European absolute monarch or a jumping on foot in the vacuum of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen.
No, we do not want a tile but a common, straight, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there can be no more to stop the listing - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is blaming itself for the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the management of the European project to popular sovereignty.
For it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After a long time fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for the European economic government.
Let's be.
But thinking it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the construction of Europe.
To do the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" republicans.
The Revolution in the Interest could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are generalized
The world smart card fair opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, telephone with SIM card, etc.), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is contactless technology, which allows public transport to be paid for or pay for purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year ago.
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for almost 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But large areas put the double bites.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard cards this year.
To move up a gear, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two large French institutions have committed themselves to systematically distributing bank cards to their customers in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out transactions.
"They were late."
"But they should finally have a real boom next year."
"We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Crédit Agricos announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a contactless payment case.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société générale, too, said yesterday to prepare an offer to market that allows its customers to pay contactlessly with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qa'idah in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-suspected, the links between the al-Qa'idah terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
'The way the two organisations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation,' he explained without further details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger last January is said to have uncovered the bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day while several of their captors in an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the appeals made is directed towards several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but more formal evidence is probably needed before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has been receiving external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," temper Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher, tempers.
In recent months, these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or in its modus operandi, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices and on the same footing as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of undisputed enlightened people.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist manist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning "Wesatern education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslims in Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is a rapid success.
It politicized itself and demanded strict respect for sharia law, while its militants engaged in the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are aimed primarily at churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
The Abuja reaction is, as usual, unqualified.
The army invaded the city, there were 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect became radicalized and left its northern fiefdoms.
At last Christmas, she claims an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the security headquarters of the police in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now of concern to all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, as the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry competed in simplism and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied thunderous statements and foreign-policy shortcuts, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsubstantiated - shudder.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the Grand Old Party nomination race, threatened to drag the Chinese into the WTO and question them "for manipulation of their currency," a promising theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire swathes of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if that is to involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign-policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flates” emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, displays an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for China’s military threat because Beijing “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964.
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are a long way from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president argue that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the overly hasty departure of the 'boys' from Iraq, on its procrastination in Libya, thus sticking to it a weak label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers Obama’s national security record, which eliminated Bin Laden, rather positive.
Since Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to stalling.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes fairer.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia and moving to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, entered into service.
It has to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with vigour.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday, took part in the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte jointly turned the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe via a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Hopeonia.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, making it possible to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same path.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site has victorious airs.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will make it possible to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to the West European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of weakening the Europe of energy, since the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has, in just five years, managed to achieve its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily consumed by gas, whose fields are in decline.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically", confirmed François Fillon, inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the large smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in large numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-woven steel in order to protect it from ships' anchors.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
In order to build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be kidnapped or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Muller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the number of measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel turns, which nothing interrupts its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project officials gave it up, while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state-owned company permanently sailing off their coasts.
"In the event of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft operating inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres second, he provides precise information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) joined, as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in the city of zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased all gas transmission capacity to the company for 20 years renewable.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Muller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy pine-planted coastline.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
With full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created some 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste for writing.
He has a fragrance of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of an off-white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is based on an old production technique, the mole skin (mole skin) which designates a varnished cotton wool used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moldeskine revived an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine extends beyond the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook appeals to both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early stages, now has almost 100 employees today and has had two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its booksellers in bookshops, from Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose its identity.
"We've followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine's development: recently, the brand has launched an exhibition "During" where architects exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diary, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a range of media.
A success that made it envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of the disabled. "
"The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. "
"However, there is still a lot to be done. "
It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, there are still many obstacles before they can access employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with an average of 38%.
In short, these are all criteria which make it particularly difficult to return to work, and which "past the crux of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, the general manager of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
There remains the unsaid, the attitudes that are changing, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychological or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, dating from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6 per cent.
"We are now around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, Director General of AgeFph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
The proof: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, increasing 59 000 to 46 000 structures (from 606 million to EUR 480 million).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc. "
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday night (8:45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We won't go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Auditorium of the Stadium of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did well make peace.
Five months after his attacker's gesture of humidity against Turkey, the Belgian manager has only a praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to move forward," Lille is assured.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it is a whole," he justified himself.
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to make my mark."
Demaned against Romania on Friday evening in view of this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "brille".
However, it does not omit the concept of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the successful campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
'I've always been a fan,' he says.
Of course, this helps to further strengthen the "individual" nature of this meeting.
"There is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he says.
"We crossed each other just now."
"To be able to play against them is nothing but happiness."
With goodness, Leekens spoke of "firedness".
"Drivier" to play "a gala match".
"Fier" also to note - as a "neighbour" - that France is "returning a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunderous job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well shared the plane with the Blues in the direction of... Brazil in 2014.
'Our little Belgians are getting big,' he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll see it in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal, with many optimists, began its roadblock back to Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way out, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seeing this, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been at the helmet since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to de-pull.
In view of the first leg (0-0), on Friday in the hell of zenica, it is clear that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, but it was unable to score that very valuable goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score an outside goal."
But at home, in their bright Stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be here also boiling, even if the game is obviously "very close", a Bento optimistic but lucid stands.
"We expect a very close game, but we are quite convinced that we can take the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being in Euro 2012", has nevertheless put Latinivated Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The Bosnian draw reported on Friday forced the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score an outside goal," Bento regrets.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in the case of the Portuguese, the Portuguese will have the intention of putting maximum pressure on the Bosniacs to enter so as not to give them time to reflect. "
A good idea, provided it is realistic, this time.
