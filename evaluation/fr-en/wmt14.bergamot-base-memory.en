NSA case highlights total lack of intelligence debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is offended in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and on the other, prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in the light of American power, this is an important insight.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be outraged by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The implementation of technological tools of very powerful interception by the United States, but also by France, for the past ten years, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information that are almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the NSA’s means.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - as has already been said - the Americans can give information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, as the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be their own, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States? a deterioration of its image?
We may denounce them, but I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk faced by the Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies – and recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest peak of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American service providers subject to American laws, and therefore to the control of the NSA.
Last element: the broad movement of revelations initiated by media around the world, which helps to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services hitherto virtually non-existent, could push lawmakers, including the American, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi prime minister in outbreak of violence
The US president was scheduled to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq had its deadliest month in October in five and a half years, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1 600 people were injured.
The UN is even higher with 979 dead and 1 902 injured.
This violence is increasingly deadly despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new flaming while neighboring Syria is in the grip of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after at least 26 people died in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the center of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki’s U.S. talks, which will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end the military engagement in this country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and congressional officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing to him the partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who have come otherwise than with RSCA buses
French police have decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Brussels-noon police zone, Friday.
Belgian RSCA fans who want to go to this Champions League meeting will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to carry out arrests or even police custody," said Marie Verbeke.
Vatican surveys contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive records such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each National Bishops' Conference, with instructions for as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for a major gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to survey the parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the poll on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
The 37-year-old who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy de Surrey school faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Mustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, making threats, carrying a weapon in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
“The prompt reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the security conclusion of this incident,” Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could suppress the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice for life from nicotine addiction.
Further tests are needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated “were calmed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proven to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently so that the antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is rumbling in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of the deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the re-establishment of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says the Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet with him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents in the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial is reproached by a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to have Sisi judged, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20 000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities said on Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and he died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and care for people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28, inclusive," said the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries now call on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1.
"France being rage-free since 2001, this kitten or mother was imported from another country, not unscathed," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last "indigenous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
“Rabies is a fatal disease if left untreated in time,” the ministries recall and is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
the Pont-de-Buis portico dismantled
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the spot shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticos in a state of operation in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Australian woman appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were proficient in her, assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, CCTV recordings later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before they confessed to coining the story.
She was detained in a cell of the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on Canberra’s Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously had a nerve-wracking moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a 50 000 baht bail was paid.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, it was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heightening of the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are facing legal action regarding Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it capped at the post at the patent auction that took place after Nortel went bankrupt.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for 4.5 billion dollars, has filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. Assize Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in relation to Internet search terms, the trial’s findings have indicated, which is Google’s core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900M for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, only to finally offer 4.4 billion dollars.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for an amount of $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in issue during the auction, Google violated and continues to violate the patents,” the trial’s findings said.
Rockstar is seeking more significant damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the plaintiff.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the trade lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a café, after their expiration in August 2005, without a tender.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr.'s secret interest. Obeid in these properties, following the testimony of the former assistant secretary general of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has lobbied for the leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which reported to the Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a bid.
M. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the start of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid who, acknowledged Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, M. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of trade lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. replied. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board airplanes (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airlines passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, and listen to music — but not talk on their mobile phones — under the much-anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated the crew training manuals and the rules for the storage of aircraft to be in compliance.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve a broader use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them back on until the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are expected to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft descends before landing and not turn them back on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground running, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for that – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10 000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online game Scrabble style that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power over mobile phones is part of the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered to be at risk.
“Mobile phones are truly a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because device use has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New airliners depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic and FAA-approved interference.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded an airliner with Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired the members of the FAA Advisory Committee on mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed interference from the aircraft was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with an aircraft’s systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for common-sense arrangements for technology-equipped travellers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US gesture of relaxing electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in “aircraft” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring U.S. carriers to perform significant work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not immediately intend to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in effect in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on an airplane,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulation requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained on a permanent basis and for passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has previously spoken to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we truly believe that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said she is following the current rules for the time being.
“In keeping with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not immediately intend to change that,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will take a close look at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, carry-on baggage programs and passenger instructions.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
CDC publishes advice on child allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies in school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the event of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of the typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like something is stinging my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have tingling on my tongue."
A lot of opposition to medical assistance in dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, held this week in Ottawa, comes days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus were on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatifs du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If he is adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice president of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that Quebec's bill disorients the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end-of-life will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Halloween 2013 : In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today I became more pinger.
For the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I certainly will not do it more this year.
But stats show I'm the scabby sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them will actually celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
Costumes are expected to be 1.2 billion dollars out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are all the rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men in Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my amazement, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330M on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't glindle.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This is about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go on a candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy and, do not tell stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; and yet almost 16 million kg is sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
This is a mystery that I have not yet succeeded in clarifying.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1 200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500M in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these great photos of you pissing on you that your friends put on Facebook and that you can not remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the style "pretty head".
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and to carve a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby-cycrote trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that gently wither on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get noticed more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) has charged a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students receiving two-residential school transportation, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the SIRC was invited to mediation and requested additional time to consider it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to consult and find solutions," says Ms. Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (SSRC) did not comment.

DRC: Army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The irreducible M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at nearly 2000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba, who was reached by phone around 12h30, told AFP, and according to whom a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has diminished a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have repelled the rebels a little bit."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "raking operation".
There were clearly heard behind him crackling of small arms.
From Bunagana, a political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the UN Stabilization Mission of the DRC, the fighting entered "a final phase", the FARDC having "encircled the positions of the residual M23 to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, MONUSCO has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it has provided government troops with decisive intelligence, observation and planning support.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, climbed towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Uganda-side border crossing Bunagana, soldiers with the help of civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to ensure the succession of another craft plundering the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday night called on rebels to "willfully demobilize" on pain of being disarmed "by force", but has left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been talking since December without result for the moment.
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it remains only for Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which is denied by Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed to go to our fields, but the military told us to withdraw," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
We have the impression that the shootings are approaching the population.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their head, to spend the night in Uganda.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas Palestinian Islamist militant on Thursday and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, health services sources said.
A Hamas-based source explained that fighting broke out in the area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army has merely referred to "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as "terrorist" by the Israeli state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in October.
Security concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, rooming them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Worried about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt marked "we want safety" in Portuguese before joining the crowd on the Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-governed Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than US$50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames the Renamo for unleashing the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
M. Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that the French news agency. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the worry grew after Mr. Mazanga said that the Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favor of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of the vote won by Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
M. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to step down at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” he said. Mazanga.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North-South highway.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
M. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if the Renamo would reiterate this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has heightened the government’s frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that those responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only want stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a gathering of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was hectic on the side of Pia where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries are reported to be deplored.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who was caring for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor officiated, says he is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released on conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and do not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
Coulson used the phone hack to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a bogus pipe on a link involving the then-practising Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "pretty special counselor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper instructed Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently plant outside his door", but Coulson also called her and left her with voice messages.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people’s homes hoping to surprise them, he’s the kind of man to love presenting the story to people to see what they say about it,” said Mr. Edis.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate the topics: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Does he know of phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say “Of course that he does.”
Rumors about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles. »
A tape, on which were recorded pirated voicemails on his phone on at least three occasions, was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that involved Miss Pawlby and her sister stored in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Miss Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, Mr. added. Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Miss Pawlby's every move.
In a voicemail he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about. »
M. Edis explained that Coulson’s involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defenders Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having done phone hacking.
$325M rescue plan for Tasmania’s health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the faltering health care system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by an aging population in the island state, the high rate of chronic disease and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned over 4 years, was decided after consultations with independent Tasmania MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325M plan includes a $31M campaign for non-emergency surgery.
2 600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help catch up.
Funds are also provided for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical executives, mental health services, and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania’s health care system,” said Plibersek.
The minister said that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The government will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides the services in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
M. Wilkie said today that the US$325 million will not matter for much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
He nevertheless congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent help it presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will go a long way towards removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But health opposition critic Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “fortune solution.”
“The reason we are here is that the state’s Labour government has removed US$430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
We can't have a state government that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 million dollars, and pretends it's a good day.
M. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout was spent on additional bureaucracy.
It walks through the mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect the "CNN Hero of the Year."
This person will receive $250 000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma whose after-effects he was going to wear the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he would get any treatment he could get.
“It’s not easy,” Mr. adds. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., rush to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor per 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 physician for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have practiced more than 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he has created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas over the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32 000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile up in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as a hero: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We get 500 people on each visit,” Mr. said. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this homeless hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected, or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a grueling rhythm, but the musicians of the villages generally help the team to stay motivated.
“They hit drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Mr. explained. Bwelle.
On Sundays, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian physicians and medical students, has performed 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
A man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“This will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to supporting this itinerant hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join M. Bwelle in his missions, it's a learning opportunity in the field that they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help sponge blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second year medical student.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transport and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to die out.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieve pain are the reasons why I do this.

In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The Two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but highlighting its weakness for the crossroads, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair occupied by Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Certainly still, but knowing that such a coronation cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has happened.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and unifying of their works, but pointing out that he was reluctant to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of "Places of memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages could see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a sharp glance and a weight of scholarship, but incurably diletating.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who was not writing had written much and well.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
However, it is, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, the jubilation blown up as with joined feet from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the fleamer back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constituent node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is a concern of the time.
Here few, we have been collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora hunts is quite different.
He does not pose as heirs to an eternal frankness, he refuses to define himself.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented with irritating questions.
Of which it, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its borders, so formerly framed and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, only to ward off the trouble born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits the national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; anxious on the contrary to find its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility that it had cut off the head to the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing beats the four steps out of France, so that the American getaway of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But American cousinage only better emphasizes what is our own.
There, men who had left their Ancien Régime in England and no longer had to care.
Here, men cluttered with an indigenous Ancien Régime, and all the more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when here it has sown the drama and confit.
There founding fathers always honored, and here revolutionary ancestors whose models are difficult to make, and who have moreover killed each other.
There is an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to catch up and tries to resume.
France that is leaving, France coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could stitch the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this Third Republic, a central moment and creator, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and by offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only for a while.
Here she is again in debate, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that is leaving and the circumspect sketch of France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We discover that the shell was a house.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge prunner stood in the center of the center.
And he who had deposited, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have ended up doing it.
Certainly in a less steep, more exploded and more subtle form.
But make no mistake, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to verify the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this craze for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 and France alone, the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms authorized 774 fingerprint recognition systems, hand shape or venous hand network in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
“For example, some people who work concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible,” says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we can not capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted over the past twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increase in sensor accuracy and computing capacity of computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or a moving iris.
“Today, we’re conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a silent environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at the Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the one they claim to be).
The identification until now concerned the issuance of identity documents: it is necessary to confront the biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) with the information that the State has on all the citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not try to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a shop.
“We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet,” says Dany Nassif, head of business development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a picture of a quidam who queues in a store, track his progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening of a computer).
More recently, attendance control was added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the friend who points for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the striking of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger in a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the cash register thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But, for lack of extensive studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to worry.
“The progress of facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” predicts Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying carry carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, though in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them down the plane.
The new hand luggage fees are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance and $100 if the travelers only paid once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fee in advance.
“We don’t want to charge that price,” she said.
Airlines began charging the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more space in these compartments.
These fees are a way of ensuring that passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
It is about making Frontier's customers the most loyal understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue may have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know of these fees before they arrive at the door.
Frontier's carry-on baggage fees will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often ruspet about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not receive the baggage fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage fees three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the consultant with airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the fees in addition.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's hand luggage fees were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the unusual carry-on baggage fees imposed by the company.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding process from my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth grinding and a fight bursting at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers boarded at lightning speed."
Frontier also does as Spirit and applies a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who have coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for the drinks in 2008 but went back seven months later after the passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge a carry-on baggage fee when passengers do not directly purchase their ticket from the airline is his latest effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half the loyalty miles to customers who were buying their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the primes by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1 000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his hometown, Denver, but her business is declining and she's losing money.
Revenues fell 9% and its flight capacity declined by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to straighten out Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog’s tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tails further to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved them further to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in a different way in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions. »
Here we tried to see what was happening in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers tracked animals watching movies where other dogs were featured.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films featuring other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going further to the left or right. »
When the animals saw a dog without expression wagging the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deviating mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you repeatedly encounter other dogs and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience. »
The researchers indicate that the findings could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behavioral expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Science, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they were looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs would more easily go to a robot dog when its tail was moving to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious — the opposite of what’s in the Italian study. »
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs that participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google’s signed smart glasses.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear headphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of the education staff, to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between several cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The organization Vision Diversity has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all origins discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are from the stock or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all this,” explains Vision Diversity President Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the New World Institute, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, support for staff in the transformations we live, within the student clientele," he enumerates.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, also sometimes, come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the Scientific Director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“Different educational strategies are the real need,” she said.
The research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
Obama stops wiretapping for the IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop the wiretaps it was playing on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
The move is part of the White House’s attempt to regain control of the NSA’s wiretapping case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned since the scandal began.
When asked about the issue, a U.S. administration official said: “The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance targeting the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the wiretaps at the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved Thursday a tighter control over government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
European stock markets down mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are trading down on Friday at mid-session, leaded by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could unravel its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea spreads among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Futures on Wall Street point to an upward opening of U.S. equities, after two consecutive downturns.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, weighed down by the result-to-result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after having also published results down this morning and announced the creation in-house of a bad bank structure with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press report that AT&T is studying a possible takeover bid.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is well underway, as evidenced by John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s unique mandate has always been inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential to reduce the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its decline against the US currency and has reached a two-week low at US$1.3517 in session.
These same conjectures, on the other hand, support the euro area bond market.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation passed in July in this state and largely challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five synètes imagined and performed by artists of the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now fills the room at the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a benefit activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without delivering precise figures, the president of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step that we will take in seven years," said the director.
"I would even say beyond that," added Hélène Gaudreault, managing director, smiling.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would hunt down M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears about to be beaten after being driven out of localities in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
“We will pursue the M23 and corner it wherever it is hiding because they are criminals,” FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize themselves because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel’s political leader, said on RFI that the military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality at the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of MONUSCO’s peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was reworked and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” Congolese business expert Jason Stearns told his Congo Siasa blog.
This would be historic - this would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in beating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, which was initially made up of former Congolese military personnel.
British Foreign Minister William Hague has called on Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation following shells in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the residents of Bunagana invaded the streets of the town to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be one day liberated by the army," said a resident of the community bordering Uganda.
“We have lived in terror (M23), we are traumatized,” the man added.
Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage “has gone too far inappropriately”
Kerry said he was softening the U.S.'s defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage "has gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, governed on “autopilot” when a series of inflammatory revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity, from World War II and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course 9/11. »
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately. »
And the President is committed to trying to clarify and make it clear to the people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
M. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up. »
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn about the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorism organizations because of the sense of frustration in the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I will travel to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has picked up millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some U.S. allies, but the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations have reported documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
Intelligence Director James Clapper justified the allies' espionage by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumult atmosphere, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be released in the coming days.
He said the route remained to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, but also to demonstrate “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been applying themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment of U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has had his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for his club's next two Champions League matches against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barca for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three games by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said he was "very disappointed", saying that his appeal was fully justified.
For Titan’s CEO, “Goodyear Amiens’ purchase project starts with zero employees”
After throwing in the towel with crash in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised at the closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumatician Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plan to purchase the plant in January, you're back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this about-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
M. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save some of the highest paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan is buying the closed factory from Goodyear.
From then on, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think M. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from the approximately 1 200 current Goodyear employees.
Also M. Does Montebourg need a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seal a severance benefit agreement for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the factory.
M. Montebourg said you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the plan to purchase the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we give job duration guarantees when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10am local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, there were at least 2 injured.
It is said to be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the fireman.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Supreme Court validates Obama’s health care reform law
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared Obama’s health system reform law to be constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, or have to pay a fine – and said it was constitutional under the government’s tax power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts rallied to the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also approved the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which states that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid must be lowered under penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election running during the 2012 primaries, including nominated candidate Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the soul queen will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board Hall at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Ms. Franklin is busy recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered from, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult".
She said she was "happy to be back."
Children should be taught myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” the author says.
Thor's Legend could show that "brutal force does not weigh in the face of subtle tricks," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "meticulous selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “fit forward completely,” with messages “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight. »
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and that we do not say.
Green light from the United States to the merger Publicis-Omnicom
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objections from U.S. authorities to their merger, approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the world’s second largest agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Group announced today the expiry of the time limit for reviewing the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe et Omnicom, planned by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups said in a statement.
They also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory approvals and approval of shareholders of both groups,” they added.
New class action lawsuit against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at St. Joseph's Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J. J"., who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950's, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the Brother Submissive, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only three institutions, and when the regulations were announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The class action that has just been filed has the particularity of allowing the addition of complainants of any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
Currently, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960's.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of Holy Cross and St. Joseph's Oratory, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless stifled them", and that they "knowingly and consciously ignored"
These last accusations are based among other things on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers Sainte-Croix, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990's, but also by the research made in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage is carried out, namely the hearings on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children are playing on a charred armored vehicle that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on its own.
There will be only the hill of Runyonyi.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
M. Paluku plans to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, some hundred irreducibles of the M23, are entrenched at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby locality of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who reported nearby fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation has been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and were buried.
A girl was shot, and three other people were injured, including one seriously evacuated by FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two warring parties have not given any record of the loss of life.
Court blocks NYPD control and search policy decision
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and divested the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (second circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and the associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday about the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be removed from the case because it violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to criticisms of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by falsely targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
She has appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body-mounted cameras in neighbourhoods where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal lodged by the city should take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and excavation has been around for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that mainly involved black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was instituted in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a class action.
Supporters of changes in the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say the changes are orious to the morale of the police without lowering crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police forces have been sharply reduced in the past decade.
The judge stressed that it did not put an end to the control and search practices, which are constitutional, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, at low altitude.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies to increase international competitiveness or increase profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the turned whistleblower consultant, began unveiling his inexhaustible treasurethaul of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia over state surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence and business services transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that this data will be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the U.S. poses a risk as big as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on trade secrets from foreign companies to U.S. companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“This is not the right way to do this,” said Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock to some companies that previously believed that China posed the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is happening in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members have given up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after the revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction? "
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There have always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, managing director of chemical producing company BASF.
Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, in case this leaves the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is, to say the least, reckless to recover a free USB drive at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of the automaker Audi, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so they can’t be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on their travel abroad because of the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to economic espionage activities by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of having carried out acts of hacking of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. »
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final determination from Mr. Osborne, which in Budget 2012 entered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than £2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to hold properties under a corporation rather than individually.
Stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea boroughs, and represents 708 M£ over fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, North West and Yorkshire and Humber regions combined.
M. Cook said: “Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the outdated housing tax system. »
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Pregnuress real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector southwest of London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% percentage over the past year.
Prices in central London are steadily growing year-on-year by 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the south-west of the city, with the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise in the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal governments weighed on growth in U.S. car sales in October, with the automakers released Friday, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major Detroit automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he said that this slight brake was explained in the first place by the "government 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feeling during the first half of the month".
GM reported an increase of nearly 16% in sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by the consensus.
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-up trucks, has seen its sales increase by 14% over a year to 191 985 vehicles, while the consensus awaited 194 301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% in sales to 140 083 vehicles, against 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have sales below the consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the GM share gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford sold 1.1%.

A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Kramer said the project would “bring the UK together.”
Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” about working with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised up the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study railway capacity building and improved travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel time between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together. »
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it has are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. »
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support "unequivocally" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
M. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps. »
UN welcomes new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now be working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the preliminary draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “overtake national interests.”
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Parents of intersex children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enroll an “undetermined” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman. »
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and scanned.
It is estimated that one in 2 000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, with intersexuality being part of the group of some 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to attribute it, and then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical procedure, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems like a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery surrounding homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudice-based crimes.
Non-compliant young boys now have specially designed camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal lawsuit that allows her to keep an “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, we overturn two other pillars of civilization. »
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also told Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies when they were born.
“The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the gender of your child,” she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community considered gender as a slate, which can be erased and on which one can redesign.
But now, many people question the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual resignation when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, they did not call the psychiatrist, we would call the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He enshrined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals—the way parents raise a child—interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as John/Joan, his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sloppy circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and raising him like a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990’s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations said “[that] they are not satisfied with the outcome.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was taken on female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found out horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labelling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an ‘undetermined’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to attribute a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law will give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because “it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the name third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
German law concerns the allocation of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should fight at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammography radiologist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law will “responsibilize” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called androgenic insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law leaves parents some latitude so that they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before enrolling "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don’t have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“It puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
An octogenarian greets children with a rifle in Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were going door to door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The 86-year-old man explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His gun was seized.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts foiled by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare website, nor the drone attacks
The memoir of Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a book that's awfully sad these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the gloom of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical reports in the evening and went to bed, this book took me back to the days when politicians inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of the news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama’s transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82% of favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years after the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put great achievements to Obama’s credit, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our military, to the end of “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can’t provide any explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s misdeeds.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or the escape of public funding and the overrun of authorized expenses during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, she can’t excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to help determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we had heard about for so long.
Yet while the favorable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primary.
At an after-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to refocus on our talent,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
We've been 5 years later, Mr. President, and I don't agree with you anymore.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
The New Star has achieved a strong return, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10 000 candidates have presented themselves at the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perch André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
Why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored in this first bonus.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide choice of aspiring singers, for better or sometimes for worse.
However, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even went all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources familiar with the matter, which again shows that regulators’ global investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the world’s largest financial market investigations, where US$5.3 trillion change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of the manipulations of the interbank rate Libor.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank official said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter said RBS had forwarded records of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European Head of Cash Trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European head of spot exchange trading at Citi, was on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr.'s file Usher included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources familiar with the matter added.
UBS explained this week that it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks are peeling out instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the business by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of heavily liquid exchange rates, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange trades, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms, and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start to have an impact on the market at little cost.”
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in its office from the London Stock Exchange traded funds this week after it caused a loss of $6M at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control," said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Chinese newspaper that has issued a call “will be redesigned”
A Chinese newspaper that has issued a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be redesigned, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But M. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “full reshuffle,” the regulator said.
The order for "reshuffle" emanates from the Guangdon administration for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News group, published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The writing of New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card."
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately overhaul the newspaper’s management team.”
M. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But M. Chen then appeared on a state-run television channel where he admitted to posting fake stories for money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr.'s apology Chen, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Obama backs down on health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination of their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that are right for them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking about what he calls “an effervescence in the news” about terminations, President Obama has prompted Americans who were receiving these opinions to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-adapted health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll come out a winner,” he said.
The Authority has announced that it is not surprising that the 5% of the population who take out their own insurance are forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Sebelius said during her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed “miserably.”
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone else,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her microphone cut, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday’s Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Missouri’s Republican representative, to find out if she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to take out a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
The Folk Tribute of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prize of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich village and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had won the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen trio have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this comedy-packed film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich attire of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less glushing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing sold to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the tribulations of a folk singer who can not break through and get angry with the whole earth.
He accepts backward replacements at the foot in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not careerist but honest, with a self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and awards at Cannes, told reporters.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real personalities of the time such as folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would breed international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk, writes.
The film then takes on the appearance of a documentary, from the dusty music label invaded by 33T unsold inhabited by an unpayable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who crosses the film constantly: a beautiful red cat with a crisp look, companion of fortune of Llewyn Davis.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grew up in Tennessee, bathed in the blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be considered good", "coincidence can also launch someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Chevron, the second largest U.S. oil company, said on Friday it was down in its quarterly profit due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while staying behind the group's targets.
Its net profit in the third quarter declined to US$4.95 billion, or US$2.57 per share, up from US$5.25 billion, or US$2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected an average profit per share of US$2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from the 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with 25% output growth expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures have increased by seven billion dollars in two years and are expected to reach US$36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to US$380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
So Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a declining net profit on Thursday, despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the tragedy said they had responded to a call of "multiple injuries".
“The police are on the spot,” the airport said on Twitter, as television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed an evacuated person on a stretcher, and a second one was carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times said the 2 and 3 teminals are being evacuated.
The ASD spokesman was not in a position to immediately confirm whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
NSA spying: US ‘goes too far’, Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in terms of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in the first admission of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a U.S. government official explicitly admits to controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I concede to you, as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future,” Kerry said at a conference in London that he was participating in from Washington on Thursday, October 31 via video link.
In his retransmitted intervention, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of the American diplomacy has at length justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled numerous plans for attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We have in fact prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects,” he said.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far inappropriately," said the Secretary of State, who had already had to comment on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that President Obama was "solved to try to clarify and that he is reviewing these practices so that no one feels deceived."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says the program called "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the fiber optics used by the internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in the month of January alone – ranging from metadata on emails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such wiretaps, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services who allegedly seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not be aimed at Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also sparked the ire of China.
Early Puberty : Ageing Earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and health issues in children.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s bristles and pubic hair start growing at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the pedo-endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, it doesn’t indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first few periods in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, when it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the chest has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first periods appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test to find out how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – it’s something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Drug and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on the age of the child, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with the drugs but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their period.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years who link the percentage of fat mass to the triggering of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards genuine early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having a conversation sooner than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls with early puberty should be reassured that even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
A driver travelling at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was inflicted a £1 000 almond
A motorist was fined £1 000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a £100 victim surcharge.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenna 2" coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the association for the defense of hostages "Otages du monde", which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for the hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Detained more than 1 000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former big reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the set of the 20h of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
On the spot in particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says "we're freed," but I'm not sure, and tell me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
French people take us to the French Embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls for parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no way to evacuate to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on French soil go?
We land in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible jostle.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty.
The descent of the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull themselves the stuff to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from going up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and we're all the surgent in the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest thing.
The same evening, I'm at the 20h, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that are a bit like a holiday.
How were medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I had a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the days following my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It's not a session that does everything but we know we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not left to ourselves.
That's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
That was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I listen to what is being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, some less.
I try to make the difference between the questions about my past as a hostage and my cap of president of the association "Otages du monde" which allows me to put distance, and seems to me much more interesting to approach.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
In my opinion, there is a problem with semantics.
The hostage-taking of "political" hostage-taking - most of the time in this case - must be described as taking hostages and allow hostages to have access to justice, file a complaint and bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages could also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is for that.
Why not we say to the hostage-takers "you have flouted the rules of war, like those of all the conventions of Geneva, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me well-founded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skateboarders in the region.
Registration is taken on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and qualifying phases will begin immediately, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the prize handing over at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young Hyerish prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he does not like anything so much as to show competitors who exceed him by three heads.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will blow you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long Island stock market broker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast case of corruption on Wall Street."
In the 80's, Jordan Belfort mounted a scam that made him a rich, very wealthy man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has fallen behind schedule because of its too long assembly.
It seems that the film finally lasts 2h45.
In theaters on December 25, he will be able to participate narrowly in the race for Oscars.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, weighed down by Shell's poor results and the day after the Fed announced the continuation of its support for the economy, as expected.
In La Seyne, relocation due to rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the Lands du Sud Habitat office, proposed, in an exceptional and temporary way, to relocate the couple and his three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reason" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, said Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats have always been in the cities.
The deratization company carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not left abandoned, and the rats do not stun in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.
"We did not invite the rats to our home," defends the father who left his home to settle at the hotel.
We are soon penniless and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same price as the old.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure with 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of questionable assets in its balance sheet by 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it within three years.
RBS also said it would include a provision for depreciation of additional bad debts of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said the internal restructuring would free up 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow a line to be drawn from the past, the government having in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for the customer base and for the UK,” new chief executive Ross McEwan told reporters.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the choice to the Scots
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the headlines (and this was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a slim concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the bobbard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative for Germany Eurosceptic Party, founded only this year and arrived out of nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal election and took the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many people to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has placed favourable exchange rates on its members for German exporters – something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in public wages and spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper productivity-related malaise in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at consumer cost – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a prohibitive cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rumbling, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling to struggle.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the ruling socialists to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-money and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties look good in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment unique in Europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currency.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will make the eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
And Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to walk Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own motto.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed (and implemented) dark cuts by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the ensuing Conservative/Liberal-Democrat coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A house prey to the flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw some apparent smoke.
"So the alarms followed one another, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec City fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate shrine, located at an altitude of more than 3 000 meters, where many onlookers had gathered to observe his feat.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the ranks until becoming chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday sites, and fed countless greats of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with the open face, underbody skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I went from one castle the other!", ironically Bernard Vassion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents for whom he has officiated, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
In spite of heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to earthly foods, "they are all greedy", denounces gently Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who has restored the cheese, "it is someone who likes to eat" and "there is not much he does not like".
The current head of state, who regained the lost kilos before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart "François Hollande came to greet me ".
He said praise.
“His human side came out,” he said.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for his seventeen years.
A collision between two vehicles left four injured early Friday on Highway 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4am, a motorist who was travelling in a northerly direction, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6am on Friday.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been botched, argues a lawyer
After police confirmed they had got their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby claimed to have never seen an investigation "so botched."
Ruby said he believed the Canadian Press that police had "ignored or downplayed" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's casual friend and driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and accused him of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents said.
Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Police Chief Bill Blair had knowingly chosen not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in hand, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
She could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby’s remarks “an obvious and desperate attempt” to argue to the media in a case that does not concern him.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair said there was nothing in the video that could be "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the laying of a criminal charge against the mayor.
A Hamas armed wing fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, according to medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to the sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot by shells from an Israeli armored vehicle.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists’ union on Thursday urged its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the aftermath of new revelations about the activities of the U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid until further notice the use of Google and Yahoo’s search engines and messengers,” she said in a statement.
She considers the Washington Post's information "scandalous" that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
“The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling with the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment had the evacuation of the room and warned the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people came out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room yielded nothing.
Bad joke on a tear gas background?
Or involuntary incident?
Still, the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was aired and everything came back in order.
The cinema was able to take back its rights and the customers find the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which left two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, said Friday evening the deputy prosecutor of the King.
The expert dispatched to the scene by the prosecutor's office assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas buildup.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still committed.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and is badly burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the University Hospital of Liège, she by helicopter, him by ambulance," said the mayor José Paulet, who was descended on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
Firefighters from Andenne and Namur and the Arches Police intervened.
The Civil Protection of Crisnée has stabilized both buildings.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners struggle to find the money needed to repair the decrepit highway infrastructure, many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches above your car’s dashboard.
The aircraft, which record all miles traveled by a motorist and pass on the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the outdated funding system of major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you’re traveling, and possibly the route you’re driving, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is died.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about privacy.
And while members of Congress cannot agree whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They’re looking at how, over the next decade, they’ll be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts the state will start recording the miles traveled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as before.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a payment system per mile.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to the urban Liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the Free Market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay by the mile.
“It’s not just a tax rushing into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that are provided.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretaries of Transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way to payment per mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10 000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House has killed the proposal, addressing the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or in the city.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5 000 drivers to conduct the most important experiment in the country.
These motorists will soon pay the state a mileage fee instead of gas taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is investigating how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their every move.
“The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices. »
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car runs, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
She was looking to break into the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have pleased the schedulers of the main axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in pilot programs in some states.
There are much less expensive ways and much less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “payment to driving” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them," said a document on urban development.
However, some transportation planners are wondering if the whole debate about pay-a-mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gas taxes.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs, said.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, after exhausting all possible avenues under UK law after the Supreme Court overturned the appeal he filed against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow it to be transferred to the United States, it took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear at a police station, at the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after revealing more than 250 000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting against secret information.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his term.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the center-left leader said he had "firmly intended" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 his refusal to give in to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to be stopped.
In short, siphonage without limit of our pockets.
Millions of dollars squandered could be saved to allow for much-respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken away from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we do not hesitate about the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of lame ducks: cultural deficit center, high subsidy to the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell to the private company or demolish them.
It is also heartbreaking to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not for the public level to invest in such businesses, but in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that fishing and battery lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large decline in population, water use has decreased significantly throughout the territory.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In summary, it is very easy to achieve great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than 200 million dollars, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a borrowing settlement.
We have been run for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful diplomas for the most part and I don't believe a sheep farmer is doing worse.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, very close to the intersection of rue Beaubien, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A terraced foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time when the victim had just arrived at the construction site in order to recover his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I showed up and went to take off the big bricks that covered him.
You only saw a part of your back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Board was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The NSA is questioning an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its site
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday that it was a bug that caused its public site to crash for a few hours, not hackers like some claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the outage was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, a time nicknamed the “No Such Agency,” has come under the spotlight and sharply criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive nationwide and overseas communications monitoring programs — which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by former NSA disillusioned consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused much speculation that the incident tonight was the result of targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Downtown now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let go of its employees.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, and employees were interviewed individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned the building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a seniors' residence.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
Do you want a neon ice?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the bright protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something amazing but we’re still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2 g of this thing costs around £200. »
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seems opportune to share it with everyone at Halloween as it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me around £140.
But she tastes pretty good!
The Bristol-based experimental company Charlie is known for its unusual ice cream scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice cream. »
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I’ll find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver in the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning around 5h30, in the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unscathed to her.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9am, at the accident site, while the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation caused little traffic jam because the accident took place at the Heueaart exit.
Traffic was therefore deflected by this exit/inlet of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday. Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: “While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself. »
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believes the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told the Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will make sure to make this possible. »
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA has wiretapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it was necessary to take advantage of it.
M. Ströbele, German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
M. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden was testified in Germany, it would be necessary to give him the assurance that he would be "safe" there, said the MP.
M. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global response to “my political act of expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have ruled that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance is of public utility.
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns for L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but it does not surprise me particularly.
If in the past, the species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology will call into question the classification or the belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged because of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very morphologically close species were distinguished through genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this a major discovery, as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation perspective, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had already been known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the ability it has to recover from nearby stocks.
For the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the new discovery species originated, its stock has automatically become lower, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
The marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than in marine research, and it is high time for this to change.
Clive Palmer claims that Congressman Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system.
The mining tycoon, who is challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has argued this argument to try to rule out issues regarding a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But M. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr.'s daughters. Abbott was prepared to personally benefit from these policies.
"He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of her daughters is pregnant, he will have a vested interest in whether or not she gets a leave of absence," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast by 53 votes, after recounting.
M. Palmer put forward the idea of a reshuffle of the system of counting votes to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact details in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6h30 the next morning?
M. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the ballots.
Is it to be able to clear the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint concept paper with New Zealand.
M. Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take up his new duties “very seriously.”
Public service is a matter of public service.
“We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
When many equestrian protest experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his shetland toffee pony trotted during the three towers with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural dressage qualities for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been training with his Shetland pony every day every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are making a great duo. »
They presented themselves to and against all, but the two rounded up the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were crazy for joy that he won.
On the track, people who did not know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it. »
He ran the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he will surely soon participate in the Horse of the Year event – and I’m sure he will make a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian protest said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony. »
They are a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee were presenting well and how they marched on the track.
They are looking for an effective team effort between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really good.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson said that prior to their release, members of the military were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the military's "universality of service" rule requiring personnel to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for pension benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay another year to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universality of service.
M. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine how latitude it can grant to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans critic Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had made no secret of their irritation of Washington revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former deputy governor of northeast China’s Jilin province was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Excluding from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuan of bribes, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said the first intermediate court in Beijing on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that the justice system would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of former CPC chief in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state.
But the government has in no way expressed the intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Bombardier's profit down, as deliveries and aircraft orders decline
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual issues in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not provide flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the test aircraft only flew three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results did not live up to the forecasts and the stock price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its rating on Thursday, from “outperformance” to “sector performance” due to the stock market’s low upside potential in the next quarter or two quarters.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe that Bombardier will register new controls for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far up to 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company’s claims regarding the energy efficiency and the potential savings of the new airliner.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was moving in line with the schedule.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin during a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and plan an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, while the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are sceptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the schedule for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow flight test – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Incomes fell slightly from 4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a 10-cent per share result and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world said it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, up from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautical Division was 32.9 billion dollars as of September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to 2 billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest rail manufacturer, said the division’s revenues increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The Transport Division's backlog totalled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from the problems of execution concerning some large contracts.
Leaders announced that new indications would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s stock price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would serve on the board of directors, fell 8.5% to C$4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, said Thursday a 10% decline in its quarterly profit.
Kenyan press is outraged by controversial media law
“This is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse,” said Cyrus Kamau, chief executive officer of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent news stations and websites.
He said the new media court “will always be biased because it is an extension of government” and that content and advertising restrictions would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have “the control over the media.” The Standard, meanwhile, said democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a severe blow" and blasted the bill calling it a "draconian."
The passage of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting CCTV camera footage on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack supposedly stole the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interview them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media briefing.
Under the new bill, the media can be subject to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “delisted” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “lively blogosphere.”
By silence the media, politicians know they can do what they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering. »
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of people’s anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mirobolant wages of about 532 000 shillings per month tax-exempt month – which are among the highest in the world.
Two 23- and 27-year-old cavings had been missing in a chasm under the Crolls’ Tooth since Thursday night, according to the Isère Rescue Speleo on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one seasoned with practice and the other not, had left underground Thursday at about 9h30pm to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since, said the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5am," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Rescue Speleo in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on the spot
About twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French rescue Speleo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
In the late afternoon this Friday, the two cave scientists were located.
"This is another group of cavers who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambery, were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They got lost in the network, returned in their footsteps while waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Resupplished, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let's not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only for commuters.
I chose a card from France as a logo, he justifies.
When I talk about the suburbs, I address everyone who is excluded from the big national family.
Nevertheless, his project, presented Thursday in a press conference in his native commune of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all neighborhoods.
My proposal #1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even if he has not always been neutral.
Activist in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the equality values I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will listen to them too.
Only the extremist parties do I not speak.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - consultable on the Internet - from many themes supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of guardian of building...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene. "For the municipal elections of 2014, it may be fair, he admits."
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims to have already seven head of list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I have been receiving since yesterday do not all emanate from the suburbs," he rejoices.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the cemetery of the Trabuquet, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Wreaths were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the deputy mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently exploring the possibility of setting up a “authenticity” test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while it plans to extend the crackdown.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to hold unskilled positions or as a diverted way to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The smashing statements about ‘foreigners going back to the end’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return at the time when unions were calling for a protected labour market,” she told the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of whites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working document outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out "if the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or person concerned within the company sponsoring it".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is said to have died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The 9-year-old man's midly son was on his way to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
Issuing the right to abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court has reinstated in Texas some restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation passed in July in this state and largely challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice abortions will have to have an "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, under the status of a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the abortion argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be denied access to these facilities.
On Monday, a judge of first instance had ruled on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the trial ruling that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and chief executive Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just surrounded by the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had suffered a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle’s boss gave up a US$1.2 million bonus for fiscal 2013 ended May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but it received about US$77 million from stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire 2013 year, Oracle’s net profit grew by 3.5% while the stock price jumped by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% at the same time.
Tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have been negative, the health ministry said.
"The two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
The 22-year-old supermodel does not start his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg as a young girl in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama slits, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a forty-year-old addicted to sex since her teenage years.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with its eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on glossy paper will be displayed in much more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing her actresses into their last entrenchments, always for the better.
Stacy Martin has not finished talking about her.
Five years ago, my father wiped himself out of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep "frequenting" it.
There is no recipe, no instructions for using to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then there were signs.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, resting on the nightstand.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that’s what I thought the day I found his body empty, clenched on that hospital bed with crumpled sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a cold farewell focused around the meager glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small daytime or nightly apparitions, a little timid, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought which thought herself in mourning.
And then, it turned out to be revealed while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied this person, during her stay in life.
As she died, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and behold, I found her, full and complete.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "both inside and out" it seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a tough relationship with him until he became old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was afraid, when I had pain...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I could see his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never intrusive.
I could have a personal life.
He left my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream about them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was hoisting myself out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling and rejoicing that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happily sharing what was happening to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my stomach.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I enjoy telling this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused to the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and taking an interest in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a great school, have not been, in hindsight, harmless choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so that I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and the right to be of the spirit of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes resting on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago.
Died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers themselves, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time eased the pain.
Only the lack remained, this void without answer, this need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looking at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that weigh down his eyes, the fine lines around the lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on the days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of cancer at 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when morale is a little reached.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the retreat of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the path she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot tear it from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't see her burial and three weeks after he died, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, he is there on a daily basis.
I feel her presence and that makes me happy.
It's almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course diminished but it is always close to me.
Very often he "lands" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answered "I'm coming down" but in such a real voice that I woke up on a start, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was going to arrive.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a profession of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been detected in cans of beef products, sold by two small, low-cost British retailers, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine testing revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA up to 1 to 5%.
“Because horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product,” the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked food broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi prime minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We’re not telling the world to be by our side and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we’re part of it,” Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will expand too.
And what happens when a terrorism virus lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up placards accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master strength, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the Ligue 1 club in a statement.
PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco in the difference of goals, has broadcast the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply said he was "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
He nevertheless suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection, at the beginning of the month.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing vocalist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "he hit on me when I was 18."
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind. »
In a statement Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denies making advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else. »
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, “Prism,” came in at first place on the charts this week.
Clash between Palestinians and Israelis on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday evening, 31 October 2013, in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped operating Friday, November 1 after its fuel stockpiles were depleted, the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority said.
Local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas military wing executive, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials from the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a hundred-meter incursion inside the territory before withdrawing afterwards.
The clash lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during a foray by the Zionist occupier to Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed responsibility for the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas unleashed an explosive device targeting IDF forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
“This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians,” army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in northwest Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details of the target.
“In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he said.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi-powered capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Disney bets on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the website watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney Group’s channels is only scheduled for 2014, detailing the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the American West where she makes the order reign with a magical lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of those under 2 have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, of Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid emergency response, he died in this head-on collision.
The United States in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the partygoers have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade in the "Greenwich village" district.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints Day, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking a piece of information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutinies, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already lead the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, adjacent to Pitcairn.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle that passed in front of a local of the Golden Aube neo-Nazi party in the western suburbs of Athens, according to a police source.
The police were not currently in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards from their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the counter-terrorism service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and sealed off the neighborhood.
The incident comes weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 stuck in a carpet leaning standing behind the stands of his high school gym.
Investigators at the Lowndes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family disputed the findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he had died as stated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a schoolbag and were returned to them in a body bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I consider that there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a “positional asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence to warrant a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all CCTV recordings that investigators had reviewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video footage would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
Former Gestapo leader buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without his ever tracking, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he told the newspaper with a large print run on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great enigmas of the Post-War period.
The German secret services, the BND, thus assured and during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," according to M. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general's uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were notably his service with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of Berlin's Mitte district indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the neighborhood.
The president of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a tasteless enormity.
"We roughly trample with our feet the memory of the victims," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had, in particular, under his command, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Egypt calls on the first freely elected president to take the oath
Mohamed Morsi took the inauguration oath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the inauguration oath of the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi has also become the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges in black court robes whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” he said. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in court to cheer the new president and, standing out from the presidential splendor of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “sight wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has strengthened considerably since his victory and his speech on Friday during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian president Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges in the woodwork room where he was sworn in.
Later, M. Morsi went to Cairo University where he gave his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he got at attention.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the university's grand amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
M. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which started the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and vowed to recover the presidential powers whose military council, which replaced the former ousted president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
The speech of M. Morsi in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel over the width of the seats while large controls are in play
The dispute is raging between the major aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow which takes place by months.
The conflict is about the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but where the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy classes, but its great American rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute has broken out as aircraft manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, eventually hoping for a record order at the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged in the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its refurbished “777X” will be able to accommodate 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to realize recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept that? "
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, Airbus' chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American’s waist circumference of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival is clinging to a headquarters concept that dates back to the 1950's, when the circumference of the aircraft freshly called "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study that indicates that an additional thumb in the width of the seats would improve the quality of sleep by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’s gearwiseness figures and says it’s not up to automakers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that cabin experience does not only depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s passenger satisfaction manager.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to control aircraft for an estimated amount of at least 700 billion dollars at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the configuration of the sieges is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a yield per seat in their latest models of two-engine long-haul 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the configured 777X with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to fit more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, director of Comfort Passenger at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial perspective, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors who travel around the world even take with them a meter to check competing configurations.
While wiping out of offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider seats on the driveway side on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to set a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could make forget the wave of sales of 777X.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot’s novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760’s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
The musical, that beast of the stage
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It is a revolution: the French-style musical asserts itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts would become entangled in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or The Wretches carried the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage­ ­Entertainment in Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like hit hits.
The first takes up, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the worldwide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances like "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and the small musicals like "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicales" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the hard-conquered success.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer multiplied.
There are first the "musical shows" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use good image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year leap back on the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt ­Pokora headliner.
Afterwards, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage ­Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying a ­-perceive.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" are struggling to be financed.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing on Broadway, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of the musical, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and this is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Musical shows fill this lack.
It is these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
To propose beautiful young men (often talented) at the headliner of a musical show, it is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are cleverly held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise was mounted in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major cinemas in France in the same form as in Paris.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Finishes 0.88% Down, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The odds suffered from the dollar’s decline against the yen, detrimental to exporting values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11 percent to 1,668 yen.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of vaudeville Frank Fay, who played the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until it was more recently taken over by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music night for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present, among others.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional tours, for example presenting shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the theme of the joyfully lascivious fantasy football of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and was a cast of the series Parks and Recreation, but she is best known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.”
Kroll and Slate, along with other young actors with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting is held at City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would walk down an alley between two buildings and say to himself, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway track
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-foot-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging over a length equivalent to nearly six long football pitches, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to conceal trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it by going unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intention to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway tracks that departed from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day ahead of the deadline of
1st November set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or “enable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country is thought to have about 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin nerve agent.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The group of activists, which is tracking the evolution of the human toll through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, of which 18 678 were fighters of pro-government forces and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2 202 were deserters and some 5 375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels, many of whom are linked to groups of the Al-Qaeda network, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within tight deadlines.
An OPCW statement, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all the declared critical production and the machines for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was unclear at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I salute the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the organization, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales were charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
M. Hare told Gail Furness, a counsel to the Board, that he had knowledge of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate, noting, “External controls of the YMCA have been carried out and have indicated that child safety is a top priority for the organization. »
The Commission was shown to have been informed that it received the second worst assessments in four institutions during a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August this year.
M. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management of staff was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But M. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA has a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures toward child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was left alone with the children, kept them in private, had them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she found the YMCA Caringbah's head of children's services, Jacqui Barnat, who was supervising Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their supervisor.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relationship they had with Lord blurred their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
M. Hare said he had expressed his views before the YMCA council in New South Wales that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonaton Lord incident" should not concern "the report" by the staff, and the council agreed with him.
M. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were raised was made by YMCA Director General for Child Services Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "overzeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, from 2009 to 2011, the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith told the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruiting, controlling, initiating, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
A ceremony in memory of the dead crematized
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for mayor of Paris must attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals in the field of funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on the Ethics of the Funeral, insists on the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasure of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replies Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Société de thanatologie and author of the book Taming Death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of a wait, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the remission of the ashes," observes Mr. Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect him to the others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize the farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of Father Lachaise, since 1998.
Masters of ceremonies are often people who have converted.
There are also ancient Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, lay and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who were crematized in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
Hagel blames 9 U.S. states for violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses have been entitled to a Department of Defense identity card and the benefits that come with it,” the minister recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard" located in their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The slingshot of the nine states began by Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texas National Guard, because of a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned with the recognition of same-sex marriage to about 5600 people active, 17 000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
The price of oil continues to fall and is approaching $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China’s electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in the late morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China’s manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, which show activity growth, suggest rising demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second infused by the famous piano solos Gymnopedias of Satie.
An evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, in profile, thin like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple stroke, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, wait on each side of the playground, rush when the next graph appears, embody it, emerge while running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relays of solos, in group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Gloire du matin", where, solo, Chouinard was performing a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online at the forefront.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance rug, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of the poem of Michaux, monochord and monotonous in the scream, and continue dancing.
And the music to leave, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if it can, ends up deafening and numb.
As is also the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a strength in Chouinard - like this hair that ruffles or these black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, imposed herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies seem flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt forms, open a wider and giboed imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The public loved it, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their awkwardness in music, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, pass the couples, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, sporting the red nose, in very polarized male-female parades.
Loves are carnivoists, fleeing or players.
The gestures, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies into coitus, beings that blend.
But the play takes off its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on the scene when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superimposed, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play the codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it's the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
A lot of fire in a business
A fire severely damaged a business in the borough of LaSalle, in Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescuers were called around 1am on Friday because of a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian food restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to control the blaze.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said Richard Bordeaux, chief of operations for the Montreal Fire Department.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived at the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
Report: Obama’s campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and recounted Thursday night that the president’s close associates had conducted “in-depth group work and polls in late 2011” to see if Biden’s ouster could help Obama with a view to his re-election as his hopes diminished.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House general Secretary Bill Daley, to measure the effect of the vice president’s replacement by former Secretary of State Clinton on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept in the Chicago Campaign HQ and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “did not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I’d looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were like, “Lord, what can we do? "
While Daley called the exam “concerted,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
"The campaigns don't spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was looking at the replacement.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the eventual reshuffle.
Although Daley said he did not think the president “was aware” of the possible change, the former secretary general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively address the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden’s ousting from the presidential list was being considered.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
David Bowie: Four new listeners
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unpublished.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in a side.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not surprised, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has planned to reissue this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be in the form of three records: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten more tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box set in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own prints, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new track Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a rock electricity carefully mastered.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal his charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a bright cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even to Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, bewitching, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: in turn informant, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
A helicopter bird from a North Sea platform has been released into the wild
A bird, helitre-killed after being found depleted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water rail was brought up aboard a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was set back by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This water rail was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea. »
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help. »
The water rail was healthy when it was released.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter, and ultimately the video-on-demand service Netflix via their TV in the future that doesn’t seem so far away.
The Cogeco subsidiary said on Thursday it was currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more numerous options,” said Louis Audet, president and CEO of Cogeco.
Cogeco Cable is thus following suit with its competitors, such as Bell, even if the subsidiary of Cogeco does not yet have a specific date with respect to this new platform.
"We must adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable companies so that its service is available through their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable's CEO also welcomed the Harper government's announcement during its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wishes to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
“It’s been about two and a half years since we’ve been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important channel packages doesn’t work,” Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to some interesting recommendations.
"These discussions will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new framework of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," said CEO of Cogeco.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decline from the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline with depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the US-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for 1.36 billion.
This was the company's first major acquisition after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for 526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, from the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable’s revenue, however, grew by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up 5546.
M. Audet is not worried about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very strong competition.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria pipeline inaugurates new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe’s largest large-scale project,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, a country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe transits, increases the level of risk compared to conventional channels, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other countries downstream by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Unknown people shoot a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Encougulated strangers opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without causing casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and cracks down on the protests of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English literature classes, students will have to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be removed.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the raw subjects to undergo a radical review.
It will make changes in other core matters next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Regular Office of Examinations, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence,” stressing that the GCSEs would be “more challenging, ambitious and rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students are about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of schedule to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the in-depth math GCSE – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The program will place greater emphasis on "real-world issues", including financial mathematics.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1 000 business leaders, broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that controlling these key competencies should return to Westminster’s hands.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of the large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and what is even more telling, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority want to see Britain continue initiatives to change the treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists on a “significant change” that gives power back to the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would allow for a 16% shift in votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is embarking on the path of a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for companies this means once again focusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
“Backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia,” the head of China’s security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gas cans against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declares to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, a former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
Firefighters were called in to rescue a lost puppy after getting stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spanel, had escaped after a crash without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her trapped dog in the career
Firefighters rappelled along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to safely recover it while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spanel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and appealed to social media sites after she disappeared into the quarry following a serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with sharp eyes who was walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and descended as a reminder to rescue Ruby using a pet stretcher to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation. »
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical relief specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get out of it unscathed. »
She could have been badly hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified while watching the rescue. »
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in your arms again.
The vet said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely great.
M. Keighley’s Alderson added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move. »
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Ukraine is getting closer to bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt score goes to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again in a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will ensure that enough foreign exchange is needed to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and forecasts that the trend will continue.
This makes it difficult to repay credits taken abroad.
These reservations, which the authorities use heavily to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency is increasingly considering a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to pay its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of 882 million dollars.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of sharp tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction.
Its still relatively modest debt has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budget deficit, has been demanding for months the help of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it in 2010 a credit of 15.3 billion dollars and has for the moment released only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranches until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "significant external financing needs" constituted "vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Center for Political Studies, "we cannot wait for an improvement in the short term."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections are scheduled for 2015, according to the expert, interviewed to AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P further notes the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions on the release of the opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” said S&P, who fears Moscow’s “trade restrictions.”
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that if a free trade zone is created between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls for imported goods.
Singapore’s pawnshops take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnshop at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga drops off a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works too, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became the third pledged loan company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Paying on jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1 300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pawnshops charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not seeking credit checks or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising costs of living and over-indebtedness in households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to make up for the difference as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited growing household debt, stemming mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, while the rate stood at 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued low exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people rush to pledge their personal belongings to receive the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city-state’s 200 pay-on-pay shops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn the grandmother's gold chain and we'll come back to get it next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshop shops, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The rise is such in the pawnshop industry that ValueMax, the store’s operator in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore’s 66 million dollars it raised this week when it was IPO of the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have come under criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt,” she says.
Pawning is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term guaranteed financing.
The people who go to the pawnshops are also not just those who have financial problems.
Affluent Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pledge shops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“It can be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that have cash flow needs to take a difficult course,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
The cocaine addict who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Assize Court
A major defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigating his drug-related activities after compromising because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "key record", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain unlawful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored by police at the time in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other men, they were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, at Liverpool's Assize Court, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn law firm of Forbes Solicitors, fell out of favor after being convicted on two counts of impeding justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, pure at 60%, under the lawyer's trash cans in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the depot, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the football stadium in Ewood Park, which is pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drug, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied consuming cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and taken a hair sample.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he sometimes called him at home for legal reasons.
But the court heard testimony that it was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone needs to know that you should not break the law, it is a criminal lawyer. »
M. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
M. Ditta did not honor her profession, but disgraced her.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately. »
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he started getting drugs from criminal organizations. »
His addiction to cocaine compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the ruling members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and build trust with the public.
M. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of her profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of three counts of cocaine possession and now impeding justice, demonstrating her commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in the trafficking of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question and answer session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Renault hecked in the stock market by Nissan warning
Renault on Friday recorded the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had declined by nearly 20% its annual net profit forecast, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault share was affected this morning by the "warning".
“It’s clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” says a trading manager for a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official told Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was the subject of three alarms with the fire department.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in a close way.
The burned-out house housed four units, but no tenant was on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was all limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a whole stir to the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity or departure leave altogether, the pharmacy department was severely staffed.
Nearly 30% of the necessary staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time committed pharmacist.
We didn't use troubleshooting," Beaudet said.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or decreased to level, while things change.
Of course, we worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There's a combination of circumstances that made it a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 promises to be significantly easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit, because the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain in the job of the CSSS.
Now, it's much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Ever increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always ride three maternity leaves when it goes well, she added.
The last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.

Anger caused by the sentence handed down against one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who has spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killings for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and left many injured.
He has also been convicted of many other counts in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have sought life imprisonment, yet they could have asked the man, who is called a “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, to the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the firing squad," Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into an outside parked van, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "died" three times while under respiratory assistance.
M. Hugh said Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of Jemaah Islamiyah’s terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he mocked the grief he may have caused to other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” said Corteen.
Patek can appeal his conviction.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair reportedly replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it can likely happen, so... »
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a strike on a U.S. drone in Pakistan on Friday, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist officials said this time that he lost his life in the strike in the North Waziristan region.
“We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone fire,” a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a visit to London, informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency room of the Hôtel-Dieu
Faced with the slingshot conducted for several months by a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "defease the schedule for implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4".
A request officially made "to not run any risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but which also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on this date.
Even if, at the APHP, it is preferable to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters – who provided about a quarter of the 40 000 annual visits to the Hôtel-Dieu emergency room – will all have been instructed to take the thirty serious cases a day to the emergency room of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency interns will give way on Monday to five general medicine interns.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency department of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4," said Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the project of the management.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients urgently," he said, arguing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide to close the emergency department.
"Things are done gradually," said Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to her," said emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Removed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the slingshot against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "whistleblower" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
For him, "if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
They are regularly engorged.
There are, for example, sometimes nine hours of waiting at the Lariboisière emergency room.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
At the ARS as at the APHP, we defend the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which should continue to accommodate 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the implementation of an "outpatient care."
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of emergency not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity hospitals.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best care offer.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change gears, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor of Paris and elected of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on November 4.
If this were the case, it would mark its clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to the other hospitals.
Did you think the travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and expects record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit over the entire year between 325 and $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of 305 to 315 million dollars.
If the current forecast is met, it will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre made 8% of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had started in force, especially with regard to non-business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we operate are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, which made it possible to compensate for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, the leisure travel sector at Flight Centre has performed well while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand is lower and was expected to derive profit over the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares grew 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
GM recalls some of its new pickup trucks in the United States to fix the seatback
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19 000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to fix a problem with manually reclining records, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. agency responsible for regulating vehicle safety.
In some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
Accordingly, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to homeowners due to the 16-day shutdown of government operations, slowing vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 Silverado pickups and 16 503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price climbed 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Arctic Monkeys Postpones Concert in Glasgow Due to Alex Turner's Disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after its singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform Friday in the The Hydro concert hall downtown.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show to Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st. »
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert. »
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will be held on 21 November.
All tickets are still valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Coming to Ask Him About Drug Case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugs, according to several media reports.

Pope Francis to name his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest-ranking churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so it goes to a group of 120 “cardinal voters”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as necessary for the number of cardinal voters to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important as it will be the first since this year’s election of Pope Francis in March, Valero said.
For the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on his own.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was "quite possible" that Francis would seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”

Vettel holds a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky one, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
Germany’s Sebastian Vettel, a four-time Formula 1 world champion, held a special helmet for the free practice of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, in the context of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automotive brand, of its team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his booth.
Vettel was to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, in the test.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi drills, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st movement of Tai Chi, with his hands as a musician who cracked the air,” Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was Master Tai Chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she promised her husband, the week before he died, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even though we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joie de vivre he had,” she added.

Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country Thursday morning at the Montréal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
That's part of the investigation," said CBSA spokesman Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau airport have completed 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region completed a total of 1653 seizures of narcotics.
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
Phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times had dedicated it as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the scene of the 198 and 199th installments of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also went back to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, assured to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"Undoubtedly between 120 and 150 million all countries combined," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on Avenue Foch close to the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, pointing to a stack of books on the coffee table between bronzes or ivories brought back from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, wearing a gun or an assault rifle.
Inside, his serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian disangered aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches himself in the thick of all the bad guys of the earth, communists of the 70's and 80's, then jihadists from the 90's.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, of the Albert London type, who went there and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said "to make a kind of geopolitical soap opera."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people of the services that I know for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often prescient: so, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The Way to Damascus".
In "The Fools of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he recounted the columns of 4X4 jihadists who founded the Malian capital.
I am not guessed, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses are realized.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "all parts of which have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "END" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than I am.

Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
China's homeland security chief on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghur separatists from being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, rushed into the crowd that stood in the famous square of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau for Internal Security Issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic movement of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking minority living in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are taking place there animated by independence demands.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
“The group that was held behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan,” he added, his remarks being echoed by the new China news agency.
Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Repainted fires: MP calls for Brigitte Grouwels to resign
The project of the Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "relifting" the posts of the traffic lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 traffic light posts of the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The goal is both to "increase security" and "Brussel identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flemishization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with spending the money of the Brussels people crazy in operations to relift the signalling poles in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of flamandizing the Capital," said Mr. De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted herself in dark-blue-black yellow the Brussels posts.
According to the MP, there is no longer "a difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brussels residents deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes or 0.5% of Brussels people!" concludes Mr. From Bock.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the ground.
The leak of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear boiler rooms of Charles de Gaulle, in mid-October and while the boat was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, specialist in the naval defense, assures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing boiler room.
“Everything is being done to ensure that the Charles de Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” says DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not call into question the program of activity of the boat" with nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is coming out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify the young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", confined to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
He goes in a Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased away
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred with an armband with the swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the facility that called police, the store said Friday.
“We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store,” a spokeswoman for the supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "by the time it arrives, it had already left without a stanger," she added.
I was waiting in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were speechless.
“You don’t get out on the street like that unless you want to get attention,” a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to disguise yourself as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted footage of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing an SS black armband twice a week for three years at Asda’s,” Dutton said, explaining he had “mental problems.”
