It's a story about how we know what we know.
It's a story about this woman Natalia Rybczynski.
She's a paleobiologist, which means she's a specialist in digging up old dead stuff.
Natalia Rybczynski: Yes, sometimes I was called “Dr. Things Dead.”
Latif Nasser: I think she's interesting because of where she works, far above the Arctic Circle in Canada's isolated tundra.
One summer day in 2006, she was at a excavation site called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude from the magnetic north pole.
NR: Frankly it doesn’t look exciting, because it was a day of walking with a backpack, a GPS and a notebook, and we picked up everything that could be a fossil.
LN: And at some point, she noticed something.
NR : Rusty, red-rust color, big like the palm of my hand.
He was just sitting on the floor.
LN: And at first, she thought it was just a splinter, like those found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before - pieces of prehistoric plants.
But that night, back to camp,...
NR : ... I take out a magnifying glass, I look at it more closely and I realize that it doesn't have the growth rings of a tree.
It may be his conservation, but it really looks like...
One bone.
LN: So, during the next four years, she returned to this place many times, and in the end she collected 30 fragments of the same bone, most of them very small.
NR: It's not that much. It fits in a little plastic bag.
LN: And she tried to put them together like a puzzle.
But it was stimulating.
NR: It's all broken in so many small pieces, I try with sand and putty, but in vain.
So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
LN : Ooh! NR: Yes, exactly.
LN: But it was easier to do it virtually.
NR: It’s a little magical when everything comes together.
LN: How did you know it was good, that they were assembled properly?
Could it have been possible to assemble them differently to have a parakeet or something else?
NR: Uh, no. No, it couldn't be that.
LN: She found out that what she had was a tibia, a leg bone, and precisely, the bone with a forked hoof mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't be one of those.
It was just too big.
NR: The size of this thing was huge. It is a very large animal.
LN: So, what animal could it be?
In the deadlock, she showed one of the fragments to her colleagues in Colorado, and they had an idea.
NR: We took a saw, and we just made a cut on the edge, and there was this very interesting smell that escaped.
LN: It smelled like russy flesh.
It was a smell that Natalia recognized after cutting a lot of skulls in her disgusting anatomy lab: collagen.
Collagen is what gives our bones their structure.
And in general, after so many years, it breaks down.
But in this case, the Arctic had acted as a natural freezer and kept it.
Then, a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that one of her colleagues, Mike Buckley, was presenting a new method called "the collagen footprint."
It turns out that all species have slightly different collagen structures, so if we have the collagen profile of an unknown bone, we can compare it to that of known species, and, who knows, perhaps they correspond.
So she sent him one of the fragments, by FedEx.
NR: Yes, we wanted to follow him. That was pretty important
LN: He studied it, and compared it to 37 known modern mammal species.
And he found a match.
It turns out that the 3.5-million-year-old bone that Natalia dug up from the High Arctic belonged to...
A camel.
NR: And I was like, “That’s great — if that’s true. »
LN: They tested several fragments and they had the same result each time.
However, based on the size of the bone they had found, this camel seemed to be 30% larger than modern camels.
So this camel would have been almost 2.80 meters, and weighed near a ton.
And yes.
Natalia had found a giant Arctic camel.
Well, when you hear the word "camel", what should come to your mind is one of them, the camel of Bactrian of the East and Central Asia.
But it is possible that you have in mind a picture of a postcard like this, the dromedary, the animal typical of the desert -- which lives in the sand of warm places, such as the Middle East or the Sahara, with a large bump on the back where it stores water for its meharees, and with large and wide feet that help it climb the sand dunes.
So, how do we explain that one of them ended up in the High Arctic?
In fact, scientists have known for a long time, even before the discovery of Natalia, that originally camels are American.
They started here.
For 40 of the 45 million years since camels have existed, it could be found that in North America, about 20 different species, perhaps more.
If we aligned them all, would we see any differences?
NR: Yes, the bodies will have different sizes.
You're gonna have some with very long necks, which will actually be like giraffes.
LN: Some had mouths, like crocodiles.
NR: The most primitive would have been very small, almost like rabbits.
LN : What? Camels the size of a rabbit?
NR : The oldest.
So probably you wouldn't recognize them.
LN: Damn it, I want a camel rabbit.
NR: I know, that would be great.
LN: And three to seven million years ago, a branch of camels descended into South America, where they became the lamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed the Earth tongue from the Bering to Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the last ice age, the North American camels went out.
So the scientists already knew all this, but that doesn't really explain why Natalia found one so far north.
Because, in terms of temperature, this is exactly the opposite of the Sahara.
To be frank, 3 and a half million years ago, the average temperature was 22°C warmer than today.
So there would have been a boreal forest, more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But still, they would have had winters that lasted 6 months during which the ponds were frozen.
There would have been blizzards.
There would have been 24-hour days completely plunged into darkness.
So, how... How? How?
How is it possible that one of these superstars of the Sahara can survive in this Arctic environment?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.
And that's kind of great.
What if the characteristics that make the camel fit so well in places like the Sahara, had actually evolved to help it endure the winter?
What if these wide feet were made, not to walk on sand, but in the snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
What if this bump -- which, by the way, big news for me, doesn't contain water, but fat -- was there to help the camel endure these six-month winters, when food is scarce?
And then, only later, after crossing the land bridge he used these features to fit the burning deserts?
For example, the bump can be useful to camels for desert climates because having all their fat in the same place, like a fat backpack, it means that they do not have this insulating layer on the rest of the body.
So the heat dissipates more easily.
It is this crazy idea that the attributes of the camel that prove, in our opinion, its desert nature may in fact prove its past in the Arctic.
I'm not the first to tell this story.
Some have talked about it to beautify the biology of evolution or to give an overview of the future of climate change.
But I love him for any other reason.
For me, it’s a story about us, how we see the world, and how that changes.
I have a history degree.
And I learned that in fact a lot of scientists are also historians.
They make sense of the past.
They tell the story of our universe, of our planet, of life on it.
And as a historian, we start with a certain idea of the unfolding of history.
NR: We make stories and that's all, like the camel in the desert.
It's a great story! She sticks well to the idea.
They apparently still lived there.
LN: But at any time, you can discover a tiny piece of evidence.
We can learn a little bit that will force us to review everything we thought we knew.
For example, in this case, there is a scientist who finds this shine thinking that he is a piece of wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and really counterintuitive theory that shows why this creature, appearing to come out of Dr. Seuss' drawings, is as it is.
And for me, it completely changed the way I see the camel.
It has passed from being this ridiculous creature only adapted to a specific environment, to this great traveler who has just arrived in the Sahara, and who could theoretically arrive anywhere.
This is Azuri.
Azuri, hi, how are you?
Okay, here, I got this for you.
Azuri is on vacation, usually he's at his concerts at Radio City Music Hall.
It's not even a joke.
In short -- Azuri is here as living proof, to remind us that the history of our world is dynamic.
Only our will can help us to readjust it, to reinvent it.
Isn't it, Azuri?
And really, we're all at a piece of bone to see the world differently.
Thank you very much.
Today's computers are so incredible that we don't realize how bad they are.
I would like to talk to you about this problem today and how we can solve it with neuroscience.
First of all, I would like to take you back to Harlem on a cold night in 2011 that deeply marked me.
I was sitting at a bar not far from Columbia University, where I was studying computer science and neuroscience and I was in a big conversation with another student about the ability of holograms to replace computers one day.
As we got to the best moment of the conversation, of course, his phone turns on.
He takes it out, looks at it and starts typing something.
Then he forces his eyes to come back to me and he says, “Continue. I'm listening. »
But of course, his eyes were absent, and the time had passed.
Meanwhile, in this bar, I saw another student holding his phone, this time to a group.
He scrolled through photos on Instagram, and those kids laughed hysterically.
This dichotomy between my feeling of unease and the joy they felt about the same technology made me question.
The more I thought about it, the more I realized that here, the problem was clearly not the digital information, it was only the position of use that separated me from my friend and that brought these kids together.
They were connected around something just like our ancestors who improved their social knowledge by telling stories around the campfire.
I think that’s exactly what the tools should do.
Extend our bodies.
I think that today computers do the opposite.
Whether you send an email to your wife, make a symphony, or console a friend, you do it pretty much the same way.
You are leaning over these rectangles, you tap on buttons, menus and more rectangles.
I think that's the wrong way. I think we can start using a more natural machine.
We should use machines that bring our work back into this world.
Machines that use the principles of neuroscience to prolong our senses, not go against them.
It actually turns out I have such a machine.
Her name is Meta 2.
Let's test it!
In front of me, I can see an audience, and I can see my hands.
And in three, two, one, we will see appear an immersive hologram, a very realistic hologram appears in front of me, from the glasses that I wear.
Of course, this could be something we buy or learn, and I can use my hands to move them finely.
I think Iron Man would be proud.
We'll get back to that a little later.
Now if you’re like me, your mind is already in shock about the possibilities we have with this type of technology, let’s look at a few.
My mother is an architect, of course the first thing I imagined was to draw a 3D building instead of using these 2D plans.
There, it touches graphics and selects an interior decor.
Everything was filmed with a GoPro with our own glasses.
This next case is really special for me, it is the brain glasses project of Professor Adam Gazzaley, provided by the UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I will always fantasize about the possibility of learning and memorizing these complex brain structures with a real machine, I could touch and play with these different brain structures.
What you see now is called augmented reality, but for me, it’s part of a much bigger story — a story about how we start extending our bodies through digital objects, rather than the other way around.
Now...
I think that in the next few years, humanity will experience a change.
We will begin to put an entire layer of digital information about the real world.
Imagine for a moment what it would mean for storytellers, painters, neurosurgeons, interior designers and perhaps for all of us here today.
And what we need to do as a community is to try and make the effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, rather than glowing our reality or cluttering it with digital information.
That is what I really are passionate about.
Now I want to tell you a little secret.
In about five years — it’s not the smallest device — in about five years, they’ll all look like strips of glass on our eyes that will project holograms.
Since we don't care much about the phone we buy for its technical characteristics — we buy it for the operating system — as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of creating the "iOS of the mind" if you want.
It’s very, very important to do things right, because we could live in these things for at least as long as the time spent with the Windows user interface.
And I don't know you, but living inside Windows scares me.
To isolate the most intuitive interface from infinity, we use neuroscience to create our design principles, rather than a bunch of designers arguing in meetings.
The principle on which we all rely is what is called the “Neural Path of the Most Low Resistance. »
Each time, we try to connect the iOS of our brain with our brain according to, for the very first time, our conditions.
In other words, we try to create a computer without a learning curve.
We build a system that you know how to use since always.
Here is the first of the three principles we use in this brand new user experience.
First of all, you are the operating system.
Classic file systems are complex and abstract, require extra steps from your brain to decode them.
We are upsetting the Neural Path of Lower Resistance.
Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you place your TED holographic panel right there, and your holographic email across the office, and your evolved space memory retrieves them.
You could put your holographic Tesla you’re buying — or any model my legal team told me to put on.
Perfect. Your brain knows exactly how to get him back.
We call the second “Touch to See” interface principle.
What do babies do when they see something that attracts attention?
They're trying to get to him, to touch him.
This is exactly how the natural machine should work.
It turns out that the visual system has an essential boost of a meaning called proprioception — that is the meaning of the members of our body in space.
By directly touching our work, we will not only better control it, but we will also better understand it.
And so, touch to see.
But that's not enough to feel things.
We are intrinsically social primates.
This brings me to our third principle, the holographic campfire of our first story.
Our mirror neural system suggests that we can better connect with each other and with our work if we can see our faces and hands in 3D.
So if you watch the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around this object, instead of being distracted by external devices.
Let's continue and try again with neuroscience in mind.
Again, our favorite interface, the iOS of the mind.
I'll now go further and catch that pair of glasses and leave it here next to the office.
I'm with you right now we're connected.
My space memory has started, and I can catch it and put it back here, remembering that I'm the operating system.
And my proprioception is running, and I can continue and explode these glasses into thousands of pieces and touch the sensor that is scanning my hand.
But that's not enough to see the objects alone, in a second, co-founder Ray is going to call in 3D -- Ray?
Hey, Ray, how are you?
I can see this person entirely in front of me in 3D.
And he's pretty realistic.
Thank you.
My mirror neural system suggests that this will replace phones in a short time.
Ray, how are you?
Ray : Very good. We are live today.
MG: Ray, give the audience a gift from the holographic brain that we saw earlier.
This will not only replace phones, but it will also change the way we collaborate.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Ray.
Ray : Of nothing.
MG: Well, here’s the message I discovered in a bar in 2011: the future of computers isn’t stuck inside one of these screens.
He's right there in us.
If there is only one idea I can give today, it is that the natural machine is not the fruit of the future, it is right here in 2016.
That’s why all of us at Meta, including administrative staff, executives, designers, engineers — before TED2017, we’re all going to trash our external monitors and replace them with truly, deeply more natural machines.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, that's very sweet.
Thank you all.
Chris Anderson: Well, explain one thing to me, because there were few demonstrations about augmented reality last year or previously here.
And there is sometimes a debate among technologists about whether we really see the real object on screen.
This is a field of vision problem. In a way, the technology shows a wider view than the one you should see while wearing the glasses.
Have we seen real life?
MG: Absolutely real life.
And not only that, we took other steps to film with a GoPro with the real lenses, the different videos streamed.
We want to try to simulate the experience of the world we see through the glasses, and not cut any passage.
CA : Thank you very much for this presentation.
MG: Thank you very much, it was a pleasure.
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States: Seattle, Washington.
I grew up with a family of great Seattelites.
My mother was an artist, my father a professor at the university, and I am grateful for my childhood, because I have always been completely comfortable living my life as I see fit.
In fact, I took a path that was not the one my parents had imagined.
At 19, I dropped out of college -- abandoned, fired, cutting my hair in four.
I went on tour as a professional horn player, which was my dream of always.
I played chamber music across the United States and Europe, I was 2 years on tour with a great jazz player: Charlie Bird.
Approaching my 30 years, I finished a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a life!
My parents never complained.
They supported me all along.
It was not their dream.
They said to their neighbors and friends, “Our son is taking a sabbatical decade. »
And -- There's been, however, an embarrassing conversation about my lifestyle that I'd like to talk to you about.
I was 27 years old, I had returned from Barcelona, I was at my parents' house for Christmas, I was preparing dinner with my mother and we were alone in the kitchen.
And she was silent, too quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said, "Mom, what are you thinking? »
She said, “Your father and I are worried about you. »
I said, "What? “What could it be?
And she said, "I want you to be completely honest: did you vote Republican? »
Actually, I wasn't very political, I was just a horn player.
I had an epiphany, they had perceived it and it caused confusion.
I had become an enthusiast of capitalism and I want to explain what it is.
This was born out of the interest I have always had for, believe it or not, poverty.
When I was a kid, growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty.
We were a lower middle-class family, but of course it's not real poverty.
It's even far from it.
The first time I saw poverty and its face, I was 6 or 7 years old, in the early 70s.
And, as with many of you, it was a prosaic and banal example.
It was a photograph in National Geographic of a child my age in eastern Africa, there were flies on his face and a distended stomach.
He wasn't going to get away with it, I knew it and I was powerless.
Some of you remember this image, not exactly this one, but a similar one.
It revealed the dark misery to the West.
This vision haunted me as I grew up, went to school, gave up, did something else and started a family.
And I wondered what happened to that kid
Or others like him all over the world.
I studied, even if I was not in college, I was looking for an answer: what happened to the poorest people in the world?
Did it get worse, he improved? What?
I found the answer and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you.
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since our childhood since they saw this photo.
Ask Americans how poverty has evolved in the world, 70% will say that hunger in the world has worsened since the early 70s.
But here is the truth.
Here's the epiphany that changed my way of thinking.
Between the 1970s and today, the percentage of the world's population living in famine, living on less than a dollar a day, adjusted for inflation, this percentage has fallen by 80%.
There has been an 80% reduction in the most severe global poverty since my childhood.
And I didn't even know it.
This, my friends, is a miracle.
We must celebrate it.
It is the greatest anti-poverty achievement in human history, and it happens in our lifetime.
When I learned this, I asked: what did that, made it possible?
If you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you want to remake it and get out of poverty the next two billion, because that is what we are talking about: since my childhood, two billion of these, our brothers and sisters, have emerged from poverty.
I want the next two billion, so I need to know why.
I've been looking for an answer.
She wasn't political because I didn't care.
I always don't care.
I wanted the best response from the traditional economists on the left, right and center.
Here she is.
Here are the reasons.
These are the five reasons why two billion of our brothers and sisters have been out of poverty since I was a child.
The first: globalization.
The second: free trade.
The third: heritage rights.
The fourth: the rule of law.
The fifth: entrepreneurship.
It was the system of free enterprise spreading around the world after 1970 that did this.
I'm not naive.
I know that free enterprise is not perfect and that free enterprise is not enough to build a better world.
But she's awesome.
And it goes beyond politics.
Here's what I learned, my epiphany.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
Its main asset is the aspiration, which is what many people speak of on this stage, the aspiration that comes from the dreams incorporated into the system of free enterprise.
We have to share it with more people.
I want to talk to you about a second epiphany that is related to the first and that can bring us progress, not only in the world but also in our country.
The best quote I’ve heard to sum up the thoughts I just mentioned about lifting people out of poverty is this: “Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history.
They have lifted billions out of poverty. »
Who said that?
It looks like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
That's not true.
President Barack Obama said so.
Why do I know her by heart?
Because he was talking to me.
It's crazy.
And I said, "Hallelujah! »
But, more than that, I said, “What an opportunity. »
You know what I was thinking?
I was at an event on this subject at Georgetown University in May 2015.
And I thought that was the solution to America's biggest problem today. What is it?
It is to come together around these ideas, liberal and conservative, to help those who need them most.
No need to tell you that we are in crisis, in America and in many countries in the politically polarized world.
This has happened to a critical level of crisis.
It's unpleasant. It's not fair.
Last year, there was an article in the Procedures of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
It was a 2014 article on the asymmetry of political motivations.
What is it? What is it? Psychologists call this the phenomenon of the presumption that your ideology is based on love but that your opponent’s ideology is based on hate.
It is common in a global conflict.
You expect, for example, to see it between Palestinians and Israelis.
What the authors of this article have discovered is that today in America, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from asymmetry of political motivations.
Today, a majority of politically active people think they are motivated by love but the other party is motivated by hate.
Think about it. Think about it.
Most people say, “My ideology is based on fundamental benevolence, I want to help people, but others are demonic and want to hurt me. »
Society cannot progress when there is this type of asymmetry.
That's impossible.
How to solve this?
First, let’s be honest: there are differences.
Let's not minimize the differences. That would be naive.
There is a lot of research on this.
A veteran of the TED scene is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He works on the ideology, values and morals of different people to see their differences.
He showed us, for example, that the Conservatives and the Liberals have a different emphasis on what they think is important.
For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care 59% more about poverty than economic freedom.
And the Conservatives care 28 percent more about economic freedom than poverty.
Irreconcilable differences?
We will never gather. False.
It is in diversity that our strength is found.
Remember what lifted us out of poverty.
It was an obsession with poverty accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world.
We need others, in other words, if we are to help people and lift the next two billion out of poverty.
There is no other solution.
How are we going to do it?
That's delicate.
We need to innovate in the way we think.
There are many points on stage.
Social Entrepreneurship. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. phenomenal.
We need to invest abroad in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
But what do we really need?
of a flexible ideology,
Less predictable.
No? No?
Do you ever feel that your ideology is becoming predictable?
Almost conventional?
Don't you feel like you always listen to people who agree with you?
Why is it dangerous?
Because when we talk about the economy in this country, on the right, the Conservatives, you always talk about taxes, regulations, a great government.
And on the left, the Liberals, you're always talking about income inequality.
These are important things, very important to me and to you.
But when it comes to helping people who are starving and need us, they are distractions.
We need to come together around the best ways to alleviate poverty by using the best tools at our disposal, it only comes when the Conservatives recognize that they need the Liberals and their obsession with poverty, and the Conservative Liberals and their obsession with the free market.
It is in this diversity that the future strength of this country lies, if we choose it.
How are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together?
I need an action plan, not just for you but for me.
Number one. First point: it is not enough to tolerate people who disagree.
That's not enough.
Let’s remember that we need people who disagree, because there are people who need all of us, who are still waiting for these tools.
What are you gonna do? How will you express it?
Where does it start? It starts here.
In this room, we are all lucky.
Lucky to have people listening to us.
Lucky to prosper. Lucky to lead.
When people hear us, with unpredictable ideology, they may listen to us.
Progress may begin there.
That's the first point. The second.
Deuzio: I ask you and I wonder to be specifically the person who blurs the border, who is ambiguous, difficult to classify.
If you are a conservative, be a conservative who always talks about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior to the poor.
If you are a liberal, be a liberal who always talks about the beauty of free markets, used responsibly, to solve our problems.
If we do that, we get two things.
A : we are starting to work for the next billions and to be the solution we have seen in the past and need in the future. We get that.
And the second thing is that we could be able to take the dreadful sacred ideological war we suffer from in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect.
And then maybe, perhaps, we will realize that our big differences are ultimately not so big.
Thank you.
At university, I specialized in Political Science so I had to write a lot of essays.
When a normal student writes a dissertation, he spreads the work a bit like that.
You know... You may start slowly, but you write a little during the first week and associated with more productive days, in the end, everything is done and everyone stays calm.
And I'd like to do that like that.
That would be the goal. Everything would be prepared. But the essay comes and then I do that.
And that's the way it is for every essay.
Then came my last year 90-page thesis, a document you are supposed to be working on for a year.
I knew that for such an essay, my usual pace was not viable.
So I planned everything, and I decided I had to get to something like that.
The year was going to unfold like this.
So I was going to start light, and I was going to increase in the middle months, and in the end, I was going to set the top speed, like a small staircase.
Go up stairs, where is the difficulty?
It's not much, is it?
But then something funny happened.
Those first few months?
They came and passed and I couldn't really work.
So we have a revised super plan.
And then... But then these middle months came and I didn't really write a word, so we were here.
Then, two months turn into a month, which turns into two weeks.
And one day, I wake up three days before the deadline, still not writing a word. So I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, with not one, but two sleepless nights. Humans are not meant to spend two sleepless nights. I ran across the campus, dived in slow motion, and gave the essay just before the deadline.
I thought it was the end of it.
But a week later, I got a phone call from college.
And they say, “Tim Urban? »
And I replied, “Yes. »
“We need to talk about your thesis. »
"OK. »
And they say, "That's the best we've ever seen. »
That's not true.
It was a very, very bad thesis.
I just wanted to enjoy this one moment when you all thought, “This guy is fantastic! »
No, she was very bad.
I am writing a blog today.
I write the blog Wait But Why.
A few years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always bewildered the non-procrastinators around me. I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what is happening in our head, why we are like this.
I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators are actually different from other people's brains.
To test this, I found a laboratory with MRI that allowed me to scan my brain and that of a proven non-procrastinator, so that I could compare them.
I brought them here to show them to you today.
I want you to look closely to identify a difference.
I know that if you're not brain experts, it's not that obvious, but try.
So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
Now...
Here is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both brains have a Rational Decision Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
What does this mean for the procrastinator?
That means everything is fine until this happens.
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive. But the Monkey doesn’t like this plan, so he’s getting behind the wheel and he’s saying, “In fact, let’s read the entire Wikipedia page about the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that. »
So... So we're going to the fridge to see if there's anything new since the last 10 minutes.
After that, we embark on a YouTube spiral that begins with videos of Richard Feynman on magnets and ends much much later with interviews with Justin Bieber's mother.
“It’s all going to take some time so we’re not going to have the time to work today. Sorry! Sorry! »
What's going on here?
The Monkey doesn't seem to be someone you want behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he is only interested in two things: ease and fun.
In the animal world, it works properly.
If you’re a dog and you spend your life doing just easy and fun things, you’re fantastic!
For the Monkey, humans are just another animal species.
You have to sleep, eat and create a new generation. This could work in prehistory.
But if you haven't noticed, we don't live in prehistory.
We live in advanced civilization and the Monkey doesn't know what it is.
That's why we have another person in our brains, the Rational Decision Maker who gives us the ability to do things that no other animal can do.
We can project ourselves into the future.
We can get an overview of the situation.
We can do long-term projects.
And he wants to take all this into account.
And he wants us to just do what's logical, right here and now.
Sometimes it makes sense to do easy and fun things, like when you’re going to go to bed or enjoy well-deserved free time.
There is overlap. Sometimes they agree.
But on other occasions, it makes much more sense to do more difficult and less pleasant things, in the interest of the situation as a whole.
Then there is a conflict.
For the procrastinator, this conflict tends to end in the same way each time, letting him spend a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place, totally out of the Logic Circle.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators know very well.
This is where you have free time activities when they shouldn't take place.
The fun you have on the Dark Playground is actually not fun, because it is undeserved and the air is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-deser, all those feelings of good procrastinator.
In this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, the question is: how can the procrastinator get here in the blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things are done?
It turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel. Someone who always watches over him in his worst moments. Someone called the Panic Monster.
The Panic Monster sleeps most of the time but he wakes up abruptly every time a deadline gets too close or there is a danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or any other terrible consequence.
And most importantly, it's the only thing the Monkey is afraid of.
It became very relevant in my life very recently, when the people at TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to give a presentation.
Of course, I said yes.
It was always my dream to have made a presentation for TED.
Phrase in the past: But in the midst of this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else in mind.
He said, “Do you understand what you have accepted?
Do you understand what will happen now?
We have to sit down and work on that now. »
And the Monkey said: “Quite okay but let’s open Google Earth and look at the south of India, like 50 m above the ground, and scroll through the map for 2h30, until we reach the north of the country, in order to better understand India. »
That's what we did that day.
While six months turn into four, then in two and in a month the people of TED decided to publish the names of the speakers.
I opened the website and saw my face looking at me.
And guess who woke up?
The Panic Monster begins to lose its mind, and a few seconds later, it's anarchy throughout the system.
And the Monkey, remember, he's terrified by the Panic Boom Monster, here he is at the top of the tree!
And finally, the Rational Decision Maker can get behind the wheel and I can start working on the presentation.
The Panic Monster explains a lot of the rather insane behavior of the procrastinator, like how someone like me can spend two weeks unable to start a phrase of an essay and miraculously find the incredible work ethic to stay awake all night to write 8 pages.
This whole situation, with these three characters, is the procrastinator's system.
It's not nice, but in the end, it works.
That’s what I decided to write about on the blog a few years ago.
When I did, I was amazed at the answers.
Thousands of emails have arrived, from all over the world, from all sorts of people, doing all sorts of things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and many, many thesards.
They all wrote to say the same thing: “I also have this problem. »
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the article and the heavy tone of these emails.
These people wrote with intense frustration about what procrastination had done with their lives, what the Monkey had done to them.
I thought about it and I said: if the procrastinator system works, where is the problem?
Why do these people feel so bad?
Apparently, there are two types of procrastination.
The examples I gave today all have a deadline.
If there is a deadline, the effects of procrastination are contained in the short term because the Panic Monster interferes.
But there is a second type who arrives in situations without a deadline.
If you want a career as an independent, something in the arts or entrepreneurship, at first, there is no deadline for these things because nothing happens, before you start the hard work to gain momentum for things to move forward. Lots of important things
Outside of your career, like your family, your health, exercising, working on your romantic relationship, or getting out of it when it’s not working.
If the procrastinator's only mechanism to do difficult things is the Panic Monster, it is a problem because in all these situations without a deadline, he is not there, he has no reason to wake up. The effects of procrastination are not contained and spread to infinity.
It is this type of long-term procrastination that is much less visible and of which much less than the one more fun, in the short term based on deadlines.
We often suffer in silence and in private.
It can be a source of a huge amount of sorrow and regret.
That’s why these people were sending me these emails and why they felt so bad.
It's not that they were beating on some projects.
Long-term procrastination has sometimes made them spectators of their own lives.
The frustration is not that they can’t achieve their dreams, it’s that they can’t even make the first move.
So I read these emails and I had a kind of illumination: I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
That's right. I think you're all procrastinators.
You may not all be in a bad state like some of us......and some here may have a healthy relationship with deadlines. But remember: the greatest trap of the Monkey arrives when the deadlines do not exist.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the Calendar of Life.
A box for each week for a life of 90 years.
It's not so many boxes, especially when you've already used a lot of them.
I think we should all look closely at this schedule.
We have to think about the topics we procrastinate about because everyone procrastinates about something in their life.
We must remain aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
It is a job for all of us.
There are not that many boxes, so it is a job that should probably start today.
Actually, maybe not today...
You know...
Soon.
Thank you.
We were there, souls and bodies crammed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives.
Piled into a room just like this, but with old wooden benches draped in a worn red fabric, an organ on my left and a choir behind me, the baptismal font embedded in the wall behind it.
A room like this, though.
With this same formidable feeling of suspense, the same deep hopes of salvation, the same sweat in the palms, and the same people deep down who do not listen.
It was December 31, 1999, the night of Christ’s second coming, and the end of the world as I knew him.
I was 12 that year, and I had reached the age of responsibility.
After I stopped complaining about the injustice of Jesus' return at the time I had to be held accountable for my actions, I understood that it was better for me to clean quickly.
I went to church as often as possible.
I was watching for silence with the anxiety of someone who would be waiting for the noise, trying to make sure that the Lord had not played me a trick and had decided to come back earlier.
And in case He came back earlier, I had anticipated a backup plan, reading the series of the "Fight Behind" that was making a card at the time.
I found in their pages that if I wasn't taken at midnight, I had another chance.
It was enough for me to avoid taking the mark of the beast, fighting demons, plagues and the Antichrist himself.
It would be difficult — but I knew I could do it.
But it was no longer the time to organize.
It was 23h50.
We had 10 minutes left, and my pastor called us to the altar, for he wanted to pray when midnight would ring.
Each faction of the congregation took its place.
The choir remained in the choir, the deacons and their wives—or the Baptiste Bourgeoisie, as I like to call them—put themselves in the front row in front of the altar.
You see, in the United States, even the second coming of Christ has a VIP section.
And just behind the Bourgeoisie Baptiste were the elderly — those men and women whose backs had once curved under the warm sun of the cotton fields of eastern Texas, whose skins seemed marked with a smooth, noble brown, just as the clay of East Texas, whose hopes and dreams about the future of their lives outside of East Texas had sometimes been broken,
More deeply than their backs.
Yes, these men and women were the stars of the show for me.
They had waited for this moment all their lives, as their predecessors of the Middle Ages had eagerly awaited the end of the world, and as my grandmother was waiting for the Oprah Winfrey Show on Channel 8, every day, at 4pm.
And as she went to the altar, I was hiding behind her, for I was absolutely certain that my grandmother would go to Heaven.
And I thought that if I held her hand tightly during the prayer, it was possible that I would go with her.
So I held his hand, and closed my eyes, to listen, to wait.
The prayers became stronger.
And the cries in response to the call of prayer rose even higher.
The organ joined the funeral atmosphere.
And the nascent heat joined in the sweat.
My hand strengthens its embrace, not to be the abandoned one.
I closed my eyes harder, so I wouldn't see the separation of the good grain from the tares.
Then a voice rose above us: “Amen. »
It was over.
I looked at the clock.
It was midnight past.
I looked at the older believers, whose Savior had not come, who were too proud to show their disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to begin to doubt now.
But I was upset for them.
They had been deceived, deceived, embossed, and I had allowed myself to be taken with them.
I had said their prayers, I had not yielded to the temptation as best I could.
I hadn't dipped my head once, but twice, in those baptismal fonts that gave the die.
I thought.
And now what?
I came home in time to turn on the TV and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as he advanced around the world.
I was struck by the oddity of the multiple returns of Jesus, based on the various time zones.
And I felt even more ridiculous — hurt, really.
But that night, I kept believing.
I just started to believe a new thing: that it was possible not to believe.
It was possible that the answers were wrong, that the questions themselves were false.
From now on, where a mountain of certainty had been, there was, rushing to its base, a source of doubt, a source that promised rivers.
I can find the origin of the entire drama of my life that night in this church, when my Savior did not come for me; when what I really believed had turned out to be, if not a lie, at least, not quite the truth.
Although some have prepared for the year 2000 in a very different way, I am convinced that you are here because a part of you has done the same thing as I have done since the beginning of this new century, since my mother left, my father did not return and my Lord refused to come.
And I reached out my hand, to reach something to believe in.
I held on, when I arrived in Yale at 18, confident that my trip from Oak Cliff, Texas, was a chance to leave behind all the hardships I had known, the dreams and the broken bodies I had seen.
But when I found myself at home during a winter holiday, my face on the floor, my hands tied behind my back, and a burglar's gun on my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me.
I held on when I arrived at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008.
So hopeful — that I called my family to inform them that we would never be poor again.
But when I saw this temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I knew that even the best job could not save me.
I held on when I arrived in Washington, as a young employee, who had heard a voice from Illinois, saying, “We have been waiting a long time, but with this election, change has happened in the United States. »
But when Congress stopped, the country tore itself apart, hope and change sounded like a joke, I knew that even the second political coming could not save me.
I had faithfully kneeled at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time, gods of success, money, and power.
But again and again, midnight was ringing, and I opened my eyes to see the death of all these gods.
From this cemetery, I began to look once again, not out of courage, but because I knew that either I believed or died.
So I made a pilgrimage, again to another Mecca, Harvard Business School — knowing this time that I couldn’t just accept the salvation she claimed to offer.
No, I knew there would be more work to do.
The work began late, in a dark corner of a crowded party, the night of an early and miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I wondered what young people looking for authenticity have been wondering for a very long time: “What if we went on the road? »
We didn’t know where to go or how to go, but we knew we had to.
All our lives, we longed, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to “squeeze into the night and disappear somewhere,” and go see what everyone else was doing all over the country.
Although other voices said that the risk was too great and the evidence too thin, we still left.
We traveled nearly 13 000 km across America in the summer of 2013, through the pastures of Montana, through the desolation of Detroit, the New Orleans marshes, where we found and worked with men and women who were creating small businesses whose intention defined the goals.
Having been trained at the western end of capitalism, this has appeared to us as a revolutionary idea.
And this idea has spread, developing into a non-profit organization, MBAs Across America a movement that has made me land here, on this stage, today.
This idea developed because we discovered that our generation is hungry for purpose, meaning,
Because we found countless entrepreneurs in every corner of America, who created jobs, changed lives and needed a little help.
But if I'm honest, she also developed because I fought for it.
I have spared no effort to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could close the wounds of a broken country, one social enterprise at a time.
But it was this gospel journey that led me to this rather different gospel that I came to share with you today.
This trip began one evening, almost a year ago, at the Natural History Museum in New York, during a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School.
Under a replica of a life-size whale, I sat down with the titans of our time, while they celebrated their peers and good deeds.
There was pride in a room where value and net assets under management exceeded 500 billion dollars.
We looked at everything we did, and that was good.
But chance did that two days later I had to get not far from there, to Harlem. I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony telling me about the children who came here every day.
They were all living below the poverty line.
Many of them carried their possessions in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them participated in Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, in order to receive their only meal of the day.
Tony told me that he threw Harlem Grown with the money from his retirement, after 20 years as a taxi driver.
He told me that he was not paying himself, because, despite his success, the program was struggling to get resources.
He told me he would accept all the help he could get.
And I was there to help.
When I left Tony, I felt the burning and salt of the tears that came to my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation that I could sit in a room, one evening, where a few hundred people had 500 billion dollars and in another room, two days later, just 5 kilometers away, where a man lived without pay for a child to have his only meal of the day.
It wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry. It was not the thought of these hungry children, homeless, it was not rabies towards the 1% or pity towards the 99%.
No, I was disturbed because I finally realized that I was the dialysis of a country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story replaced all those who were expected to take charge of them, even if they had nothing to grip to take charge of themselves; that my body replaced all the structural, systemic aid that never went to Harlem, or the Appalachians or the floor -9, that my voice replaced all those voices that seemed too ignorant, too proletarian.
And that shame, that shame has overwhelmed me, like the shame of sitting in front of the TV watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium, again, and again, and again.
I had been deceived, deceived, boosed.
But this time, the fake Savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from the altar, the night I thought the world was coming to an end, from a world where people spoke in tongues, considered suffering a necessary act of God, and took a text as an infallible truth.
Yes, I've come so far that I find myself exactly where I started.
Because it’s simply wrong to say that we live in an era of unbelief — no, we believe today as much as before.
Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
We can believe in the New Yorker Bible or the Harvard Business Review.
We can believe deeply when we worship here, at TED Church, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe.
We speak the language of charismatic leaders who promise to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as a necessary act of capitalism, our God. We take the text of technological progress as the infallible truth.
And we barely realize the human price we pay, when we fail to question a brick, lest it destroy all our foundations.
But if you are disturbed by the unacceptable things we have finally accepted, then it must be time for a questioning.
I have no disruption or innovation gospel, or a triple line of results.
Actually, I don't have a gospel of faith to share with you today.
I have, and I offer, a gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not require that you cease to believe, but that you believe in something new: that it is possible not to believe.
It is possible that the answers are false, that the questions themselves are false.
Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong.
Because it raises the question: “Why? »
With all the power we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so much?
This doubt leads me to share that we place my organization, MBAs Across America, in cessation of activity.
We have fired our team and closed our doors, and we will share our model freely with all those who seize the power to do this work without waiting for our permission.
This doubt forces me to give up the role of savior that some expect of me, because there is not enough time and our chances are too slim to wait for the seconds to come, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here.
And this doubt, it regenerates me, it gives me hope, that when our problems overwhelm us, when the paths designed for us seem to lead us to our loss, when our healers bring no help to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith — no, it will be our humble doubt that will illuminate a little the darkness of our lives and our world, and will allow us to make our voices heard to whisper
or to shout, or simply say, very simply: “There must be another way. »
Thank you.
The food crisis
is in the news every day.
But what is it?
In some parts of the world, there is too little food, or maybe too much.
GMOs save the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Too many agricultural runoffs create toxic oceans, the decline in food.
And so on.
I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disheartening.
How can we bring this subject back to something we understand?
What does this apple say about the food crisis?
You all ate an apple last week, I'm sure.
How old do you think she was when she was picked?
Two weeks?
Two months?
Eleven months. This is the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
And I don’t think it’s very different in Europe or anywhere else in the world.
We pick them, we put them in refrigerated warehouses, we gas the warehouses. There is actually documented evidence from workers who are trying to go into these environments to recover an apple, and who die because the atmosphere to slow down the ripening of the apple is toxic to humans.
How come none of you knew?
Why didn't I know that?
90% of the quality of this apple, all antioxidants, are gone when it arrives at our home.
In fact, it's just a little sugar ball.
How do we have so little information and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform.
I know the platforms. I know computers. I was glued to the Internet when I was young.
I've done some very strange things...... on this platform.
But I met people, and I could speak.
How can we express ourselves in food?
If we had a platform, we might feel able to ask: If only?
I wondered: What if... the climate was democratic?
So, here's a map of the climate in the world.
The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
They change, replace each other, and California farmers are now Mexican.
China is taking land in Brazil to grow better food, and we are the slaves of the climate.
What if each country had its own productive climate?
What would it change in the way we live?
What would change for the quality of life and food?
The problem of the previous generation was having more food and having it cheaper.
Welcome to your overall farm.
We built a huge analog farm.
All these lines are cars, airplanes, trains and transport.
It’s a miracle that we’re feeding seven billion people with only a few of us involved in food production.
And what would happen if...
We were building a digital farm?
A digital farm in the world.
What if you could take this apple, scan it somehow, send it into particles in the air and piece it off on the other side?
What would happen?
Let's take a few quotes. She inspires me in what I do.
The first: "Japanese agriculture has no childhood, no water, no land and no future. Here I discovered this when I went to Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the disaster.
The children have gone to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is contaminated, they already import 70% of their own food.
But that is not just about Japan.
2% of the U.S. population is involved in agriculture.
What good answer can come from only 2% of the population?
By going around the world, 50% of the African population is under the age of 18.
80% of them do not want to become a farmer.
Agriculture is difficult.
The life of a small agricultural entrepreneur is miserable.
They're heading to the city.
In India, farmers do not have access to basic services. There are more suicides of farmers this year than the previous 10.
It makes it uncomfortable to talk about it.
Where are they going?
To the city.
There are no more young people, and everyone is leaving.
So how can we build a platform that would inspire young people?
Welcome to the new tractor.
This is my combine-harvester.
A few years ago now, I went to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and Home Depot and started hacking.
I built stupid stuff, made the plants dance, connected them to my computer, and I killed them all; I killed a lot of them.
I finally managed to keep them alive.
And I created one of the most intimate relationships of my entire existence, because I learned the language of plants.
I wanted to make bigger.
I was told, “Fun, young man!
Here's a former electronics lab that no one wants.
What can you do? »
With my team, we built a farm inside the Media Lab, a famous place, not for biology, but rather for computer science.
Inside these 6 m2 we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month. It's not much food.
There are plenty of interesting technologies in there.
But the most interesting thing?
Beautiful roots, white, green colors, deep and a monthly harvest.
Is this a new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new grocery store?
I can assure you something: this is the first time that someone in the Media Lab has ripped the roots of anything.
We have salads in a bag, there is nothing wrong with that.
But what happens when you have an image processing expert, a data specialist, a roboticist, who pulls out roots and thinks, "I know a little about it. I can do it, I want to try. »
In this context, we would grow the plants and bring some of them back to the laboratory, because if you grow them, you do not throw, you attach yourself to them.
I have funny taste buds now; I'm afraid to let anyone eat something without having tasted it, because I want it to be good.
I eat lettuce every day and I can give its pH to about 0.1.
And I say, "No, her pH is 6.1, you can't eat it today. »
That lettuce that day was super sweet.
She was super sweet because the plant was stressed and she had caused a chemical reaction in her to protect herself: “I’m not going to die! »
And plants that don't want to die, seem sweet to me.
Technologists fall backwards in the face of plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to try.
We wanted to see what people can create, we designed a lab that can be shipped anywhere.
Then we built it.
On the facade of the Media Lab, there is my laboratory, which has about 30 detection points per plant.
If you know the genome or the genetics, that's the phenom, okay?
The phenomena.
When you say, “I love strawberries from Mexico,” you really like the strawberries of the climate that produced the expression you like.
So if you code the climate - this amount of CO2 and this amount of oxygen create a recipe - you code the expression of this plant, the nutrition of this plant, the size of this plant, the shape, color, texture.
We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors to tell us what's going on.
Think about your houseplants! You're super sad because you're wondering, "Why are you dying? Why don't you talk to me? »
Farmers acquire a unique capacity when they pass the 60 or 70 year old.
They can say when a plant dies that it is a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency or that it needs more water.
This unique ability is not transmitted.
Here are the omens of the “farmer in the cloud.”
We track this data over time.
We correlate them with special plants.
These are all broccoli in my laboratory, by IP address.
Our broccoli can be reached by IP address.
And if that’s not weird enough, you click once and get the profile of a plant.
And it gives you the downloadable evolution of this plant, but not as you think, not just when it is ready.
When does it reach the nutrition I need?
When does it reach the desired taste?
Is she getting too much water?
Is she getting too much sunlight?
Alerts.
She can talk to me, she's a dialogue, we have a language.
I think she is the first user of the Facebook Plants!
This is his plant profile and this plant will start to make friends.
I think she will make friends with other plants that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus, less potassium.
We will learn more about a complexity that we could only assume.
Maybe they won’t become our friends, maybe they will, it will depend on us.
This is my laboratory.
It is a little more organized, my job is to design data centers for hospitals, so I know well the creation of controlled environments.
And so, within this environment, we experience all sorts of things.
This aeroponic process was developed by NASA for the Mir space station to reduce the amount of water sent into space.
This process gives exactly what the plant wants: water, minerals and oxygen.
The roots are not that complicated. When you give them this, you get an amazing result.
It's like the plant has two hearts.
And because she has two hearts, she grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect world.
We have advanced in techno and seeds for an unfavorable world and we will continue to do so, but we also have a new tool, which is a perfect world.
We've grown all sorts of things.
These tomatoes had not been produced and sold for 150 years.
Did you know that we have rare and old seed banks?
Seed banks.
That's incredible.
They have genetic material, things you've never eaten.
I'm the only person in this room who ate this kind of tomato.
It's a tomato for sauce that we can't cook. We ate that tomato. And it wasn't great.
We did things with protein, all sorts of things.
We grew humans. Maybe you would, but we didn't.
What we realized was... the tool was too big, and too expensive.
I was starting to distribute it around the world and it cost about $100 000.
Finding someone with 100 000 in their pocket is not easy, so we tried to make it smaller.
It was the project of one of my undergraduate mechanical engineering students, Camille.
Camille and me and the whole team, we tried all summer, how to make it cheaper, that it works better, that others can do it.
We dropped them off in schools, from the sixth to the final year.
And if you want to remain humble, try teaching children.
I went to school and said, “Set the humidity to 65%. »
A middle schooler told me, “What is humidity? »
I replied, “Water in the air. »
He said, "There's no water in the air, you're an idiot. »
And I said, "All right...
Don't trust me.
Set it to 100. »
He puts it at 100 and what happens?
It's starting to condense, making fog and, finally, drops.
And he said, "Oh. Humidity is rain.
Why didn't you tell me? »
We created an interface like a game.
They have a 3D environment, they can connect anywhere in the world from their smartphone or tablet.
They have the different parts of the bots, the sensors.
They choose recipes created by other children all over the world.
They select and activate this recipe, they plant a seedling.
While it's pushing, they're making changes.
Why does a plant need CO2?
Is CO2 bad? He's killing people! »
Intensify the CO2, the plant dies.
Reduce CO2, the plant is going very well.
Harvest the plant, You have just created a new digital recipe.
It is a design, an iterative development, and an exploration process.
They can download all the data about this new plant they developed or the new digital recipe and what it did - was it better or worse?
Think of it as the little hearts of the process.
We're going to learn so much.
Here is one of the food food, as we call them, in a school after three weeks.
It's three weeks of growth.
But more importantly, it was the first time this kid thought he could be a farmer — or that he might want to be a farmer.
We put everything in open source.
Everything is online; try to build your first food service.
It's gonna be hard - I'm telling you.
We are at the beginning, but it's all there.
It is very important to me that it is easily accessible.
We will continue to move in that direction.
They are farmers, engineers in electricity, mechanics, environment, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban planners,
on a single platform, doing what they are good at.
But we've seen a little too big.
This is my new installation that we just launched.
This warehouse could be everywhere.
That's why I chose him.
And inside this warehouse we are going to build something a little like that.
These already exist.
Look. Look.
These exist too.
One allows you to grow green, the other can produce the Ebola vaccine.
It is cool that this factory, a big winner of the DARPA challenge, is one of the reasons for the progress on Ebola.
The factories produce the protein that resists the Ebola virus.
Pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, up to simple lettuce.
But these two things are nothing like each other, and that's where I'm in my field.
Everything is different.
We are at this bizarre stage of the : “We are almost there. “It’s a little bit like, ‘Here’s my black box. "No, buy mine."
"No, no - I have intellectual property, quite valid.
Don't buy his, buy mine. »
In fact, we are just at the beginning, at a time when society is also changing.
While we ask for more food but cheaper, we ask for a better diet that respects the environment.
When you have a McDonald’s ad that explains what’s in the McNuggets, — the most mysterious food product of all time — on which their marketing campaign is based, everything is changing.
From now on,
Personal food computers, food servers, and food data centers run on open phenomena.
Think open genome, but we’re going to add small climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can retrieve, update and grow.
What does this look like in reality?
Do you remember the planet connected by lines?
We're starting to get the beacons.
We start sending information about food, rather than sending the food.
This is not only my dream, it is the places where we already deploy.
Food computers, food servers, soon food data centers, connecting people to share information.
The future of food is not to fight against what is wrong.
We know what's wrong.
The future of food is on the networking of the next billion peasants and offer them power with the help of a platform to ask and answer the question, "What would happen if? »
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel ashamed to be a European.
Last year, more than a million people in need of our help arrived in Europe and our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of Alan Kurdi, a two-year-old child, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have drowned in the Mediterranean.
International treaties recognize that refugees are a collective responsibility, and yet we accept that the small Lebanon welcomes more Syrians than the whole of Europe combined.
We lament the existence of smugglers, yet we are making it the only viable route to seek asylum in Europe.
We lack the workforce, yet we prevent people who meet our economic and demographic needs to come to Europe.
We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, however -- we have policies of repression that arrest minor asylum seekers, separate children from their families and seize the property of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did we get to this point that we adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
I don't think it's because of a disinterest, at least I don't want to believe it.
I believe that it is because our politicians have no vision, that they do not know how to adapt the international rules of asylum, created more than 50 years ago, to globalization.
I want to take a step back and ask two fundamental questions, the two questions that we all have to ask.
First, why is the current system not working?
Second, how can we fix it?
The current refugee regime was created as a result of the consequences of the Second World War by these people.
Its primary purpose is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its people, people have a place to go, where to live in safety and with dignity until they can return.
It was created precisely for situations such as the current situation in Syria.
Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, States have pledged to admit to each other people fleeing conflict and persecution on their territory.
But today, this system fails.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In practice, our immigration policies are blocking the path to security.
In theory, refugees have the right to integration or return to their country of origin.
But in practice, they get stuck in eternal limbo.
In theory, refugees are a common global responsibility.
In practice, geography means that countries close to the conflict welcome the overwhelming majority of refugees.
The system is not broken because the rules are bad
but because we do not properly apply them to a changing world, and that is what we must reconsider.
I will explain how the current system works.
How does the current refugee regime work?
But not from an institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee.
Imagine a Syrian woman. Let's call her Amira.
For me, Amira represents
Many people I have met in the area.
Amira, like 25% of the world’s refugees, is a woman with children, and she can’t go home because she’s from this city you see: Homs. A city that was beautiful and historic and is now in ruins.
Amira can't go back.
But Amira has no hope of settling in a third country, because there is a lottery available at only less than 1% of refugees.
Amira and her family face an impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is that Amira takes her family to a camp.
In the camp, she could be helped, but there is little future for Amira and her family.
The camps are in austere and arid places, often in the desert.
In the Zaatari camp in Jordan, at night, you hear the bombings across the border.
Economic activity is restricted.
Education is often of poor quality.
Around 80% of the refugees in camps worldwide must stay there for at least 5 years.
It’s a miserable life, and that’s probably why, in reality, only 9% of Syrians choose this option.
An alternative for Amira is to head to the urban area of a neighboring country, such as Amman or Beirut.
It is an option chosen by about 75% of Syrian refugees.
But it also has difficulties.
Refugees in such urban areas often do not have the right to work.
They often do not have access to help.
And so when Amira and her family have spent all their savings, they will have nothing and will be in urban misery.
There is a third possibility that an increasing number of Syrians will choose.
Amira can seek hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and that is what we are seeing today in Europe.
We therefore offer refugees an almost impossible choice between three options: camp, urban misery or a dangerous journey.
For refugees, this choice is today's refugee system.
But I think that's a fake choice.
We can reconsider this choice.
The reason we limit these options is because we think these are the only options for refugees, but they are not.
Politicians see this as a zero-sum problem, if we benefit refugees, citizens pay the price.
We tend to think that refugees are an inevitable cost or a burden to society.
But they don't have to be. They can contribute.
What I mean is that there are ways to increase opportunities and that everyone benefits from it: host countries and communities, our societies and refugees.
And I want to suggest four ways to transform our vision of refugees.
These four points of view have one thing in common: they include opportunities for globalization, mobility and markets, and modernize the way we think about the refugee problem.
The first idea is that of favorable environments. It begins with the fundamental recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but with extraordinary circumstances.
Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we embarked on a research project in Uganda, observing the economic life of the refugees.
We chose Uganda, not because it is representative of all host countries.
He's exceptional.
Unlike the majority of host countries, Uganda has given refugees an economic opportunity.
It gives them the right to work, the freedom to move.
And the results are extraordinary, for the refugees and for the host community.
In the capital, Kampala, we discovered that 21% of refugees own a trade employing people and 40% of these employees are natives of the host country.
In other words, refugees create work for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we have discovered extraordinary examples of dynamic and flourishing businesses.
For example, in a village called Nakivale, we have the example of Congolese refugees running digital music sharing companies.
We found a Rwandan who runs a company to allow young people to play video games on consoles and recycled televisions.
Despite the difficulties of extreme constraints, the refugees innovate and the man you see is a Congolese named Demou-Kay.
Demou-Kay arrived in the camp with very few possessions, but he wanted to become a director.
So, with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a camera and made movies.
He has made two documentaries with and for our team and he is creating a successful business with almost nothing.
These are the examples that should guide our response to refugees.
Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent on humanitarian aid, we must provide them with the opportunity for human development.
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are very important in the emergency phase, but we have to go further.
We must offer the opportunity for connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to banks.
Anything we take for granted, which integrates us into the global economy can and should be offered to refugees.
The second idea I want to talk about is the economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world have the approach that Uganda has.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees in this way.
But there are always pragmatic options that we can use.
Last April, I went to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist, Paul Collier, and we thought about an idea we had there with the international community and the government, an idea to create jobs for Syrians while supporting Jordan’s national development strategy.
This is the idea of an economic zone where we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees and the employment of the natives of the host country.
15 minutes from the Zaatari camp, which hosts 83 000 refugees, there is the development zone of King Hussein Bin Talal.
The government spent more than 100 million dollars connecting it to the power grid and the road network, but there were two things missing: access to labour and foreign investment
so that refugees can work there rather than being stranded in camps, support their families, develop skills through vocational training before returning to Syria.
We recognized that Jordan would benefit from it, its development strategy requiring the transition from a middle-income country to an industrial country.
Refugees would benefit, but it would also contribute to the reconstruction of Syria after the war, acknowledging that we must incubate refugees because they are the best resource to rebuild Syria.
We published this idea in the journal Foreign Affairs.
King Abdullah has taken up the idea.
This was announced at the London Conference on Syria and a test will begin during the summer.
The third idea I want to submit to you is the notion of preference between states and refugees leading to positive results that you see in this selfie where Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee are featured.
We rarely ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but we can do it and it will be better for everyone.
The economist Alvin Roth developed the idea of market adequacy, where the order of preference of the parties determines their possible correspondence.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym looked for ways to apply this idea to refugees, to ask refugees to rank destinations but also to allow states to classify the type of refugees desired on skills or language criteria, and then match them.
Of course, quotas on diversity and vulnerability should be put in place, but this is one way to increase the chances of correspondence.
The idea of correspondence is successfully used to, for example, distribute students to the university, match kidney donors and patients, and the algorithm exists on dating sites.
Why not apply this to give refugees choice?
It could also be used at the national level where one of the biggest challenges is to persuade local communities to accept refugees.
Currently, in my country, for example, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the city, which makes no sense.
Markets in adequacy make it possible to gather these preferences and to listen to the needs and demands of the host population and refugees.
The fourth idea I want to talk about is the principle of humanitarian visa.
The tragedies and disorders observed in Europe could have been avoided.
They come from a fundamental contradiction in the European policy on asylum: in order to seek asylum in Europe, you must arrive spontaneously by embarking on a dangerous journey that I have already spoken of.
But why are these journeys necessary in the era of low-cost airlines and modern consular means?
These trips are not necessary and, last year, they led to the death of more than 3 000 people on the borders of Europe and on European territory.
If refugees had the right to travel directly and to seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that. And we can do this through humanitarian visas that allow people to obtain a visa from an embassy or consulate of a neighboring country and then pay for their journey by ferry or plane to Europe.
It costs about €1 000 to pay a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands.
A low-cost flight from Bodrum to Frankfurt is €200.
If we allowed refugees, it would have major benefits.
This would save lives, it would diminish the smugglers’ market and mark the end of the disorder observed on the European front line in areas like the Greek islands.
It is the laws that prevent us from doing so, not a rational solution.
This is an idea that has been applied.
Brazil has taken a forward-thinking approach and more than 2 000 Syrians have obtained humanitarian visas, went to Brazil and, upon arrival, have applied for refugee status.
In this configuration, every Syrian who did this received refugee status and was recognized as a refugee.
There is a historical precedent.
Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents authorizing 450 000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel to Europe and apply for refugee status elsewhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Refugee Office has received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this viable strategy.
Each of these four ideas that I have presented to you are ways to expand Amira's choices.
These are ways that we have to increase the choice of refugees beyond these options, these three impossible options that I have detailed, while benefiting others.
In conclusion, we need a new perspective a vision that extends the choice of refugees but recognizes that they do not have to be a burden.
There is nothing inevitable about the fact that refugees are a cost.
Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are human beings with skills, talents, aspirations and the ability to contribute, if we allow them.
In the new world, migration will not stop.
What we have seen in Europe will continue for years.
People will still travel, people will be displaced and we need to find rational and realistic ways to manage it, not based on the old logics of humanitarian aid, charity, but built on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility.
I urge you to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was little, I dreamed of the ocean.
A wild place, very colorful and full of life, harboring strange and fantastic creatures.
I imagined big sharks reigning supreme and graceful sea turtles twirling through the corals.
First a marine biologist, then a photographer, I spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I dreamed of.
As you can see, I started exploring the water very early on.
But the first time I really went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
I remember perfectly giving determined palms to reach this old cannon embedded in a shallow coral reef.
When I was finally able to catch it, I looked up and found myself surrounded by fish of all the colors of the rainbow.
That day, I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Photographer specializing in marine conservation In 40 years on Earth, I had the immense privilege of exploring some of the wildest seascapes for National Geographic and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I photographed everything, from huge sharks to the tiny ones holding in the palm of my hand.
I felt the fish in the breath of the humpback whales feeding next to me in the cold waters of Canada, near the Great Bear Rainforest.
I even knew everything about the rituals in love with the green turtle in the Mozambique Channel.
We all leave a footprint on the ocean and vice versa.
And the pristine seas I dreamed of are always harder to find.
They are always smaller and more threatened.
While we humans maintain our role as the largest predator on the planet, I have witnessed direct repercussions and photographed them.
I thought for a long time I had to shock my audience with images that disturb to get him out of his indifference.
This approach has its merits, but I came back.
In my opinion, the best way to make a change is to sell love.
If you want, I'm a couple-maker and, as a photographer, I have an exceptional opportunity to reveal entire animals and ecosystems beneath the ocean surface.
You can’t love and fight for something if you don’t know about its existence.
Revealing this - that's all the power of marine photography.
Among the hundreds of underwater places I have seen, a handful of these landscapes have deeply affected me.
I saw the first of these landscapes, about 10 years ago, off the wild and steep coasts of South Africa.
Every summer, huge banks of sardines move north, a mass migration phenomenon called the Sardine Run.
A crazy race of these fish
where hordes of hungry and agile predators chase them.
Common dolphins hunt together and manage to isolate sardines from the main bench and create small benches.
They dive and trap the fish up, against the surface and rush to appreciate their wriggling feast.
Sharks follow closely.
For many people, sharks and dolphins are sworn enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they live together.
In fact, dolphins help sharks feed more effectively.
Without dolphins, the small benches created are more sparse and sharks often end up with a "sardine doughnut" or a bite of water.
I had a few animated moments with the sharks on the Sardine Run, but I know they don't see me as a prey.
I get shots and am jostled like all the other participants of this banquet fighter.
Let's leave the African coasts, to go east, through the immensity of the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
During the monsoon season, the manta rays of the entire archipelago travel to a tiny islet of Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Crustacean armies, most smaller than a marble, are the staple food of the manta rays.
When plankton concentrations are low, the manta rays feed on themselves and they make back, looped pirouettes like a puppy chasing his tail.
When the plankton density increases, the lines line up at the tail and form these long chains. Each delicious bite that escapes the first is swallowed by the second or the next.
When the concentration of plankton reaches its peak, the manta rays swim ever closer in a rotating movement by which they feed.
As they swirl in this narrow formation, the manta line column creates its own vortex, sucking and bringing the right plankton into the cavernous mouth of the rays.
The experience of diving among these countless rays is absolutely unforgettable.
The first time I photographed Hanifaru, the site was unprotected and threatened by development.
I worked with NGOs like Manta Trust, and my photos helped make Hanifaru a marine protected area.
Fishermen from the nearby islands hunted these manta rays, they used their skin to make traditional drums.
Today, they are the most fervent conservatives and the manta rays bring to the maldive economy more than 8 million dollars each year.
I always wanted to go back in time and see an era where the cards were incomplete or indicated: "Here dragons".
I approached the most by visiting these remote atolls in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
Far, far away, from the lines of the boats and fishing, diving into these waters is a poignant memory of what our oceans once looked alike.
Bassas da India is greatly unknown. It is a tiny corner of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
His barrier forms a shield that protects his inner lagoon, a nursery for the Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
Something told me they would be even more bold and more numerous at night.
I found myself facing more sharks than ever, gathered on a simple outcry.
Photographing and sharing moments like these reminds me why I chose this path.
A short time ago, I was working on a project in Lower California for National Geographic.
Halfway, going down the Pacific coast, is San Ignacio Lagoon, where the grey whale comes to give birth.
For a century, this coast was the scene of a systematic massacre, more than 20 000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred.
Today, the descendants of these same whales play on the surface with their offspring and they even interact with us.
This species has been remarkably derived.
On the other side of the peninsula is Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing have taken them to the gates of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to make their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next is a miracle.
In 2005, after only a decade of protection, scientists recorded the largest increase in fish.
But don't take my word for it, come with me.
In a breath, swim deep with me in the middle of one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
We all have the opportunity to raise hope.
And through my photos, I would like to convey the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And I would particularly like to highlight the resistance of nature to 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I must search hard to take photos like this, while creating images that show our respectful coexistence with the ocean that,
I hope, will become the everyday for me.
To thrive and survive doing my job, you really have to be an unwavering optimist.
I always work thinking that the next fabulous image that will serve my purpose is ready, just behind the next reef, in the heart of the next lagoon, or who knows, maybe in the next one.
When I moved to Harare in 1985, social justice was at the heart of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
The new government was emerging from a long war of independence and immediately announced a socialist program: health services, primary education became essentially free.
A significant expansion of rural health centres has placed about 80% of the population within two hours of walking of one of these centres, a truly remarkable achievement.
In 1980, the year of independence, 25% of Zimbabwe's children were completely immunized.
In 1990, a decade later, this proportion was 80%.
I felt extremely privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution.
The excitement, the camaraderie was palpable.
Working with brilliant Zimbabweans — scientists, doctors, activists — I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a progressive global movement for public health.
But there were considerable challenges.
Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.
I had taken care of a few AIDS patients in the early 80’s, during my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but — we had no idea what was waiting for Africa.
My first few days there, the infection rate was 2%.
It was going to skyrocket and reach one in four adults by my departure from Harare, 17 years later.
In the mid-90's, I had told hundreds of people in the strength of the age that they had HIV.
I had seen friends and colleagues, my students, die in the hospital.
In response to that, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
We were demonstrating the use of condoms.
We started school education, interventions in the workplace.
We were doing research. We were advising partners of infected men to protect themselves.
We worked hard, and back then I thought I was doing my best.
I provided excellent treatment, as good as possible.
But I was not talking about structural change.
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan spoke honestly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the director of the UN Peace Department.
At a memorial 10 years later, he said: “At the time, I thought I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that I could and should have done more to sound the alarm and gather support. »
The AIDS epidemic took the health community by surprise, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have died from this disease, I am not alone in having remorse and regret for not having done more, sooner.
But when I lived in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as a defender or a politician.
I was there because of my technical skills, my clinical skills and my epidemiological research.
For me, my job was to take care of patients and do research to better understand the patterns of transmission within the population, and I was hoping that we would slow down the spread of the virus.
I was aware that marginalized populations had a very high risk of having and dying from AIDS.
And in sugar plantations, which, up close, looked more like feudal strongholds than any modern company, 60% of pregnant women had HIV.
I worked to show that being infected was not a moral failure but rather a culture of male superiority, forced immigrant labour and colonialism.
The whites were largely spared.
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: begging people to change their individual behavior, use condoms, reduce the number of partners.
Infection rates were rising. And when treatment was available in the West, treatment that remained our most powerful weapon against the virus, it was not affordable for the African public sector.
I have not denounced the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or the underlying economic and political systems that raised infection rates in large groups of the population.
I rationalized my silence by telling myself that I was only a visitor in this country, that sounding the alarm could make me expel, prevent me from doing my job, taking care of my patients, doing much necessary research.
So I did not revolt against the government’s initial position on AIDS.
I did not express my concerns out loud.
Many doctors and health professionals may think that I have done nothing wrong.
Our pact with our patients, the Hippocrates oath and its variants, evokes the inviolability of the patient-doctor relationship.
I did everything I could for every patient I had.
But I knew that epidemics appear along the cracks in our society, reflecting not only our biology, but more notably patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class, etc.
That was true for AIDS.
This was true recently for Ebola.
Medical anthropologists like Paul Farmer, who worked on AIDS in Haiti, called it “structural violence.” Structural because inequalities are embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world, and are often invisible to the eyes of privileged people and to power; and violence because its impact — premature deaths, suffering, disease — is violent.
We do little for our patients if we do not recognize these social injustices.
Sounding the alarm is the first step towards good public health practice, and that is how we could gather back support to revolutionize and create change together.
Today, I do not remain silent.
I’m talking about a lot of things, even if they make those who listen to them uncomfortable, even if they make me uncomfortable.
Much of what I say is related to racial differences and institutionalized racism, things that are no longer supposed to exist in this country, much less in medical practice or public health.
But they exist and we pay them by shortening lives.
That is why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the current institutional and interpersonal violence facing people of color, embraced with our sad legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about it is fundamental to the successful completion of my work as a New York City Health Commissioner.
In New York, premature mortality — or dying before it is 65 — is 50 percent higher for black men than for whites.
In 2012, a black woman was 10 times more likely than a white woman to die while giving birth.
Although we have made huge strides to reduce infant mortality rates, a black baby is still nearly three times more likely than a white baby to die in his first year.
New York is no exception.
These statistics are paralleled with statistics made across the United States.
A recent analysis by the New York Times reported that there was, in the country,
1.5 million black men missing. They mentioned the fact that more than one in six black men who are now between 25 and 54 years old no longer lead a normal life, but were in prison or died prematurely.
There is a great injustice in the face of the daily and disproportionate violence against young black men, on which the attention of the recent protests of #BlackLivesMatter is focused.
But we must remember that persistently disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common diseases — heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV — diseases that can kill gently and silently and take even more black lives prematurely.
When the #BlackLivesMatter movement took shape, I was frustrated and angry that the medical community was reluctant to use the word “racism” in our research and work.
You must have felt something every time I said it.
Our students have participated in white-blouse demonstrations, but the majority of the medical community has stood aside while current discrimination continues to affect the pattern of disease and mortality.
And I am afraid that the fashion of a personalized and precise medicine, the search for biological or genetic targets for a more suitable treatment, could, inadvertently, make us lose sight of the global situation, that is to say the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, likes, fundamental factor in the determination of the health of the population: for too many of us, poor health.
As health professionals, in our daily work, whether in practice or in research, we are witnessing a great injustice: the homeless who are unable to follow medical advice because they have other priorities; transgender youth who think of suicide because our society is too rigid; the single mother who is made to feel responsible for the poor state of health of her child.
Our role as healthcare professionals is not only to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and promote change.
Whether it is by right or not, our position in society makes us very credible and we should not spoil that.
I regret not having spoken in Zimbabwe, and I have promised myself that, as the Health Commissioner of New York City, I will use every opportunity to sound the alarm and get support for health equity.
I will denounce racism, and I hope that you will join me, and I will join you in denouncing sexism or any other form of inequality.
It is time to stand up and, as a community, to denounce structural inequalities.
We don't need to have all the answers to call for change.
We only need courage.
The health of our patients, of all of us, depends on it.
By hand: how many of you have already deleted a Facebook friend because he had made an offensive remark about politics, religion, parenting, food?
How many of you avoid at least one person just so you don't have to talk to him?
Before, to have a polite conversation, we followed advice from Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": stick to the weather and your health.
But nowadays, with climate change and the anti-vaccination movement, these subjects... are no longer very safe.
The world in which we live, this world where any conversation can potentially evolve into controversy, where our politicians cannot talk to each other, and where even the most futile subjects have supporters and critics, this world is not normal.
Pew Research has done a study of 10 000 American adults and has found that, currently, we are more polarized, more divided, than ever before.
We make less compromise, which means we don’t listen to each other.
We decide where to live, who to marry and even who will be our friends, according to our already established convictions.
Again, that doesn’t mean we’re not listening.
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and, somewhere on the way, we have lost that balance.
This is partly because of the technology.
The cell phones you all have, either in your hands or close enough to be able to catch them quickly.
According to Pew Research, about a third of American teens send more than 100 text messages a day.
Many of them, the majority in fact, are likely to text their friends rather than talk to them face to face.
There's a great article in The Atlantic magazine
Written by Paul Barnwell, a high school teacher.
His students have done a communication project.
He wanted to teach them to talk about a particular subject without notes.
He said this: “I realized... »
"I realized that the ability to hold a conversation is perhaps the skill that is most neglected to be taught.
Children spend hours dialogue and ideas via screens, but they rarely have the opportunity to refine their interpersonal communication skills.
It may seem strange, but we have to ask ourselves: in the 21st century, what skill is more important than to know how to hold a coherent conversation?
My job is to talk to people: Nobel laureates, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers.
I talk to people I appreciate and others I don't like.
I speak to people I deeply disagree with.
But I always have some fantastic conversations with them.
For the next 10 minutes, I'd like to teach you how to talk and listen.
Many of you have already heard advice on this: looking people in the eye, thinking beforehand about interesting topics to talk about, looking at, nodding their heads and smiling to show your attention, repeating what you have heard or summarize it.
Forget all this.
It's shit.
There is no reason to learn to demonstrate that you are attentive, if you are actually attentive.
I use exactly the same skills as a professional interviewer as in my daily life.
So I’m going to teach you how to question people and it’s going to help you learn how to be better communicators.
Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and most importantly, without offending anyone.
We have all had extraordinary conversations.
We've had some. We know what it is.
The kind of conversation that makes you feel involved and inspired, or that makes you feel like you really have made a connection, or been perfectly understood.
There is no reason why most of our conversations should not be so.
I have 10 basic rules. I will explain them to you but honestly, if you take one and master it fully, you will already have better conversations.
Number 1 : no multitasking.
Not just put your phone, tablet or car keys, or what you have in your hand.
Be present.
Live in the moment.
Don't think about arguing with your boss,
Not what you're going to eat tonight.
If you want to finish the conversation, do it, but don't just be half-now.
Number 2 : do not teach a lesson.
If you want to give your opinion, without any opportunity to respond, discuss, react or grow, write a blog.
I have a very good reason not to invite criticism to my show: they are very boring.
Conservatives will hate Obama, food stamps and abortion.
The Liberals will hate the big banks, the oil industry, and Dick Cheney.
Completely predictable.
You don't want to be like that.
You have to start every conversation, with the idea that you are going to learn something.
Scott Peck, the famous therapist, said that for real listening, you have to fade.
Sometimes it means putting your own opinion aside.
He said that the speaker will feel this acceptance, and will become less and less vulnerable and will more likely offer the hidden corners of his mind to the listener.
Consider that you have things to learn.
Bill Nye: “Every person knows something you don’t know. »
I say this: every person is an expert in something.
Number 3 : Ask open-ended questions.
For that, get inspired by the journalists.
Start your questions with whom, what, when, where, why or how.
If you ask a complex question, the answer will be simple.
If I ask you, “Were you terrified? »
You will answer the most powerful word of this sentence, here “terrified”, and the answer will be yes or no.
“Were you angry? “Yes, very angry. »
Let them describe. They are the ones who know.
Ask questions such as, “How was it? »
“What did you feel? »
Because they might need a moment of reflection and you will then have a much more interesting answer.
Number 4 : follow the flow.
It means that ideas are going to come to your mind and you have to let them out of your mind.
We have often heard interviews where the guest speaks for several minutes, then the host resumes the floor and asks a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or to which it has already been answered.
The host probably stopped listening 2 minutes before because he was thinking about his next question, a very intelligent question he was determined to ask.
We do the same.
We're sitting around, talking to someone, and then we remember meeting with Hugh Jackman in a cafe.
We stop listening.
Stories and ideas will come to you.
You have to let them come and then go back.
Number 5: If you don't know, say you don't know.
People on the radio, especially on NPR, are more aware than what they say is recorded; so they are more careful when they talk about their expertise and what they are sure to know.
Do the same. Fish for overcaution.
The word should not be taken lightly.
Number 6 : do not compare your experience to theirs.
If they talk about the loss of a family member, don't talk about the loss of a family member.
If they talk about the problems they have at work, don't tell them you hate your work.
It's not the same thing, ever.
Every experience is unique.
More importantly, it's not about you.
No need to use this moment to prove that you are great or how much you have suffered.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking for his IQ, who replied, “No idea. Those who boast of their IQ are dummies. »
Conversations are not promotional opportunities.
Number 7: Try not to repeat yourself.
It's condescending and very boring and we tend to do it.
Especially during conversations at work, or with our children, we have a message to pass so we rephrase it tirelessly.
Don't do it.
Number 8 : save the details.
Frankly, no matter what years, names, dates and all those details you can't remember.
No matter. What matters is you.
People are interested in you, what you have in common.
Forget the details. Leave them aside.
Number 9 : this is not the last, but it is the most important.
Listen.
I cannot tell you how many important people have said that listening is perhaps the most important skill to develop.
Buddha said, and I paraphrase, “If your mouth is open, you do not learn. »
And Calvin Collidge said, “No one has ever been fired for listening. »
Why don't we listen to each other?
First, we prefer to speak.
When I speak, I have control.
I don't have to hear what I'm not interested in.
I am the center of attention.
I can put forward my identity.
But it’s not just that: we let ourselves be distracted.
We utter an average of 225 words per minute, but can listen to up to 500.
So our minds complete with 275 other words.
I know it takes effort and energy to pay attention to someone, but if you don't, it's not a conversation,
but rather two people shouting barely related sentences in the same place.
You have to listen to each other.
Stephen Covey said it very well:
“Many of us don’t listen to understand.
We listen to respond. »
One last rule, number 10 : be brief.
[A good conversation is like a mini-skirt: short enough to hold attention, and long enough to cover the subject. -- My sister] All this is back to a basic concept: be interested in others.
I grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was a ritual in my house.
People came to talk to my grandparents and after they left, my mother came to us and said, "You know who it was?
She was the finalist of Miss America.
He was the mayor of Sacramento.
She won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer. »
So I grew up believing that everyone has a hidden and quite awesome side.
I think that makes me a better host.
I keep my mouth closed as much as possible, I keep an open mind and I am always ready to be amazed and I am never disappointed.
Do the same.
Go talk to people, listen to them, and, above all, be prepared to be amazed.
Thank you.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I won medals in three different sports and national championships in Canada, played at an international level in basketball and I was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train 5 days a week in basketball and speed skating, work with high-quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be the best in my sport.
I do all this with the Special Olympics.
Does it change the way you perceive my person and my successes?
The world doesn’t see people like me as champions.
Not so long ago, people like me were running away and hiding.
The Special Olympics have evolved a lot since the beginning of 1968, but too often people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the general public.
People use the word "R" with me, and they think it's okay.
It is the word "delayed" or "arrears" used derogatoryly.
They can't imagine how much it hurts me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here for charity.
I am here because there is always a big problem with how many people perceive individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, all too often, how they do not see them at all.
Did you know that the world championships were held this year?
I was among the more than 6 500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries competing in Los Angeles.
There were more than 62 000 spectators at the opening ceremonies, and there was TSN and ESPN to cover the event.
Did you know that this event happened?
What do you think when you meet someone like me?
I am here today to challenge you to consider us equal.
The Special Olympics transforms the own identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perception of anyone watching the competition.
For those of you who do not know, the Special Olympics are for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
The Special Olympics are separate from the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
We offer high-quality, year-round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities, what changes lives and perception.
This movement has changed my life and that of so many other people.
And that has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities.
I was born epileptic and with intellectual disability.
Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12.
The more I grew, the more I felt that it was harder to stay up to the others, and I was angry and frustrated.
For a while, I didn't practice any sport, had no friends, and felt forgotten and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one thought they could play a sport, let alone be an important member for society.
In the 60's, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the physical condition of children with intellectual disabilities.
Using rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that it was simply the lack of opportunity to participate that led to physical condition problems.
Many people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competitions.
But pioneers like Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the founder of the Special Olympics, persevered, and the athletes of the Special Olympics gave them reason four and a half million times.
Before I joined the Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, and had little confidence in myself and I didn't have many friends.
When I arrived, however, everyone encouraged me a lot, supported me and let me be myself without being judged.
Now I’m a basketball player and speed skater who competed at the regional, national games, and this year, ended up at the World Summer Games in Los Angeles, where I was part of Canada’s first-ever basketball team to compete in the World Games.
I’m one of the more than four and a half million athletes from all over the world, and I’ve heard so many similar stories.
Being an athlete of the Special Olympics gives pride and dignity.
The Special Olympics also address significant health needs.
Studies have indicated that on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years younger than men without, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years younger than women without.
The Special Olympics keeps us healthy by making us active and getting us involved in a sport.
In addition, our coaches teach us nutrition and health.
The Special Olympics also provides free screening tests for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing medial care.
At the 2015 World Summer Games, my teammates from Team Canada and I were playing against the Nigeria team.
The day before our match, the Nigerian basketball team came to the World Games Athletes' screening for free to seven out of ten members and had the opportunity to hear clearly for the first time.
This change for them was incredible.
They were very excited, happy and confident, because their coaches could communicate orally with them.
And they were very moved because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the enthusiastic fans in the stands — the sounds we take for granted.
The Special Olympics do more than transform athletes in sport.
The Special Olympics transform their lives off the pitch.
This year, research has shown that almost half of adults in the U.S. do not experience a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44% of Americans who do not have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less tolerant and positive.
Then there is the word “R”, demonstrating that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people.
People use it as a usual term or an insult.
It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it’s deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the world.
People don't think it's insulting, but it is.
As my fellow global athlete and spokesperson John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political commentator who had used the word "R" as an insult, "Come join us one day at the Special Olympics.
You will see if you leave with your heart unchanged. »
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours before diving into the last night of weightlifting competition.
That night was a packed room when my teammate Jackie Barrett, Newfoundland’s Élan, raised 297 kg and 277 kg in squats — setting huge new records at the Special Olympics.
Jackie is a record holder among all Newfoundland weightlifters — not just at the Special Olympics but all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge celebrity in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted live his new record and was impressed with his performance.
50 years ago, few people imagined mentally impaired people who could do something like that.
This year, 60 000 spectators filled the famous LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremonies of the World Games and applaud athletes from 165 countries from around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were applauded and celebrated.
The Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud of themselves.
The Special Olympics teach the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and consideration.
Now I have dreams and successes in my sport, great coaches, respect and dignity, better health, and I pursue a career as a personal trainer.
I'm not hidden, mocked, and I'm here giving a TED talk.
The world is a different place thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still work to be done.
So the next time you see someone with intellectual disabilities, I hope you will see their talent.
The next time someone uses the word “R” next to you, I hope you tell them how hurtful it is.
I hope you will consider getting involved in the Special Olympics.
I'd like to leave you with one last thought.
Nelson Mandela said: “Sport has the power to change the world. »
The Special Olympics is changing the world by transforming four and a half million athletes and giving us a place to trust, meet friends, not be judged and feel and be champions.
Thank you very much.
No doubt you don’t know Kenema in Sierra Leone, or Arua in Nigeria.
For me these are the two most extraordinary places on Earth.
There, in hospitals, there is a community of nurses, doctors and scientists who have calmly fought one of the deadliest threats of humanity in years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is like the Ebola virus.
It can cause a high fever and can often be fatal.
But these people risk their lives every day, to protect individuals in their communities, and ultimately protect us all.
One of the most extraordinary things I learned about them, during one of my first visits, a long time ago, was that they started every morning - these difficult mornings on the front lines - singing.
They gather together, and they show their joy and strength.
Over the years, we have visited each other. I could be among them, sing, and write. It was extraordinary, because it reminds us that we are not only there for science, but that we are bound by a shared humanity.
You can imagine it, it's extremely important, vital even, when things started to change.
The situation changed in March 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea.
It was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was scary... We were all terrified.
We had been suspecting for some time that Lassa and Ebola viruses were more widespread than previously thought, that it could reach Kenema.
So, members of my team immediately joined Dr. Humarr Khan and his team on the field. We have implemented diagnostics to carry out molecular tests capable of detecting the arrival of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
We had already managed to control the Lassa virus. We knew how to do it, the team was remarkable.
We just had to give them the tools and the Ebola lab.
Unfortunately, that day has arrived.
On May 23, 2014, a woman arrived in the maternity service of the hospital. The team conducted the molecular tests and identified the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
It was an exceptional job.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely, and begin to understand what was going on.
It could have prevented what happened.
But the day it happened, the epidemic had been brewing for several months.
There were already hundreds of cases, surpassing all previous outbreaks.
She entered Sierra Leone, not like this singular case, but as a tidal wave.
We have worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to deal with the cases. The following week there were 31, then 92, then 147 cases, they all came to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could solve this problem.
We worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to help each person, and trying to get attention. We also did something else:
We did not throw away the blood tests, used to detect Ebola, we put them in a chemical to deactivate them. We packed and shipped them across the ocean.
We sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We also worked tirelessly, day after day. We quickly generated 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
The genome is the architect of a virus.
We all have one.
It indicates what we are made of, and transmits so much information about us.
The results of this kind of work are simple and very useful.
We took these 99 different viruses, we observed and compared them, and we found that, by comparing them to the three genomes that had previously been published in Guinea, the epidemic had emerged in Guinea several months earlier, and that, once in humans, it was transmitted from human to human.
This is very important when you want to determine how to intervene, because contact screening is essential.
It has also been discovered that the virus mutates by moving between humans.
Every mutation is important because diagnoses, vaccines, and our therapies are all based on the genome sequence. That's the guide.
Global health experts need to respond, develop and re-calibrate all their work accordingly.
But science doesn’t work that way. My position at the time was that I had the data and I could have worked in silo for months, analyze the data carefully, slowly, submit an article for publication, make some changes, and finally publish my data after the official publication.
This is how the status quo in science works.
This time, there is no question of doing so.
We had friends on the ground. For us, it was obvious that we needed help, a lot of help...
The first thing we did, as soon as the machine released the first sequences, was to publish them on the web.
We published them and issued a call for help.
And the help came!
Quickly, many people contacted us, surprised by the data we had published.
Some of the world’s greatest infectiologists were part of our community.
We worked together virtually, sharing regular calls, trying to track the virus minute by minute, to see how to stop it.
There are so many ways to form such communities.
Everyone, when the epidemic began to spread globally, wanted to learn, participate, and engage.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The number of volunteers was incredible, and the Internet connected us all.
Can you imagine that instead of being afraid of each other, we would say, “OK, let’s go, working together,
We will defeat this virus. »
The problem was that the data we used, while researching the web, was too limited for our purpose.
We're wasting a lot of opportunities in these cases.
So when the outbreak broke out in Kenema, we had 106 patient clinical records, and we made them public.
In our lab, we have shown that, with these 106 files, we can teach our computers to predict Ebola with an accuracy of about 100%.
We have developed an app that gives access to this information to on-site healthcare workers.
Unfortunately, 106 cases are not sufficient to consolidate and validate the data.
So we expected more data.
But we were still waiting for the data.
We are still waiting, confined to our silos, instead of working together.
This situation is no longer tolerable.
You, all of you, can't accept that anymore.
It's our life that's at stake.
Many people lost their lives, health workers, including colleagues who were dear to me. Five colleagues lost their lives: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Koroma and Mohamed Fullah.
These are just five of many among many in Kenema and beyond, dead, while the world was waiting and we were working, quietly and separately.
Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is fueled by mistrust, confusion and division.
While we are building barriers between us, the virus develops.
Unlike all other threats, in front of Ebola, we are all equal.
We are all on the same boat.
Ebola is on our threshold to all.
And so in this place, we share the same vulnerabilities, strengths, fears and hopes, I hope that we can work together and with pleasure.
One of my former students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and she discovered that the term “Kenema,” the hospital where we work in Sierra Leone, comes from Mende’s quote for “clear as a river, translucent and open to eyes.”
It had a special meaning for us, because, without knowing it, we had always thought that to honor individuals in Kenema, we had to work openly and together.
We have to do it.
We must all demand of ourselves and others, to be open to the other, when an epidemic occurs, and to fight it together.
Because this is neither the first Ebola outbreak, nor the last, and there are many other pathogens around us, like the Lassa virus.
The next outbreak could affect a city of millions of people.
It could start there and be transmitted by air.
It could even be deliberately scattered.
I know it's scary, I understand... but I also know, this experience proves to us, that we have the technology and the ability to win, to win and get ahead of other viruses.
But it is only possible if we collaborate in joy.
For Dr. Khan, and for all those who gave their lives, on the front, in this fight with us, let us be by their side in this struggle. Always.
Let us not leave the world with the stigma of the destruction caused by a virus. Let us illuminate it with the brightness of billions of hearts and minds working in unity.
Thank you.
